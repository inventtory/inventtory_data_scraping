Economic efficiency is ensured by using, as the microwave-absorbing and heating element, a material having both relatively low costs and excellent heat-generation efficiency and, simultaneously, applicability at the actual site can be enhanced, by generating low-temperature and high-temperature heat so as to enable sufficient thermal desorption regardless of the types of oils.",WO,,WO2016186242A1,,,,,,https://worldwide.espacenet.com/data/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=EPODOC&II=9&ND=3&adjacent=true&locale=en_EP&FT=D&date=20161124&CC=WO&NR=2016186242A1&KC=A1,,,"B09C1/06,F26B3/347",,WO2016186242A1,A1,"Patent 1: THERMAL DESORPTION SYSTEM FOR POLLUTED SOIL AND BALLAST, USING MICROWAVE INDIRECT- Inventor: , Inventor:, , KOH TAE HOON [KR], HWANG SEON KEUN [KR], , (+4), , Applicant: , Applicant:, , KOREA RAILROAD RES INST [KR], JINYIN CO LTD [KR], , CPC:  IPC: B09C1/06, F26B3/347 Publication info: WO2016186242 (A1), 2016-11-24 Priority date: 2015-05-18
