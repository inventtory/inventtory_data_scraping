CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
 The present application claims priority to Korean Application No. 10-2008-0036546, filed on Apr.  21, 2008, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein for all purposes by this reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The present invention relates to a reinforcement for rear seat backs which is provided between a rear package tray and a floor panel of a vehicle to protect a rear seat back from an impact transmitted from luggage in the trunk of the vehicle.
 2.  Description of Related Art
 Various kinds of luggage are stored in trunks of vehicles.  When the vehicles suddenly stop, the luggage in the trunks is moved forward by the force of inertia and may strike the backs of rear seats, thus causing the possibility of injury to
passengers, who are seated in the rear seats, attributable to impacts transmitted from the luggage to the rear seat backs.
 Therefore, reinforcements are typically provided in the rear seat backs.  Such reinforcements are also often required by various legislation.  Generally, rear seats for vehicles are configured such that seat backs are installed between rear
package trays and floor panels.  Luggage bars having various shapes are provided in the rear seat backs to reinforce the rear seat backs.
 A reinforcement for rear seat backs according to the conventional technique will be explained herein below.  However, this does not imply that the structure of the conventional technique was known prior to the filing date.
 As a representative example of the conventional rear seat back reinforcements, in the case of low-priced vehicles, a rear seat back reinforcing structure is realized by a method in which a cushion pad of a seat back is attached to a wire frame,
a luggage bar is installed between a rear package tray and a floor panel, and the wire frame is fastened to the luggage bar.
 Hereinafter, the conventional rear seat back reinforcement will be explained in detail with reference to FIG. 1.  In the case of lower-priced vehicles, one of the goals is to maximize the reinforcing effect using a minimum number of elements and
through a minimum number of processes of work, to thus reduce the production costs.  To achieve the above purpose, a structure in which only two luggage bars 90 are used and a lattice type wire frame 70 supports a seat back is proposed.  In detail, the
two luggage bars 90 are arranged to form a "V" shape.  The upper ends of the luggage bars 90 are bolted to a rear package tray 10, and the lower ends thereof are bolted to a floor panel 30.  The wire frame 70 is attached to the seat back to support the
seat back.  The upper end of the wire frame 70 is mounted to wire brackets 12, which are provided on the rear package tray 10.  Fastening members 72, each of which is bent downwards, are provided on the lower end of the wire frame 70, so that the wire
frame 70 can be bolted to the floor panel 30 via the fastening members 72.
 However, in the conventional rear seat back reinforcement having the above-mentioned construction, to fasten the wire frame to the rear package tray, three wire brackets 12 are respectively provided at left, right and center positions on the
upper end of the rear package tray.  To fasten the wire frame to the floor panel, the fastening members 72 are provided at left, right and center positions on the lower end of the wire frame.  These members for fastening the wire frame require bolting
processes, so that there is a disadvantage in that the number of elements and the number of work processes are markedly increased.  As such, the conventional rear seat back reinforcement requires a lot of effort and expense for installation and assembly
thereof, despite having a basic structure, and is thus not adapted to the purpose of the low-priced vehicle.
 The information disclosed in this Background of the Invention section is only for enhancement of understanding of the general background of the invention and should not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that this
information forms the prior art already known to a person skilled in the art.

upper end of the first luggage bar 500.  The second luggage bar 600 is fastened at the upper end thereof to a right portion of the rear package tray 100 and is fastened at the lower end thereof substantially to the medial portion of the floor panel 200. 
In the same manner, a bent holding member is formed on the upper end of the second luggage bar 600.  The wire frame 700 has a lattice shape to support the seat back and is fastened to the rear surface of the seat back.  The upper end of the wire frame
700 is held by the holding members of the first and second luggage bars 500 and 600.  In addition, the lower end of the wire frame 700, along with a mounting member of the lower end of the first or second luggage bar 500 or 600, is fastened to the floor
panel 200.
 With regard to the fastening of the lower ends of the luggage bars to the floor panel 200, preferably, the lower end of the first luggage bar 500 is fastened to the floor panel 200 at a position spaced apart leftwards from the medial position of
the floor panel 200 by a predetermined distance, and the lower end of the second luggage bar 600 is fastened to the floor panel 200 at a position spaced apart rightwards from the medial position of the floor panel 200 by a predetermined distance.  Due to
this arrangement of the luggage bars, the luggage bars form a "V" shape overall, and can stably protect the seat bar.
 The pre-coupling structure of the luggage bars will be explained herein below with reference to FIG. 4.  A guide pin 542, which is inserted into a though hole formed in the floor panel 200, is provided on at least one of the lower mounting
members 540 and 640 of the first and second luggage bars 500 and 600.  Thus, before the luggage bar 500 or 600 or both are fastened to the floor panel 200, the installation position thereof is determined by inserting the guide pin 542 into the through
hole in the floor panel 200.  As such, the first luggage bar 500 or the second luggage bar 600 or both are pre-fastened to the floor panel 200 using the guide pin 542, and, thereafter, they are fastened to the floor panel 200 along with the lower end of
the wire frame 700.  Furthermore, a center fastening member 722, which is protruded downwards by extending and bending part of the corresponding wire of the wire frame 700, is provided on the medial portion of the lower end of the wire frame 700. 
Preferably, the center fastening member 722, along with the lower mounting member 540 or 640 of the first or second luggage bar 500 or 600 having the guide pin 542, is fastened to the floor panel 200.  In a preferred example, shown in FIG. 4, the lower
mounting member 540 of the first luggage bar 500 is pre-fastened to the floor panel 200 using the guide pin 542, which is provided on the lower mounting member 540 so that the lower portion of the first luggage bar 500 is temporarily fastened on the
floor panel 200.  Subsequently, the lower mounting member 540 of the first luggage bar 500, along with the center fastening member 722 of the wire frame 700, is bolted to the floor panel 200.
 Hereinafter, the installation of the wire frame will be explained with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.  As shown in FIG. 3, the bent holding member 522 is provided on an upper mounting members 520 and 620 of each luggage bar 500, 600.  The left and
right members of the wire frame 700 are respectively held by the holding members 522 of the luggage bars 500 and 600.  The upper central portion of the wire frame 700 is held by the wire bracket 120, which is provided on the rear package tray 100.  The
holding member 522, which serves to hold the wire frame 700, can have various shapes.  Preferably, the holding member 522 is formed by bending the upper end of the luggage bar B such that it is spaced apart from the rear package tray 100 by a
predetermined distance.  The corresponding wire of the wire frame 700 is inserted into and held by the gap between the holding member 522 and the rear package tray 100.  The left and right fastening members 724, each of which is protruded downwards by
extending and bending parts of the corresponding wires of the wire frame 700, are respectively provided on the left and right members of the lower end of the wire frame 700.  The left and right fastening members 724 are fastened to the floor panel 200.
 The assembly of the rear seat back reinforcement according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention is as follows.  The upper mounting member 520 of the first luggage bar 500 is bolted to the rear package tray 100, and the guide pin
542 of the lower mounting member 540, which is provided on the lower end of the first luggage bar 500, is inserted into the through hole in the floor panel 200.  Thereafter the lower mounting member 540 of the first luggage bar 500 is pre-fastened to the
floor panel 200 using the guide pin 542.  An upper mounting member 620 of the second luggage bar 600 is bolted to the rear package tray 100, and the lower mounting member 640 of the second luggage bar 600 is bolted to the floor panel 200.  Subsequently,
the upper end of the wire frame 700 is held both by the holding members 522 of the first and second luggage bars 500 and 600 and by the wire bracket 120.  The lower center fastening member 722 of the wire frame 700, along with the first luggage bar 500,
is bolted to the floor panel 200, and, thereafter, the left and right fastening members 724 of the wire frame 700 are bolted to the floor panel 200.
 As described above, a reinforcement for rear seat backs according to the present invention having the above-mentioned construction can effectively protect a rear seat back despite the use of a relatively small number of elements.  Furthermore,
in the present invention, the shape of a luggage bar is improved so as to provide a substitute for brackets, so that the number of brackets provided on a rear package tray can be reduced, thus reducing the costs of producing the rear seat back
reinforcement despite ensuring the superior strength thereof.
 In addition, a lower center fastening part of a wire frame is aligned with a lower mounting member of the luggage bar, and the lower center fastening member and the lower mounting member are fastened to a floor panel together, thus reducing the
number of processes involved in the fastening operation.
