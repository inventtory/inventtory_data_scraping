abstract: 
 A self-coiling dent guard for protecting vehicles and other objects from
     damage caused by unwanted collisions is disclosed. The guard is comprised
     of a main body adapted to absorb the impact of colliding objects. A
     bistable spring strip is integrated within the main body of the guard,
     thus giving the guard its self-coiling properties. When not in use, a
     user may cause the guard to coil so as to be easily stored. A magnetic
     strip is attached to the length of the main body such that the guard may
     be removably attached to a vehicle or other object. A layer of felt
     covering the bottom of the guard protects the vehicle from being
     scratched when the guard is applied or removed.

BACKGROUND OF THE
INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The invention relates generally to removable devices for protecting vehicles and other objects from damage resulting from unwanted contact, and more specifically to a flexible, magnetically attachable guard having an integrated bistable spring
strip capable of coiling said guard for quick and easy storage.
 2.  Description of the Related Art
 Many vehicles currently sold are not equipped with adequate protection from unwanted contact from other vehicles and objects such as often occurs in parking lots, resulting in dings and other damage to the vehicle's finish (See FIG. 1).  To the
extent that vehicles are equipped with guards permanently attached to the side panels of the vehicle, the guards may be positioned at a height that does not properly protect the vehicle from damage caused by certain objects.  For example, a runaway
shopping cart is likely to collide with a parked vehicle at a point above that of most factory installed guards.  Moreover, many vehicle owners find permanently attached guards to be unsightly and thus, many vehicle manufacturers have discontinued
installing such guards in new production vehicles.
 Removable guards for vehicles are well known in the prior art.  Removable vehicle guards disclosed in the prior art allow vehicle owners to attach a guard to a vehicle, often magnetically, at a position of their choosing.  When not needed, the
vehicle owner may remove the guard and store it for later use.  For example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,498,697 to McGlone et al. ("McGlone"), teaches the use of a molded plastic or rubber tubing having an adhesively applied flexible magnet for removably
attaching the tubing to a vehicle.  One drawback of the design taught by McGlone is that the guard is difficult to store in the vehicle when not in use.  The rigid structure of the guard takes up valuable trunk or seating space when stored in the
vehicle.
 U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,188,407 to Villaveces et al. ("Villaveces") teaches a guard design that improves upon the guard design taught by McGlone.  Villaveces discloses a removable guard that is flexible, and therefore capable of being rolled up by the
user for storage in the vehicle when not in use.  However, one drawback of the guard design taught by Villaveces is that it requires a great deal of effort and time to roll up a guard that may be multiple feet in length.  Many vehicle owners do not find
it desirable to spend a great deal of time in rolling up a guard for storage, but rather, want to quickly store the guard.  Further, vehicle owners suffering from physical disabilities may find it exceedingly difficult to roll up such guards.  Therefore,
a need exists for a removable vehicle guard that is capable of being quickly and easily transformed into a compact form for storage.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 Accordingly, there is provided herein, a self-coiling dent guard that, in its preferred embodiments, is capable of being quickly and easily transformed into a compact form for storage when not in use.
 In one aspect of the invention, a flexible, high density foam, plastic, or other such resilient material is used to form the main body of the guard, such that the material will absorb the impact of objects that would otherwise cause damage to a
vehicle to which the guard is attached.  The outer portion of the main body of the guard, that is, the portion not in contact with the vehicle when attached, may be flat, rounded, or have any form suitable for its desired purpose.  Further, the surface
of the outer portion may be configured such that it is possible to imprint marketing logos or other text/graphics thereon.  The surface may also be prepared so as to permit the adhesion of a pre-printed logo cover.
 In another aspect of the invention, an arched, bistable spring strip is integrated within the main body of the guard.  The strip is configured to act in a manner similar to what is commonly known as a "slap bracelet," having two stable states. 
The spring strip has a linear stable state and a coiled stable state.  A user of the guard can straighten the guard and the integrated spring strip, causing the strip to transform into the linear stable state.  The guard may be attached to a vehicle when
in its linear state.  After removing the guard from the vehicle, the user may initiate the transformation of the guard from its linear state into its coiled state by slightly bending a portion of the guard (and integrated strip).  The potential energy
stored in the strip causes the strip to coil quickly and with very little effort exerted by the user.  Additionally, the strip acts to further reinforce the outer portion of the guard, thus providing additional dent protection capability.
 In yet another aspect of the invention, a flexible magnetic strip is attached to the main body of the guard on the side nearest the vehicle when attached thereto.  The magnetic strip is composed of a composite of magnetic materials imbedded in a
flexible polymer/plastic material.  The magnetic strip allows the guard to be securely attached to the outer metal surface of a vehicle or other object.  The user may easily remove the guard from the vehicle when desired.
 In yet another aspect of the invention, a soft material such as felt comprises a bottom layer and is attached to the main body and/or the magnetic strip such that said soft material is that portion of the guard that makes contact with the
vehicle when attached thereto.  The soft layer of material reduces the likelihood of the guard causing damage to the vehicle when being attached or removed. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS

 Preferred embodiments of the self-coiling magnetic dent guard according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 Referring to FIG. 2A, the self-coiling dent guard (hereinafter "guard") is shown from an elevated perspective view.  The guard 8 of the presently preferred embodiment is generally rectangular in shape when viewed from above, having a rounded top
side 10 along the length of the guard.  The guard 8 takes on primarily two stable states, a linear state and a coiled state.  The guard 8 as shown in FIG. 2A, is in its linear state, ready for attachment to a vehicle or other object.  The guard 8 is
comprised of a main body 12 strip that acts as the primary structure that resists the impact of objects colliding with the guard.  Integrated within the main body 12 is a bistable spring strip 14.  The spring strip 14 runs along the length of the guard 8
and functions in a manner similar to what is commonly referred to as a "slap bracelet." The bistable property of the spring strip 14 acts to give the guard 8 its linear and coiled states.  A flexible magnetic strip 16, also running along the length of
the guard 8, is attached to the main body 12 on the side opposite the top side (hereinafter "the bottom side").  The magnetic strip 16 allows the guard 8, when in its linear state, to be removably attached to a vehicle.  A soft material such as felt,
provides a bottom layer 18 that is configured to come into contact with the vehicle and thereby prevent the guard from scratching the vehicle when applying or removing the guard.
 Referring now to FIG. 2B, an elevated perspective view of the guard shown in FIG. 2A as said guard transitions from it linear state to its coiled state.  The guard may be induced to transform from its linear state to its coiled state by the
user.  The user may apply a bending force to the guard along its length so as to cause the guard to bend slightly.  When enough force is applied, the spring strip 14 will transition from its linear state to its coiled state, causing the flexible guard
(by means of a coiling force) to coil into a form that is compact and easily stored within the vehicle.
 Referring now to FIG. 3, an elevated view of two vehicles in which the door of one vehicle is impacting the door of another vehicle that is equipped with the guard shown in FIG. 2A.  A user of the present invention may attach the guard 8 along
the surface of a vehicle at any point in which the user anticipates the risk of unwanted contact.  The top side 10 of the main body 12 is adapted to absorb the impact of another object contacting the guard.  Although the presently preferred embodiment of
the guard is described herein as useful for protecting vehicles, it should be recognized by persons of ordinary skill in the art that the guard may be used to protect any number of other objects to which the guard is capable of being attached.  Moreover,
while the presently preferred embodiment includes a means for removably attaching the guard to a vehicle by incorporating a magnetic strip, other means that would permit the guard to be removably attached to an object are contemplated.  By way of
example, and not of limitation, alternate embodiments, illustrative bottom and cross-sectional views of which are shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, respectively, may include a means for removably attaching the guard to an object, such as a boat, by use of suction
devices (such as suction cups) that are configured to removably attach to substantially flat surfaces.
 Referring now to FIG. 4, an elevated perspective view of the guard 8 showing a portion of the main body 12 of the guard 8 of the present invention "cut away" to reveal the spring strip 14 and the magnetic strip 16.  The main body of the guard,
in the presently preferred embodiment, is constructed of high density polyethylene foam.  However, other resilient, yet similarly flexible materials, may be used to construct the main body of the guard.  The spring strip 14 is embedded within the main
body 12 and runs along the length thereof.  However, it is contemplated that alternate embodiments of the invention will include one or more embedded spring strips that do not run along the entire length of the main body, but only along a length that is
necessary to provide the coiling function for which the strips are primarily utilized.
 The spring strip 14 of the presently preferred embodiment consists of a thin steel strip having properties of a bistable spring.  It should be noted that alternate embodiments of the guard may include a spring strip made of a material other than
steel, such as plastic.  The spring strip 14, in its linear stable state, is arched such that the lengthwise edges 20 of the spring strip are bent towards the top side of the guard 8.  The bistable properties of the spring strip 14 provide the necessary
force to coil the guard when so induced.  In its linear state, the spring strip also provides additional protection from impacts to the guard.
 Still referring to FIG. 4, the magnetic strip 16 is attached to the bottom side of the main body.  The magnetic strip 16 is flexible and is comprised of a composite of magnetic materials imbedded in a polymer/plastic material.  However, it is
contemplated that alternate embodiments of the magnetic strip may be constructed of other suitable magnetic materials if the use of such magnetic materials does not interfere with the ability of the guard to be transformed into a compact form.  It is
contemplated that any flexible strip having magnetic properties may be utilized.  While the magnetic strip 16 of the presently preferred embodiment runs along the entire length of the guard, alternate embodiments may be constructed such that the magnetic
strip does not run along the entire length of the guard, but rather only a portion thereof.  Moreover, other alternate embodiments of the guard may include multiple magnetic strips or magnets placed along the length of the guard.  As mentioned above, a
magnetic strip is not an essential element of the present invention, but rather, it is essential that the guard include some means for removably attaching the guard to an object.
 Referring now to FIG. 5, a cross-sectional view of the guard shown at FIG. 4.  The main body 12, spring strip 14, and magnetic strip 16 are clearly visible.  The arched nature of the spring strip 14 in its linear stable state is shown.  A soft
bottom layer 18, constructed of felt in the presently preferred embodiment, is shown as attached to the bottom side of the main body 12 and the magnetic strip 16.  A channel 17 is formed under the bottom of the main body 12 to receive the magnetic strip
16.  The soft bottom layer 20 protects the surface of the vehicle from damage that may otherwise be caused when the guard contacts the vehicle.  It should be noted that those skilled in the prior art will recognize that any number of soft materials other
than felt may be utilized to construct the bottom layer in alternate embodiments of the present invention.  Further, the bottom layer is not essential to the present invention in that it may be found that the magnetic strip chosen is sufficiently soft so
as to not cause damage to the vehicle when in contact.
 Referring now to FIG. 6, a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of the present invention, having an outer surface of the main body 12 of the guard 8 prepared for the placement of a logo.  The surface of the top side 10 of the main body
12, in alternate embodiments, may be prepared so as to apply or print text and/or graphics thereon.  Further alternate embodiments may include a transparent sleeve (not shown) in which to insert text and/or graphics.  The foregoing capability provides an
advantage over other prior art guards in that the guard may be used for marketing purposes of the user or of business interests that wish to sell or give the guard to others.
 It should be noted that alternate embodiments of the present invention may have various lengths and widths.  Further, alternate embodiments of the guard may be initially manufactured in greater lengths than would be desirable to apply to a
vehicle.  However, such lengthy guards may be cut into a length that is desired by a user or a business seeking to distribute the guards.  Sheers may be optionally supplied with the guards for cutting said guards to a desired length.  Additionally, a
storage pouch (not shown) may be optionally supplied with the guard for easy storage.
 It will now be evident to those skilled in the art that there has been described herein, a self-coiling dent guard that is easily transformed into a compact form for storage.  Although the invention hereof has been described by way of a
preferred embodiment, it will be evident that other adaptations and modifications can be employed without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.  The terms and expressions employed herein have been used as terms of description and not of
limitation; and thus, there is no intent of excluding equivalents, but on the contrary it is intended to cover any and all equivalents that may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
