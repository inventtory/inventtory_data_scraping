CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
 This application claims the priority of German Patent Application, Serial No. 10 2008 026 631.0, filed Jun.  4, 2008, pursuant to 35 U.S.C.  119(a)-(d), the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as if fully set
forth herein.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention relates to a dashboard support, and a method of making a dashboard support.
 The following discussion of related art is provided to assist the reader in understanding the advantages of the invention, and is not to be construed as an admission that this related art is prior art to this invention.
 Dashboard supports are used in motor vehicles as a support for various cockpit functions and include a cross member which is placed between the A-pillars transversely to the travel direction to provide a reinforcement of the vehicle body.  The
cross member is normally produced in the automobile industry from one or more support beams.  The dashboard has to meet several functions.  In addition to provide reinforcement of the body for absorbing energy in the event of a crash and to connect
various spatial points as well as to secure various holders for the instrument panel, the dashboard support is also used for mounting and securement of further functional vehicle components such as steering column, heating and air conditioning systems,
airbag, center console, fuse box or glove compartment.
 To secure the functional vehicle components or their mounts, holes, recesses, or protuberances are formed in the cross member as attachment points.  Some of the attachment points are provided with connecting elements, such as nuts or bolts. 
Other connecting elements may be placed later, although this procedure proved labor-intensive and cost-intensive.
 It would therefore be desirable and advantageous to provide an improved dashboard support which obviates prior art shortcomings and includes a cross member which is easy to manufacture and affords great flexibility for design options.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 According to one aspect of the present invention, a dashboard support for a motor vehicle includes a tubular cross member for installation between A-pillars of a vehicle body, with the cross member having at least one slot oriented in a
direction transversely to a longitudinal axis of the cross member, and a holder joined to the cross member for attachment of functional vehicle components and having a limb received in the slot which is sized to allow adjustment of a position of the
holder in relation to the cross member before the holder is being joined to the cross member.
 The present invention resolves prior art problems by providing the cross member with a slot which is oriented in a direction transversely to a longitudinal axis of the cross member and allows the position of the holder to be adjusted relative to
the cross member before the holder is actually joined to the cross member and fixed in place.  The adjustment of the holder can hereby be realized by sliding and/or turning the limb of the holder in the slot.  As a result, the jointing position of cross
member and holder can be precisely established before joining the holder to the cross member.
 According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the slot may have a length which exceeds a diameter of the cross member by more than half.  In other words, the slot may extend by more than 180.degree.  about the circumference
of the cross member.  While the cross member is initially weakened as a result of the presence of the slot in order to gain a greater degree of freedom when attaching the holder, the subsequent joining operation between the holder and the cross member
reestablishes however the required stiffness of the dashboard support.
 The placement of the holder in the slot of the cross member allows a positioning of the holder translatorily in the direction of the X plane or Z plane as well as rotatorily, irrespective of a position of the cross member.  As a result, the
dashboard support can be modular in construction, whereby the cross member can be varied in relation to the position of the holder, or the position of the holder can be varied in relation to the cross member.  A radial or rotatory displacement causes a
turning of the holder with its limb.  The position of the pivot point is freely selectable in space as a result of the attachment of the holder to the cross member in accordance with the present invention.  Sliding the holder with its limb in the slot
results in a rotatory displacement of the holder in the X plane or Z plane.  The position of the holder is only limited by the lateral length of the limbs.
 According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the holder may have a U shaped configuration which is defined by two limbs interconnected by a bridge, with the cross member having two slots in parallel spaced-apart
relationship for receiving the limbs of the holder respectively.
 According to another aspect of the present invention, a method of making a dashboard support for a motor vehicle includes the steps of forming slots in a first member to be used as a cross member of the dashboard support, with the slots oriented
in a direction transversely to a longitudinal axis of the first member, inserting in the slots limbs of a second member to be used as a holder of the dashboard support, adjusting a position of the second member in relation to the first member to
establish a jointing position, and joining the second member to the first member.
 The width of the slots and the width of the limbs are hereby geometrically suited to one another to allow the limbs to move with little play in the slots.  Establishment of the jointing position can be realized by sliding and/or turning the
holder and the cross member relative to one another before the holder is actually secured to the cross member, e.g. by means of material union, such as welding or soldering.
 According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, two or more holders, e.g. for a steering column attachment, may be secured to the cross member at a defined axial distance to one another.
 According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the slots of the cross member can be oriented parallel to one another in a direction transversely to a longitudinal axis of the cross member.
 As the holder can be freely positioned, a wide variety of designs of a dashboard support can be produced on the basis of a basic module, without the need to produce new tools.  Only the orientation of cross member and holders relative to one
another is changed to satisfy the required position of the attachment, when assembled together.
 Providing the cross member with end flanges completes the dashboard support.  A method of making a dashboard support in accordance with the present invention is efficient and cost-effective and allows a widest range of design options in view of
the high degree of freedom in connection with the positioning of the various holders and the cross member. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 Throughout all the figures, same or corresponding elements may generally be indicated by same reference numerals.  These depicted embodiments are to be understood as illustrative of the invention and not as limiting in any way.  It should also
be understood that the figures are not necessarily to scale and that the embodiments are sometimes illustrated by graphic symbols, phantom lines, diagrammatic representations and fragmentary views.  In certain instances, details which are not necessary
for an understanding of the present invention or which render other details difficult to perceive may have been omitted.
 Turning now to the drawing, and in particular to FIG. 1, there is shown a perspective view of a dashboard support according to the present invention, generally designated by reference numeral 1.  The dashboard support 1 includes a cross member 2
which is installed transversely between unillustrated A-pillars of a motor vehicle.  The cross member 2 has a tubular configuration or is made from a tube as base module, and has opposite ends 3, 4 which are provided with flanges 5, 6, respectively.  The
dashboard support 1 is mounted to the A-pillars of a vehicle body via the flanges 5, 6.  Reference numeral 7 designates a mounting for a functional vehicle component, in this case a center console, and is joined to the cross member 2.
 As shown in particular in FIGS. 1 to 4, the cross member 2 is provided with slots 8, 9, 10, 11.  The slots 8, 9, 10, 11 are oriented radially transversely to the longitudinal axis L of the cross member 2 and extend over more than half of the
diameter of the cross member 2.  In other words, the slots 8, 9, 10, 11 extend over more than half of the circumference of the cross member 2.  Holders 12, 13 are placed in the slots 8, 9, 10, 11.  The holders 12, 13 have a U-shaped configuration,
defined by a bridge 14 and two limbs 15, 16.  The limbs 15, 16 of the holder 12 are inserted in the neighboring slots 8, 9 which are spaced-apart at a distance a1.  Likewise, the limbs 15, 16 of the holder 13 are inserted in the neighboring slots 10, 11
which are also spaced-apart at the distance a1.  The actual jointing position, i.e. desired holder position, is then adjusted by sliding and/or turning the holders 12, 13 and the cross member 2 relative to one another.  The holders 12, 13 may hereby be
moved translatorily in the X plane which lies in the longitudinal vehicle axis as well as in the Z plane which extends perpendicular thereto.  In addition, it is possible, to turn the holders 12, 13 in relation to the longitudinal axis L of the cross
member 2 in the slots 8, 9 and 10, 11, respectively.  The rotatory degree of freedom between the holders 12, 13 and the cross member 2 is made clear by arrow R in FIG. 6.  Once the jointing position has been established between the holders 12, 13 and the
cross member 2, the components are joined together through material union, e.g. welding or soldering.  The two holders 12, 13 are now disposed in parallel relationship at an axial distance a2.
 FIGS. 2 to 7 depict in greater detail the flexibility and design option of the dashboard support 1 and of the attachment of the holders 12, 13 to the cross member 2.  In FIG. 2, the holders 12, 13 assume a middle position.  In FIG. 3, the
holders 12, 13 assume a lower position, and in FIG. 4, the holders 12, 13 assume an upper position.
 FIG. 5 also shows holder 12 in the middle position.  FIG. 6 shows holder 12 in a position which is radially shifted in relation to a middle position, with reference numeral 12' indicating the radially shifted position.  The holder 12' is pivoted
or tilted in the radially shifted position in relation to the middle position.  FIG. 7 shows holder 12 in a position which is translatorily shifted in relation to a middle position, with reference numeral 12'' indicating the translatorily shifted
position.  The holder 12 has hereby been shifted with its limbs 15, 16 in the slots 8, 9, 10, 11 to the right in the drawing plane.
 A dashboard support 1 in accordance with the present invention is flexibly designed with a high degree of freedom for positioning the holder 12, 13 upon the cross member 2.  On the basis of a basic module, the position and orientation of the
holder 12, 13 and the cross member 2 can be widely varied.  The same components, namely the cross member 2 with the slots 8, 9, 10, 11 and the holders 12, 13, can be used to make different variations of a dashboard support 1.  The position of the holders
12, 13 and the cross member 2 can be adjusted to comply with vehicle specifications, and the holders 12, 13 and the cross member 2 can then be joined together in the required position.
 While the invention has been illustrated and described in connection with currently preferred embodiments shown and described in detail, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown since various modifications and structural changes may
be made without departing in any way from the spirit and scope of the present invention.  The embodiments were chosen and described in order to explain the principles of the invention and practical application to thereby enable a person skilled in the
art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
