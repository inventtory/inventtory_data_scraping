patent_description: 
This invention relates
generally to automotive bumper-to-body filler means and, more specifically, to such filler means having provisions incorporated therein for "springing back" to an original free position after being deflected for any reason.
With the advent of automobile bumpers having energy-absorber means associated therewith for returning the bumpers to their original positions after any movement or deflection occasioned by external impact thereagainst, such bumpers having
generally been spaced a predetermined distance apart from the adjacent automobile body, there has arisen a need to not only fill the space therebetween for the sake of appearance, but to assure that such filler will be able to deflect or buckle, etc.,
with movement of the bumper relative to the body and, thence, be able to return to its original position upon retraction by the energy-absorber type bumper.
Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide improved bumper-to-body filler means which satisfies the above-described need.
Another object of the invention is to provide improved bumper-to-body filler means including an exposed filler member, and associated nonexposed filler support members which support the filler member in a predetermined position intermediate the
bumper and the adjacent body and serve to cause the filler to "spring back" after being deflected or buckled for any reason, such as by external impact thereagainst or against the automobile bumper.
A further object of the invention is to provide improved bumper-to-body filler means including a filler member extending across the width of the automobile in the space between the bumper and the adjacent automobile body, and left- and right-hand
support members therefor, each of such support members including an upper wall to which the filler member is secured, a lower wall which is secured to the bumper assembly, and one end wall interconnecting the upper and lower walls, with a plurality of
spaced U-shaped brackets or ribs formed around the inner surfaces of the upper, end, and lower walls, serving to provide a spring-back action to the end and upper walls and, hence, to the filler member in the event of any deflection thereof resulting
from an external source impact against the associated bumper. These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent when reference is made to the following description and accompanying drawings, wherein:
FIG. 1 is a rear view of an automobile embodying the invention;
FIGS. 2 and 3 are fragmentary cross-sectional views taken along the planes of lines 2--2 and 3--3, respectively, of FIG. 1, and looking in the direction of the arrows; and
FIG. 4 is an exploded perspective view of a portion of the FIG. 1 structure. Referring now to the drawings in greater detail, FIG. 1 illustrates an automobile 10 having a rear bumper 12 mounted laterally thereacross, just below a pair of
tail light housings 14 mounted substantially at the corners of the automobile body and an intermediate body portion 16.  The latter body portion 16 may consist of a metal strip or a series of laterally aligned back-up light and/or turn signal lenses
mounted adjacent the bottom edge of a trunk lid 18.  A housing or compartment 20 for a license plate mounting bracket and/or a gasoline tank inlet cover may be formed so as to separate the body portion 16 into left- and right-hand sections.
A bumper-to-body flexible filler and filler support arrangement 22 is mounted longitudinally between the bumper 12 and the rear body sections 16, and laterally between the tail light housings 14.
As illustrated in FIGS. 2-4, the bumper-to-body flexible filler and filler support arrangement 22 includes a molded plastic filler member 24 mounted on substantially a horizontal or slightly upwardly sloping plane, as desired, in the space
between the upper edge of the bumper and the bottom edges of the body portion 16.  As may be noted in FIG. 4, the filler member 24 includes a central open portion which serves as the compartment 20, the central open portion being formed to include bottom
and side walls 26 and 28, respectively, and a U-shaped flange 30 formed along the rear edges of the bottom and side walls 26 and 28.  Apertures 32, formed in the side walls 28, serve as a means for mounting light sources 34 (FIGS. 1 and 2) for
illuminating the usual license plate which may be mounted therebetween.  Substantially vertical, downwardly extending flanges 36 and 38 are formed on the rear edge of the filler member 24, on respective opposite sides of the compartment 20 for a purpose
to be explained.
The filler member 24 is supported by a pair of left- and right-hand filler support members 40 and 42, respectively, (FIG. 4), each having an upper wall 44, a lower or bottom wall 46, and an end wall 48 interconnecting the upper and bottom walls. 
A plurality of flexible U-shaped support brackets or ribs 50 are formed so as to be secured along the outer edges thereof against the respective inner surfaces of the upper, bottom and end walls 44, 46, and 48.  The ribs 50 may be either separately
formed, detachable parts or integrally molded components of the filler member 24.
The filler member 24 is secured to the end walls 48 of the filled support members 40 and 42 by suitable fasteners 52 (FIG. 3) mounted through the respective flanges 36 and 38, while the filler support members 40 and 42, in turn, are secured to
the upper surface 54 of a reinforcement member 56 by suitable fasteners 58 (FIG. 2) mounted through the respective bottom walls 46.  The reinforcement member 56 is secured by any suitable means, such as welding, to the inner surface of the bumper 12.  As
may be noted in FIG. 4, the upper surface 54 of the reinforcement member 56 includes a plurality of pockets or slots 60 formed across the width thereof, i.e., perpendicular to the bumper 12, in order to better reinforce the bumper 12.  Suitable energy
absorbers 62 (FIG. 3) are secured by fasteners 64 adjacent the respective vertical mounting surfaces 66 (FIG. 4) formed adjacent the ends of the reinforcement member 56, to return the latter and its associated bumper 12 to its original position after any
impact-actuated movement thereof.  It may be also noted in FIG. 4 that the bottom walls 46 of the filler support members 40 and 42 are shaped so as to conform to the general shape of the surface 54 of the member 52, spanning any adjacent pockets 60.
The filler member 24 and the filler support members 40 and 42 are each formed of a suitable plastic material.  Upon impact, the plastic materials can deflect without damage thereto, with the ribs 50 providing a "spring" action for returning the
filler member 24 to its original position with respect to the bumper 12 and the laterally aligned lenses 16.
It should be apparent that the invention provides external means for enhancing the appearance of the rear portion of an automobile, while including inherent means for restoring the inventive assembly to its original position after having been
distorted by impact thereagainst.
It should also be apparent that the inventive filler and support arrangement may be used in conjunction with either a front or a rear bumper system.
While but one embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, other modifications thereof are possible.
