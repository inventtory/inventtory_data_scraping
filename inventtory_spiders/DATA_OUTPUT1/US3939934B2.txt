patent_description: 
The present invention relates to a longitudinal bearer arrangement in vehicles, especially passenger motor vehicles.
A motor vehicle is known in the art (British Pat.  No. 728,593 and French Pat.  No. 1,059,830) in which the longitudinal bearers are arranged paralled to the vehicle longitudinal axis and are arranged in a horizontal plane.  The driver seat
arranged in the center of the motor vehicle is slightly raised in the seating plane with respect to the slightly set-back co-driver seats provided laterally of the driver seat so that an inclination of the seat surfaces in the direction toward the rear
section of the vehicle results.  The advantage of this arrangement resides in that the driver seated in a raised position with respect to the co-drivers receives a good view over the entire vehicle and that, on the other, the lower-seated co-drivers
receive an optimum head clearance and large space-comfort.  However, when the motor vehicle rolls over, a large distance between the roof plane of the vehicle extending parallel to the longitudinal bearers and the longitudinal bearers has proved to be
disadvantageous because the rigidity of the vehicle construction decreases with increasing distance of the roof surface from the longitudinal bearers, provided the constructive expenditures are not enlarged.  Additionally, it is also disadvantageous that
the vehicle equipped with the known longitudinal bearer arrangement may readily come into contact with and become seated on the ground in case of road unevenness, i.e. may hit the ground and become stuck, for example, in the open terrain, especially when
the vehicle is loaded in the front section thereof by luggage and dynamically spring-deflects inwardly, i.e. downwardly.
In a small vehicle with a rear-engine provided preferably for city traffic, such as in U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,352,597 and German publication DOS No. 1,430,871, published Dec.  12, 1968, by Barenyi and Sacco, it is disclosed to provide the seat planes
of the driver seat and of the co-driver seat arranged to the rear of the driver with an inclination sloping down toward the rear section of the vehicle.  With this prior art arrangement, exclusively the floor sheet metal plate is inclined in direct
proximity of the driver seat in the rearward, downward direction by 1/10 degrees with respect to the horizontally arranged longitudinal bearers of the vehicle so that the distance between the knee joint of the driver and the floor plate is not increased
by the inclination of the driver seat in the direction toward the rear.  This prior art vehicle provided for city traffic, however, entails essentially the same disadvantages of the long roof columns as the prior art vehicle described in the British Pat. No. 728,593.
The present invention is concerned with the task to eliminate the disadvantages provided by the known longitudinal bearer arrangements in vehicles and to provide a motor vehicle, in which the rigidity of the vehicle construction and therewith the
safety during accident impacts is improved by a favorable longitudinal bearer arrangement and by simple constructive measures with the simultaneous reduction of the vehicle weight and in which the mounting and connections of seats, drive unit parts or
the like is facilitated.
The underlying problems are solved according to the present invention in that the longitudinal bearers rise in the vehicle longitudinal direction from the rear part of the vehicle in the direction towards the front part.  It is achieved by these
measures that the accident impacts impinging on the vehicle from in front or from the side thereof, are not disposed directly in the longitudinal plane of the longitudinal bearers and instead lift the vehicle so that already by the conversion of the
kinetic impact energy into rotation energy, a decrease of the accident impacts is produced.  It is furthermore possible in an advantageous manner by the forwardly rising longitudinal bearers that the vehicle body is considerably reinforced by reason of
the reduced distance in the forward part of the vehicle between the roof plane and the longitudinal bearers so that the safety of the vehicle passengers is increased also during rolling over.  A further advantage of the construction of the present
invention resides in the increased floor or ground clearance of the vehicle.  Due to the forwardly raised longitudinal bearers, the danger of contact and of a seating of the vehicle on the ground, when loaded and when carrying out downward spring
deflections, is reduced.
In a further advantageous construction of the present invention, the longitudinal bearers may extend parallel to the joint shaft of, for example, a vehicle equipped with front engine and rear drive, as viewed in top plan view and/or side view,
whereby the assembly of the joint shaft at the floor surfaces of the vehicle extending parallel to the longitudinal bearers is facilitated.  Furthermore, it has proved particularly appropriate for the assembly of the body if eventually provided
separating planes of the framework extend perpendicularly to the longitudinal bearers.
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a motor vehicle, especially passenger motor vehicle which avoids by simple means the aforementioned shortcomings and drawbacks encountered in the prior art.
Another object of the present invention resides in a longitudinal bearer arrangement for vehicles which increases the safety of the passengers and driver of the vehicle without significant increases in constructional expenditures.
A still further object of the present invention resides in a longitudinal bearer arrangement for passenger motor vehicles which permits an increase in the rigidity of the vehicle construction with simultaneous reduction of the vehicle weight
while simultaneously facilitating the assembly of the various vehicle parts.
Still another object of the present invention resides in a motor vehicle in which the danger of getting stuck on road unevenness, especially in open terrain, is considerably minimized. These and further objects, features and advantages of
the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings which show, for purposes of illustration only, an embodiment in accordance with the present invention, and wherein:
FIG. 1 is a somewhat schematic side view, partially in cross section, of a motor vehicle in accordance with the present invention.
FIG. 2 is a somewhat schematic perspective view of the framework in a motor vehicle according to the present invention.
FIG. 3 is a front view in perspective of the framework shown in FIG. 2.
FIG. 4 is a top plan view of the framework structure of FIG. 2. Referring now to FIG. 1, the motor vehicle generally designated by reference numeral 1 and illustrated in this Figure partially in cross section includes a vehicle passenger
cell 2 which is constituted essentially by the forwardly rising longitudinal bearers 3 and the front cross frame 4 and rear cross frame 5 connected thereto as well as by the roof structure 6.  As can be clearly seen from this Figure, the longitudinal
bearer 3 rises with respect to the horizontal ground plane by an angle of about 5.degree..  Furthermore, it may be seen from FIG. 1 that the longitudinal bearers extend only in the zone of the passenger compartment between the front and rear wheels. 
Moreover, it is contemplated that the longitudinal bearer extends in the longitudinally extending plane formed by the front and rear wheels on each side of the vehicle.
The longitudinal bearers 3 limit the door cut outs in the downward direction of the vehicle, and simultaneously represent the lateral bottom limit of the vehicle in the zone of the passenger compartment.  That is, the longitudinal bearers 3 are
connected with each other by the vehicle floor extending between the bearers 3 which are laterally spaced from one another as may be seen in FIGS. 2-4.  The seats 7 and 8 are directly arranged on the vehicle floor so that the advantage of a higher seat
arrangement of the driver compared to that of the passengers, together with simultaneous reduction of the lever arm from the center of gravity of the vehicle to the ground surface remains preserved.  As may be further seen in FIGS. 2-4, the longitudinal
bearers 3 are connected by means of the transverse cross beams 4 and 5, which may be disposed at the level on the lower edges of the windshield and/or the rear window and connected to the longitudinal bearers 3 by vertical supports 14 and 15.  The
vertical supports 14 and 15 may be slightly inclined toward the front and rear respectively in relation to the longitudinal bearers 3.  These vertical supports 14 and 15 as may be seen in FIG. 4, for example, are arranged in the longitudinal plane at
each side of the vehicle in which the longitudinal bearers 3 are included.  The framework structure defined by the longitudinal bearers 3 and the front cross frame member 4 and rear cross frame 5 define the extent of the passenger compartment.
Toward the front and rear of the vehicle, end sections adjoin the transverse frames 4 and 5.  These end sections are fashioned preferably to be more susceptible to deformation than the passenger compartment in order to absorb kinetic impact
energy by deformation in case of an accident while the passenger compartment is still resistent to such deformation.  The end section in the front may be, for example, the longitudinal support girder 10 between which the engine 9 of the vehicle is
arranged.  The joint shaft or Cardan shaft 11 for the rear drive 12 of the vehicle can then be supported in the vehicle advantageously in parallel to the longitudinal bearers 3.
Thus the framework members of this vehicle construction may be joined as seen for example in FIGS. 2-4.  This structural arrangement provides an assembly that is constructionally simple but yet the forces can be absorbed in the framework to the
greatest possible extent with the avoidance of shearing and torsional stresses.  In particular, the structural arrangement includes the cross bearer members in planes that are at right angles to the planes in which the longitudinally extending bearers 3
are provided.  Furthermore, because of the inclination of the longitudinal bearer members from the rear to the forward portion of the vehicle a larger ground clearance is obtained at the front of the vehicle, on the one hand, while, on the other hand,
the length of the vertical supports 14 of the forward transverse frame 4 is shortened, for example, in comparison with the rear supports 15.  As a result of this reduced length, these vertical supports of the forward transverse frame can absorb greater
forces in the case of vertical stresses, i.e. if the vehicle is overturned due to an accident, without having to enlarge the cross section.  This results very simply from the fact that the buckling resistance is the decisive factor for these supports
during stress thereon, which buckling resistance is a function of their length.  In this connection, it is to be kept in mind that the shortening of the length is important since the cross section of the vertical supports can not be chosen arbitrarily in
most cases because otherwise the possible door cut out and the leg freedom of the passengers is impaired.
While I have shown and described only one embodiment in accordance with the present invention, it is understood that the same is not limited thereto but is susceptible of numerous changes and modifications as known to those skilled in the art,
and I therefore do not wish to be limited to the details shown and described herein, but intend to cover all such changes and modifications as are encompassed by the scope of the appended claims.
