CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
 This application claims the priority of German Patent Application Serial No. 20 2009 013 150.5, filed October 2009, pursuant to 35 U.S.C.  119(a)-(d), the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention relates to a mounting system for the attachment of bumper covering, and in particular to a mounting system that includes a mounting strip, a guide profile and a locking slider.
 In DE 199 12 267 A1, a snap-in device is described, in particular for connecting a bumper covering to the fender of an automobile where the first component is provided with several stop bolts distanced from each other and the second component is
provided with a lock-in strip with corresponding lock-in openings for a mutual snap-in connection.  With this arrangement, it is possible to reduce the assembly time for mounting the bumper covering, however the snap-in connection itself it relatively
complex and constructed in a costly manner in order to realize a connection that can be subjected to high stress.
 In DE 10 2005 029 544 A1, a connection device is described for the attachment of a bumper component having a receiving groove for receiving an mounting strip extending along the bumper lateral component and a snap-in element disposed in the
receiving groove which co-operate with snap-in windows of the mounting strip, wherein the geometry of the connection device is configured such that defined forces of actuating and control of the snap-in element are preprogrammed for snapping in and
snapping out, in case of a crash.  In order to realize the control of the action, relatively many requirements for the design and configuration are demanded from the connection device, which contributes to the time and cost of the production.
 In DE 197 41 062 A1, a multiple function track is described for the secure and form-fitting mounting, aligning and fixing of motor vehicle body components.  These multiple function tracks are pre-mounted at the corresponding component and
provided with receiving openings in the form of key holes, into which attachment bolts that are fixed at the body engage during assembly.  This connection device also has a design which makes it quite expensive.
 In general, all snap-in connections suffer from the drawback that the more the device can withstand stress, the more difficult it is to disassemble.
 Thus, the problem remains to provide a mounting system for components of motor vehicles which permit a simple and fast assembly of the components and at the same time fulfill the requirements for quality relative to joint measurements and
tolerances.  In addition, the assembly and disassembly should be easy to carry out with few hand movements and without the need for specialized tools.
 It would therefore be desirable and advantageous to provide an improved mounting system that allows simple manufacture while using inexpensive materials and still reliably coping with loads and strain in the connection between bumper and motor
vehicle body.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 According to one aspect of the present invention, the mounting system for attachment of a bumper covering to a motor vehicle includes: a mounting strip disposed at the bumper covering and having receiving openings for engagement with attachment
devices, a guide profile for attachment to the body of a motor vehicle having attachment devices corresponding to the receiving openings in the mounting strip, and a locking slider for realizing a locking connection between the mounting strip and the
guide profile during assembly by engaging the attachment devices into the corresponding receiving openings, and wherein at least the guide profile and the locking slider are configured as separate components.
 The present invention resolves prior art problems by providing a mounting system that includes a mounting strip that has openings for receiving therein corresponding attachment devices.  The system further includes a guide profile.  The guide
profile is provided with attachment means which engage with the receiving openings of the mounting strip.  The mounting strip is combined with a locking slider which, upon assembly, provides a connection between the mounting strip and the guide profile. 
The guide profile and the locking bar slider are configured as separate components, while the mounting strip can be directly formed onto the bumper covering or configured as a separate component for clipping to the bumper covering.
 According to another aspect of the invention the attachment devices of the guide profile are configured as projecting hooks, projecting pockets and engagement slots.
 According to yet another aspect, during assembly, the mounting strip which includes openings for receiving the attachment devices of the guide profile is first combined with the locking slider with means necessary for providing a firm connection
with the mounting strip such as for example by clamping or clipping the locking slider to the mounting strip.  In addition, the locking slider is provided with locking means for engaging the attachment devices of the guide profile.  The locking means
include locking tongues, which engage with the projecting pockets of the guide profile, and locking webs which interact with the locking hooks of the guide profile.
 When mounting the bumper covering, the guide profile is first fastened to the body of the motor vehicle and parallel thereto, the locking slider is clamped or clipped to the mounting strip.  If the mounting strip is configured as a separate
component, it must first be clamped to the bumper covering.
 In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a bumper covering of the type where the mounting strip is already formed directly at the bumper covering is utilized.  Subsequently, the bumper covering is slid onto the guide profile at the
vehicle body such that the locking slider is moved downwardly until the locking tongues of the locking bar slider engage with the pocket-shaped locking devices of the attachment profile, while the locking webs of the locking slider interact with the
locking hooks of the attachment profile for operative engagement to thereby afix the bumper covering to the vehicle body.
 Dismounting this assembly is realized by simply pulling out the locking bar slider and then removing the bumper covering from the vehicle body.
 The advantages of this arrangement are the simplicity and efficiency of the mounting system.  In particular, with the system according to the present invention, an exact fit of the components can be realized relative to the X-, Y- and
Z-directions, wherein the Y-direction is considered the driving direction and the X-direction extends perpendicular to the driving direction and the Y-direction extends in vertical direction up and down.  The mounting system is arranged so that, prior to
the installation of the rear and/or front lights, all components are easily accessible from the exterior through the openings for the lights, and most of all, requiring no additional tools for the assembly itself, since a firm and secure connection
between bumper covering and the vehicle body is realized with the locking slider.
 The components of the mounting system, in particular, the mounting strip and the guide profile are advantageously made from thermoplastic material selected from the group of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA), polystyrene,
(PS) polyvinyl chloride (PVC) polycarbonate (PC) polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyacrylonitrile (PAN) polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), acrylonitrile butadiene stryrene (ABS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polycarbonate co-polymerisate (ABS-PC)
polyvinyl ether, styrene acrylonitrile (SAN), and/or polyoxymethylene (POM) and are produced by injection molding.  An advantageous embodiment of the mounting system according to the present invention provides that the locking slider is made from metal
via a cold-work process. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING
