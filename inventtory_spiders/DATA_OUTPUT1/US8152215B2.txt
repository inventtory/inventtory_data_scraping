BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The present invention relates to a utility vehicle including a vehicle body frame, a seat frame fastened to the vehicle body frame, a seat bottom fastened to the seat frame and a seat backrest fastened to the seat frame.
 2.  Description of the Related Art
 Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. 2007-276703 discloses an example of a conventional utility vehicle.  In the utility vehicle, an engine is mounted to a vehicle body frame and a plurality of pipe members are arranged to cover
the engine.  A seat on which a passenger is seated is fastened to a part of the pipe members.  In this utility vehicle, the seat includes a seat frame, a seat bottom and a seat backrest which are unitarily coupled to each other.  Therefore, the entire
seat is required to be changed even when only a specification of the seat frame is changed depending on a location of the seat, etc. This increases the kinds of the seats and inventory management of the seat is burdensome.  When the seat is assembled, it
is necessary to incorporate the seat frame into an interior of the seat bottom and the seat backrest, which makes it difficult to assemble the seat.
 Japanese Patent Publication No. 3340205 (FIGS. 5 and 6) discloses a seat including a seat frame constituted by round pipes having circular cross-sections, a seat bottom, and a seat backrest.  Since it is difficult to fabricate the round pipes
constituting the seat frame, a yield of the seat is not improved, and a manufacturing cost increases.  In addition, an outer surface of the seat frame constituted by the round pipes cannot be made in surface contact with an outer surface of a vehicle
body frame at a joint portion at which the seat frame is joined to the vehicle body frame.  For this reason, it is difficult to enhance a joint stiffness and a vibration resistance at the joint portion, which is not suitable in the utility vehicle which
tends to vibrate significantly.  Under the circumstances, there has been a need for a utility vehicle which can achieve an easier assembling process, reduction of a manufacturing cost, and a higher vibration resistance.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 A utility vehicle of the present invention comprises a vehicle body frame; a seat frame including a seat bottom support member and a seat backrest support member, at least the seat bottom support member and the seat backrest support member being
formed by square pipes; a seat bottom fastened to the seat bottom support member; and a seat backrest fastened to the seat backrest support member; wherein the seat bottom support member and the seat backrest support member of the seat frame are integral
with each other to have a bent portion; and the seat bottom support member of the seat frame is fastened to the vehicle body frame.
 In accordance with this configuration, since the seat bottom support member and the seat backrest support member of the seat frame are formed by the square pipes with rectangular cross-sections, the seat frame can be manufactured by bending and
welding the square pipes.  The seat can be assembled easily in such a manner that the seat bottom and the seat backrest are fastened to the seat frame.  Since the seat bottom support member constituted by the square pipes can be fastened to the vehicle
body frame in surface contact with the vehicle body frame, a vibration resistance of the utility vehicle, which tends to vibrate significantly, can be improved.  Furthermore, since the seat frame, the seat bottom and the seat backrest are manufactured as
separate components, only the seat frame can be changed in a case where only a specification of the seat frame is changed, depending on, for example, a location of the seat.
 The above and further objects and features of the invention will more fully be apparent from the following detailed description with accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

prepared.  Then, as shown in FIG. 7B, the square pipe 130 is cut in a triangular shape to form a triangular portion 132 on a side wall thereof.  Then, as shown in FIG. 7C, the square pipe 130 is bent at a portion having the triangular portion 132 in a
direction toward the triangular portion 132, thereby forming the bent portion 118a.  Then, the bent portion 118a is welded at the triangular portion 132.  Then, as shown in FIG. 7D, the reinforcement plate 122a and the seat belt accommodating portion 124
are mounted to the bent portion 118a.  The support pipe 106b and the support pipe 114b are manufactured unitarily via the bent portion 118b, in the steps similar to those shown in FIGS. 7A to 7D.
 FIG. 8 is a perspective view of the seat bottom 16 as viewed obliquely downward.  The seat bottom 16 is formed unitarily using synthetic resin.  An upper surface of the seat bottom 16 has a shape in which right and left side portions are higher
than a center portion to allow the passenger to be seated thereon comfortably.  Grooves 134a and 134b are formed on portions of a lower surface 16a of the seat bottom 16 which are opposite to an upper surface of the seat bottom support member 102 (FIG.
6), to extend in the forward and rearward direction.  The grooves 134a and 134b are configured to accommodate the support pipes 106a and 106b (FIG. 6), respectively.  At least one rubber-made damper 136, in this embodiment, two rubber-made dampers 136
are provided on the bottom surface of each of the grooves 134a and 134b such that the dampers 136 are spaced apart from each other in the forward and rearward direction.  Protrusions 138a are formed on the upper surfaces of the dampers 136, respectively. Holes 138b are formed on the bottom surfaces of the grooves 134a and 134b, respectively.  The protrusions 138a of the dampers 136 are fitted into the holes 138b, respectively.  On the inner side surfaces of the grooves 134a and 134b, there are formed
opposite surfaces 140a and 140b which are opposite to the side surfaces of the support pipes 106a and 106b (FIG. 6) of the seat frame 14 (FIG. 6), in a rightward and leftward direction.  Two first engagement mechanisms 142 are provided at a rear end
portion of a lower surface 16a of the seat bottom 16 such that they are spaced apart from each other in the rightward and leftward direction.  The first engagement mechanisms 142 are engaged with the cross member 80 (FIG. 5) from below.  A second
engagement mechanism 144 is provided at a front end portion of the lower surface 16a of the seat bottom 16.  The second engagement mechanism 144 is engaged with the coupling pipe 108 of the seat frame 14 (FIG. 6) from below.  The second engagement
mechanism 144 is configured to be operated manually to switch an engaged state and a disengaged state with respect to the coupling pipe 108.
 FIG. 9 is a perspective view showing a state where the seat backrest 18 is fastened to the seat frame 14.  FIG. 10 is a cross-sectional view taken along line X-X in FIG. 9.  Referring to FIG. 10, the seat backrest 18 includes a base portion 148a
formed of synthetic resin (urethane), a front plate portion 148b which is provided at a front surface of the base portion 148a and formed of synthetic resin, and a back plate portion 148c which is provided at a back surface of the base portion 148a and
formed of synthetic resin.  The front plate portion 148b forms a front surface 18a of the seat backrest 18.  The front surface 18a of the seat backrest 18 is bent such that right and left side portions are protrusive forward relative to a center portion
in the rightward and leftward direction to allow the passenger to be seated thereon comfortably.
 Referring to FIG. 9, the back surface 18b of the seat backrest 18 has a plurality of recesses 150 and a plurality of convex portions 152.  The recesses 150 are continuous vertically to form first accommodating spaces Q1 on the back surface 18b
to respectively correspond to the support pipes 114 and 114b, respectively.  The recesses 150 are continuous in the rightward and leftward direction to form second accommodating spaces Q2 on the back surface 18b to respectively correspond to the coupling
pipes 116a and 116b, respectively.  Holes 154 are formed on lower surfaces of the convex portions 152 provided above the first accommodating spaces Q1, to communicate with the first accommodating spaces Q1, respectively.  Tip end portions of the support
pipes 114a and 114b accommodated into the first accommodating spaces Q1 are inserted into the convex portions 152 through the holes 154, respectively.
 Referring to FIG. 9, the seat backrest 18 is fastened to the seat backrest support member 104 using the bolts 120 inserted into the holes 120a of the coupling pipes 116a and 116b, and others.  As shown in FIG. 10, in a state where the seat
backrest 18 is fastened to the seat backrest support member 104, the seat backrest support member 104 is in contact with the back surface 18b (i.e., bottom surfaces of the recesses 150) of the seat backrest 18, and the seat backrest support member 104 is
disposed forward relative to the rear surfaces of the convex portions 152.  The rear surfaces of the support pipes 114a and 114b and the rear surfaces of the coupling pipes 116a and 116b are disposed forward relative to rear surfaces of the convex
portions 152, respectively.  Side surfaces of the convex portions 152 arranged at right and left sides of the first accommodating spaces Q1 are opposite surfaces 152a and 152b which are opposite to the side surfaces of the support pipes 114a and 114b of
the seat frame 14, in the rightward and leftward direction.
 Referring to FIG. 3, when the seat S1 is mounted to the vehicle body frame 12, the front end portions of the two support pipes 106a and 106b of the seat frame 14 are placed on the support pipes 38 of the main frame 22, and their rear end
portions are placed on the cross member 80 of the sub-frame 24.  Thereby, the support pipe 106a of the seat bottom support member 102 is caused to be in surface contact with the plate 42 and the plate 88 of the vehicle body frame 12, the plate 112 (FIG.
6) of the seat bottom support member 102 is caused to be in surface contact with the plate 42 of the vehicle body frame 12, and the reinforcement plate 122b (FIG. 6) of the seat bottom support member 102 is caused to be in surface contact with the plate
88 of the vehicle body frame 12.  Then, as shown in FIG. 6, the four bolts 40 are inserted into the holes 110a, 110b, 112a and 128 of the seat frame 14 and into the holes 42a, 88a, 42a and 88a (FIG. 5) of the vehicle body frame 12 (FIG. 3), and the seat
frame 14 is fastened to the vehicle body frame 12 (FIG. 3) using these bolts 40.  Then, as shown in FIG. 3, the seat bottom 16 is fastened to the cross member 80 and to the seat frame 14 by the first engagement mechanisms 142 and the second engagement
mechanism 144.  Then, as shown in FIG. 9, the seat backrest 18 is fastened to the seat frame 14 using the bolts 120.
 In accordance with the utility vehicle 10 according to Embodiment 1, the seat frame 14 can be manufactured easily by bending and welding the square pipes.  The seats S1 to S4 can be easily assembled in such a manner that the seat bottom 16 and
the seat backrest 18 are fastened to the seat frame 14.  Since at least a portion of the seat bottom support member 102 is fastened to the vehicle body frame 12 in surface contact with the vehicle body frame 12, a sufficient fastening stiffness is
obtained and a vibration resistance of the utility vehicle 10, which tends to vibrate significantly, is improved.  Since the seat frame 14, the seat bottom 16 and the seat backrest 18 are separate members, only the seat frame 14 can be changed in a case
where only a specification of the seat frame 14 is changed.
 Since the seat backrest support member 104 of the seat frame 14 is disposed forward relative to the convex portions 152 provided on the back surface 18b of the seat backrest 18, it is possible to avoid, for example, a situation in which the
space for the rear seat S3 is reduced because of the presence of the seat backrest support member 104 of the seat frame 14 of the front seat S1.  In addition, it is possible to avoid a situation in which a loading space provided behind the rear seat S3
is reduced by the seat backrest support member 104 of the seat frame 14 of the rear seat S3.  Since the opposite surfaces 140a and 140b of the seat bottom 16, and the opposite surfaces 152a and 152b of the seat backrest 18 are opposite to the seat frame
14 in the rightward and leftward direction, lateral displacement of the seat bottom 16 and the seat backrest 18 can be prevented.  Furthermore, since these opposite surfaces enable the seat bottom 16 and the seat backrest 18 to be positioned with respect
to the seat frame 14, the seats S1 to S4 can be assembled more easily.
 The rubber-made dampers 136 (FIG. 8) can prevent generation of a noise at a contact portion between the seat bottom 16 and the seat bottom support member 102.  Because of a frictional force acting on a contact surface of the dampers 136 and the
seat bottom support member 102, displacement of the seat bottom 16 in the forward and rearward direction and in the rightward and leftward direction is suppressed, and as a result, the seat bottom 16 is stably fastened to the seat bottom support member
102.  Moreover, since the dampers 136 can be supported by the flat surface of the seat bottom support member 102 constituted by the square pipes, it is possible to prevent a localized force from being applied to the dampers 136.  As a result, a life of
the dampers 136 can be increased.

 FIG. 11 is a perspective view showing a configuration of a seat frame 160 of a utility vehicle according to Embodiment 2.  In the utility vehicle of Embodiment 2, the seat frame 160 includes first fastening portions 162 and the vehicle body
frame (not shown) includes second fastening portions 164 opposite to the first fastening portions 162, respectively.  Each fastening portion 162 has a plurality of (three in this embodiment) first mounting holes 166a, 166b and 166c arranged in the
forward and rearward direction, while each second fastening portion 164 has a second mounting hole 168 corresponding to one of the first mounting holes 166a, 166b and 166c.  The first fastening portion 162 is fastened to the second fastening portion 164
by the bolt 40 inserted into one of the first mounting holes 166a, 166b and 166c and into the second mounting hole 168.  In this configuration, the position of the seat frame 160 with respect to the vehicle body frame can be adjusted at three levels in
the forward and rearward direction.  The bolt 40 may be replaced by other suitable fastener member and the like.
 Alternatively, the second fastening portion 164 may have the first mounting holes 166a, 166b and 166c and the first fastening portion 162 may have the second mounting hole 168 corresponding to one of first mounting holes 166a, 166b and 166c.
Embodiment 3
 FIG. 12 is a cross-sectional view showing a configuration of a seat backrest 170 of a utility vehicle according to Embodiment 3.  In the utility vehicle of Embodiment 3, the seat backrest 170 has on a front surface 170a a swelling portion 172
extending protrusively and vertically along a backbone of the passenger.  In this configuration, the swelling portion 172 serves to prevent the body of the passenger from being displaced with respect to the seat backrest 170 in the rightward and leftward
direction.
Other Embodiment
 Although the four seats S1 to S4 arranged at the front and rear sides and at the right and left sides in the above embodiments, the number and arrangement of the seats may be suitably changed as desired.  For example, only the seats S1 and S2
may be arranged at the right and left sides, or otherwise only the seats S1 and S3 may be arranged at the front and rear sides in a two-seated utility vehicle.
