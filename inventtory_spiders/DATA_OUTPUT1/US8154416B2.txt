abstract: 
 In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an alarm assembly
     for a wheel chair is disclosed. A pair of mounting brackets is combined
     to the frame underneath the seat of the wheel chair. A removable and
     extendable switch-bar selectively combines to the mounting brackets. The
     switch-bar is adjustable in length to accommodate chairs of various
     widths and selectively positionable on the mounting brackets to change
     the distance between the seat and switch. The switch on the switch-bar
     senses the presence of a patient and in response to the absence of a
     patient communicates an alarm signal to the alarm.

TECHNICAL FIELD
 The disclosure relates to a wheel chair alarm system, specifically a removable and adjustable alarm system.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
 Although wheel chair alarms exist, the construction of these alarm systems is not well suited to the practical use of wheel chairs.  Specifically, removing the prior art alarm systems for washing the chairs takes an inordinate amount of time. 
Alarm systems having electrical circuitry need to be removed when cleaning the chairs, otherwise damage to the alarm system may result.  Often alarm systems are combined to the chair in such a manner that the seat needs to be removed before removing the
alarm system.
 Accordingly, there is a need for an improved wheel chair alarm system that is easily removable.
SUMMARY
 In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an alarm assembly for a wheel chair is disclosed.  A pair of mounting brackets is combined to the frame underneath the seat of the wheel chair.  A removable and extendable switch-bar
selectively combines to the mounting brackets.  The switch-bar is adjustable in length to accommodate chairs of various widths and selectively positionable on the mounting brackets to change the distance between the seat and switch.  The switch on the
switch-bar senses the presence of a patient and in response to the absence of a patient communicates an alarm signal to the alarm. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
 These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description, taken together with the drawings wherein:
 FIG. 1 is a view of the wheel chair alarm system combined with the wheel chair;
 FIG. 2 is a view of the wheel chair alarm system;
 FIG. 3 is an enlarged perspective view of the switch-housing of the alarm system;
 FIG. 4 is an enlarged perspective view of the mounting brackets and the switch-bar's fingers of the alarm system; and
 FIG. 5 is an embodiment of the wheel chair alarm system removed from the wheel chair leaving only the mounting brackets combined with the wheel chair.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 FIG. 1 illustrates a wheelchair, generally shown as 10.  The alarm system, generally indicated as 12 and described in further detail below, may be used on any type of wheelchair, and thus the one depicted herein is provided solely for
illustrative purposes and is not intended to be limiting.  The alarm system may be installed in the wheelchair 10 as original equipment (i.e. the wheelchair manufacture may install it as part of assembly), or it may be a retrofit system designed to be
installed to existing wheelchairs 10 in the field, or used by those purchasing wheelchairs for purposes of retrofitting prior to usage.
 Generally, wheelchairs 10 are measured according to the width of the seat 102.  A standard wheel chair 10 has a seat width of 18 inches.  Generally, the overall width of the wheel chair 10 with an 18 inch seat 102 has a width of 24.5 to 26.5
inches.  Wheel chair 10 seat widths may be greater than 18 inches to accommodate larger patients, including seats 102 up to 24 inches.  A 24 inch seat 102 may have an overall width of 32 inches.  Accordingly, the alarm system 12 is designed to
accommodate wheel chair widths of different sizes.
 Referring to FIGS. 2-3, the alarm system 12 comprises an alarm device 15, illustrated as an audible horn by way of example, operable to emit a warning signal.  The alarm device 15 may be mounted anywhere on the wheelchair 1, including on the
frame 101 or on the back of the seat 102.  In the illustrated embodiment, the alarm is mounted on the frame 101 underneath the seat 102 by a clip 151 that wraps around the frame 101.  The warning signal emitted by the alarm 15 may be of any type, such as
a visual signal (e.g., a warning light), an audible signal (e.g., a horn or beeping device), or a remote signal (e.g., a signal transmitted to a nursing station for alerting personnel).  Generally, the alarm device 15 may be of any suitable type and the
one illustrated herein is not intended to be limiting.
 An underseat alarm switch-housing 16 having an internal switch 18 is in communication with the alarm device 15.  The housing 16 has a top portion 161 and a bottom portion 162 combined by one or more springs 163.  In the normal position the
springs 163 hold the top portion 161 of the housing 16 up and the switch 18 disengaged; however, when pressure is applied to the top portion 161 the top portion moves downward engaging the switch 18, signaling the alarm that a patient is on the seat 10.
 In the illustrated embodiment, cable 17 provides communication between the switch-housing 16 and the alarm device 15; however, communication could be wireless by any known or future means of wireless communication (not shown).  In such a case,
the switch-housing 16 would have transmitter circuitry for communicating an alarm signal and the alarm device 15 would have receiver circuitry receiving the alarm signal.  Further, any type of switch 18 may be used and one skilled in the art would
recognize that the alarm device 15 could be programmed to cooperate with either a normally open or normally closed switch.
 The underseat alarm switch-housing 16 is connected to the wheelchair 10 by a removable and extendable switch-bar 14.  The switch-bar 14 has telescoping ends 141 for allowing the switch-bar 14 to expand and retract to fit various sizes of wheel
chairs 10.  The switch-bar 14 is also readily removable.  One or both ends 141 are retracted which allows the switch-bar 14 to be removed from the mounting brackets 13.  As illustrated in FIG. 5, the switch-bar 14 has been removed and the wheelchair 10
is free to be folded for storing, transporting, or cleaning.
 The illustrated embodiment discloses an alarm system 12 that is readily removable leaving the mounting brackets 13 combined with the wheel chair 10; therefore an embodiment provides brackets 13 constructed of rust proof material, such as
plastic.  Additionally, it may be advantageous to construct the switch-bar 14 and switch-housing 16 from rust proof material.
 In the illustrated embodiment, the switch-bar 14 is combined with the wheelchair 10 by the mounting brackets 13.  The mounting brackets 13 are uniquely designed to allow the switch-bar 14 to be readily and easily removed from the wheelchair 10
and also allow the distance of the switch-bar 14 from the bottom of the seat 102 and the top of the switch-housing 16 to be adjusted.  Since, wheelchair seats 102 are often made of fabric, heavier patients cause the seat 102 to flex downward more. 
Having a switch-bar 14 that is readily adjustable in height makes it easy for the nurse to lower the switch-bar 14 to accommodate heavier patients.
 FIG. 4 illustrates an embodiment of the mounting bracket 13.  The mounting bracket 13 is combined with the frame 101 by a clip 131 and tightened by wing-nuts 132.  The mounting bracket has a plurality of receptacles 20 for receiving a finger 19
on end of the switch-bar 14.  In an embodiment, several fingers 19 are vertically aligned to provide more contact surface for holding the switch-bar 14 in a more sturdy position.  The fingers 19 may be positioned in a plurality of positions in the
receptacle 20 for adjusting the height of the switch-bar 14.
 While the principles of the invention have been described herein, it is to be understood by those skilled in the art that this description is made only by way of example and not as a limitation as to the scope of the invention.  Other
embodiments are contemplated within the scope of the present invention in addition to the exemplary embodiments shown and described herein.  Modifications and substitutions by one of ordinary skill in the art are considered to be within the scope of the
present invention, which is not to be limited except by the following claims.
