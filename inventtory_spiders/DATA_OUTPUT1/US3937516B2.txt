patent_description: 
This invention relates to detachable motor vehicle extension compartments for vans and similar vehicles and to methods and apparatus for mounting the compartments on the
vehicle.
It is known to provide detachable extension compartments on pick-up trucks for the purpose of enclosing the otherwise open body of the truck and to provide detachable carriers on the tops of various vehicles, including vans and recreational
vehicles.  It is also known to extend the useable interior space of a vehicle body with various knock-down extensions usually constructed of flexible fabric in order that the extension may be folded into a non-use position.
The present invention contemplates a quite different system in which a body extension is fitted to the frame of a doorway in a vehicle in a special way requiring only a simple modification of the door frame which does not interfere with the
normal function of the door or doors when the body extension is not in place.  The system has its primary utility in providing additional interior space at the rear end of a van or other vehicle having a door or doors which swing about a generally
vertical hinge axis, although the principles of the system may be applied to any vehicle door frame.
The mounting arrangement includes a rigid mounting structure, usually in the shape of a complete or partial ring or picture-frame, which is detachably secured to the inner surfaces of the door frame after the door or doors have been fully opened. The mounting structure carries a coupling assembly which is attachable to the open end portion of the extension compartment in a manner to pull the latter horizontally into tight engagement with the vehicle body or with the mounting structure or with
both.
Ordinary the vehicle door is not removed from the vehicle when the extension compartment is attached, and in one embodiment of the present invention the vehicle door is employed as a side door for the compartment.  In this embodiment the
compartment is manufactured with a side door frame adjacent the open end of the compartment.  The vehicle door closes and opens this door frame when swinging between approximately 180.degree.  and 90.degree.  from its original closed position.
Alternatively the vehicle door may fit into a blind door frame in the exterior of the extension compartment or into a slot extending into the side wall of the compartment in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.
In a further embodiment the door or doors of the vehicle may be removed before mounting the extension compartment although this arrangement is not as convenient for the vehicle owner because it requires not only the work of detaching the doors
but also the necessity of storing the doors when not in use.
The compartment may be fitted interiorly with any desired equipment so as to serve, for example, as a kitchen or lavatory or dog kennel.  Alternatively the compartment may merely be employed as additional space for storage. The invention
will be further understood from the following more detailed description of several embodiments of the invention, taken with the drawings in which:
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a van having mounted thereon a rearwardly projecting extension compartment embodying the principles of the invention;
FIG. 2 is a schematic end view of a mounting ring embodying the principles of the invention;
FIG. 3 is a schematic side view of the mounting ring shown in FIG. 2;
FIG. 4 is a fragmentary view on an enlarged scale of a portion of FIG. 2;
FIG. 5 is a fragmentary view on an enlarged scale of a portion of FIG. 3;
FIG. 6 is a schematic fragmentary view illustrating a modified form of mounting ring;
FIG. 7 is a schematic side elevational view of a modified form of extension compartment;
FIG. 8 is a sectional view taken on the line 8 -- 8 of FIG. 7; and
FIG. 9 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a portion of the mounting frame illustrating part of the telescoping section thereof. FIG. 1 illustrates a typical motor van 10 of conventional construction fitted with an extension
compartment 12 constructed according to the present invention.  The van includes two rear doors each of which swings outwardly about a generally vertical axis located laterally of the longitudinal axis of the van 10.  The right hand door is illustrated
at 14 as being supported from the body of the van by upper and lower hinges 16 and 18.
The extension compartment 12 includes a rear box-like portion having an open forward end 13 which fits against the rear of the vehicle body so that the vehicle door frame provides communication between the interior of the box-like portion and the
interior of the vehicle.  The rear door 14 of the vehicle is shown as being in an approximately 90.degree.  open position with respect to the vehicle door frame, and in this position it resides within a door frame 20 in a side wall 22 of the compartment
12 so as to provide access from outside.  The door 14 includes a conventional handle and door latch assembly 24 which cooperates with complementary features in the compartment door frame 20 so as to releasably latch the door 14 in a closed position in a
conventional manner.  Opening of the door 14 relative to the compartment 12 is effected by swinging the door 14 about the hinges 16 and 18 to, for example, a position about 180.degree.  open with respect to the vehicle door frame.
In the illustrated embodiment the compartment 12 also includes a forwardly extending hollow portion which rests on top of the vehicle.  A strap 26 releasably secured to a gutter 28 on the vehicle may be employed to hold this portion of the
compartment in place.  Access may be by way of a door 30 hinged at 32 for swinging movement about a generally horizontal axis.  The rear of the compartment 12 may be provided with conventional features such as brake lights 34 and a bumper 36.  Windows 38
may be provided where desired.
The compartment 12 is releasably secured to the rear end of the vehicle by means of a mounting ring 40 illustrated schematically in FIGS. 2 and 3.  The mounting ring 40 is a rigid annular structure which is releasably secured in the door frame of
the vehicle and which in the illustrated embodiment is also releasably secured to the compartment 12.  In some constructions it may be desirable for the mounting ring 40 to be a permanent part of the compartment 12, but in either event the connection
between the ring 40 and the compartment 12 must provide for slight relative movement between the two structures in a direction generally parallel to the axes of the openings in the ring 40 and in the forward end of the compartment 12.
As shown in FIGS. 2 and 4 one means for releasably connecting the mounting ring 40 to a vehicle door frame 42 includes a plurality of spring-loaded latch pins 44 carried by the ring 40 and insertable into bushings 46 provided in the door frame
42.  The bushings 46 may be mounted by first drilling holes 48 of appropriate size in the door frame 42, inserting the bushings 46 in the holes 48 and permanently securing the bushings to the frame 42 with screws 50.  Each latch pin 44 resides in a hole
in the mounting ring 40 and is normally biased by a spiral spring 52 into the extended position shown in FIG. 4 so that its outer end projects into its respective bushing 46.  In the illustrated embodiment the outer end of the spring 52 is secured in a
radial hole in the latch pin 44 and the inner end bears against a plate 54 which is secured to the ring 40 by screws 56.  Manual retraction of a pin 44 is effected by grasping and pulling a pull ring 58 attached to the inner end of the pin 44.  Any
conventional locking feature (not shown) may be provided for releasably holding the pin 44 in a retracted position.
A suitable connection between the mounting ring 40 and the extension compartment 12 is illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 5.  As shown, the connection includes a plurality of rotatable studs 60 each journalled at 62 in a hole in the ring 40.  The studs
60 are generally parallel to the axis of the opening in the ring 40 and project from the ring 40 in a rearward direction with respect to the vehicle 10, that is in a direction toward the extension compartment 12.  The forward end of each stud 60 is
provided with a crank handle 64 which is accessible from the interior of the vehicle 10 when the mounting ring 40 is latched in the vehicle door frame 42 by the latch pins 44.  The outer end of each stud 60 is adapted to threadedly engage a tapped hole
in a boss 66 on the forward end of the compartment 12.  Upon rotation of the studs 60 by means of the cranks 64 the compartment 12 is drawn to the left as viewed in FIG. 3 so that the open end of the compartment 12 tightly engages the rear end of the
vehicle 10.  An annular resilient gasket 68 may be provided between the compartment 12 and the vehicle 10.
The mounting ring 40 may be constructed in any suitable manner so long as it possesses the strength and rigidity to support the compartment.  In the illustrated embodiment the ring 40 is constructed of four metal box members 72, 74, 76, 78 welded
at 70.  If desired each box member may be in the form of telescopic inner and outer box members so as to provide for adjustment of the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the ring 40.  For example, the vertical members 76 and 78 may each be formed in
two telescoping sections 76a and 76b as illustrated in FIG. 9.  The horizontal members 72 and 74 may be formed similarly.
FIG. 6 illustrates a mounting ring 40' having an outer face contoured so as to be compatible with differences between the shape of the ring 40 and a vehicle door frame 42.sup.1.  Some vehicle door frames are bevelled as shown at 82 in FIG. 6.
In the preferred embodiment direct access to the compartment 12 from outside is provided by a side doorway which can be closed by one of the doors of the vehicle 10, as shown at 14 in FIG. 1.  If it is not desired to have access to the
compartment through the rear doorway of the vehicle 10, the side walls of the compartment may be provided with retaining means for holding the rear doors of the vehicle in a 90.degree.  open position.  FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate a modified compartment
12.sup.1 having one side wall 84 fitted with a dummy door frame 86 for receiving a vehicle rear door and the opposite side wall 88 fitted with a slot 90 for receiving the other vehicle rear door.
The procedure for mounting the compartment 12 or 12.sup.1 on a vehicle 10 has been generally described above.  First, the rear doors of the vehicle 10 are opened but not removed.  It may be necessary to remove or modify the door stop devices, if
present, so as to permit opening to about 180.degree.  from the closed position.  Then the mounting ring 40, with the latching pins 44 in their retracted positions, is inserted into the vehicle door frame following which the pins 44 are released so as to
move outwardly into the bushings 46 in the door frame.  The bushings 46 will have been installed previously, and they do not interfere with the normal operation of the rear doors.  Next the compartment 12 is raised to the proper elevation and moved
horizontally toward the rear end of the vehicle 10 in a direction along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle 10 until the threaded ends of the studs 6 engage the bosses 66 on the open end of the compartment.  An operator inside the vehicle rotates the
studs 60 by means of the cranks 64 thereby pulling the open end of the compartment 10 into tight engagement with the rear of the vehicle.
