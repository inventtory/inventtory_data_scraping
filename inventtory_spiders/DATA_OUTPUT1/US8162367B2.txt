patent_description: 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention generally relates to truck accessories, and more specifically, to a rack with retractable drawers for the bed of a pick-up truck.
 Current drawers for trucks take up the entire bed, and may be limited in what they can contain.
 As can be seen, there is a need for a rack with drawers for trucks that can be easily removed.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 In one aspect of the present invention, a device for a truck having a bed with a side wall includes: a rack adapted to be supported by the side wall; a drawer brace held by the rack above the truck bed; and a drawer attached to the drawer brace;
wherein the drawer extends from and retracts into the rack so as to be accessible from outside of the truck bed.
 In another aspect of the present invention, a storage device for a pickup truck having a bed with a side wall includes: a rack adapted to be supported by the side wall and to fit within a topper of the truck bed; a drawer brace held by the rack
above the truck bed; a drawer attached to the drawer brace; and a plurality of legs adapted to support the rack so that the drawer is held above the truck bed.
 These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description and claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out exemplary embodiments of the invention.  The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating
the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.
 Various inventive features are described below that can each be used independently of one another or in combination with other features.
 Broadly, an embodiment of the present invention generally provides a rack with retractable drawers suspended over the bed of a pick-up truck on the side walls or rails of the truck bed box.
 Embodiments of the present invention may congregate all tools and supplies in one place, and keep them secure so that they are not damaged or lost.  The tools may be accessible from outside the truck box using a retractable drawer system.
 An embodiment of a storage rack may be suspended above the bed of a pick-up truck supported on the side walls or rails of the bed box.  This configuration may keep the bed clear of obstacles and miscellaneous materials so that other items can be
easily loaded and unloaded.
 As depicted in FIG. 1, an embodiment of the present invention may include a rack 10 to allow a human person to contain and access items from outside the box of a pick-up truck 40.  A rack 10 may be supported by both side walls 42 of the box of
the truck 40, to lift the rack 10 above the bed 44 of the pick truck box.  Embodiments of a rack 10 may fit inside a topper 46 (cap or shell) of the truck 40, protected from the elements such as rain or snow.
 As depicted in FIG. 2, an embodiment of the present invention may include a rack 10 having legs 12 to support the rack 10 above the bed of the pick-up truck box on the side walls of the box of the truck.  Frame supports 28 may separate the legs
12 and maintain support for the rack 10 over the bed or box of the truck.  One or more leg braces 14 may spread the legs 12 and frame supports 28 as a unit and provide rigidity.  An embodiment of the rack 10 may be adjustable to fit truck box widths in a
range of, for example, 40''-78''.
 An embodiment may include a rack 10 to accommodate one or more drawers 16 supported by drawer supports 22 attached to the frame supports 28 and legs 12.  The drawer supports 22 may be separated by drawer spreaders 20 which work in conjunction
with drawer braces 18.  The rack 10 may be adjustable for height by leg adjusters 24.  The adjusters 24 may adjust the height of the rack 10 above the bed of the truck box from, for example, 0.5'' to 6''.  The rack 10 may comprise metal, square and
rectangular tubing ranging in size from, for example, 0.75''-2'' and other metal components to complete the rack 10.  The drawer 16 may fit within the rack 10 surrounded by the drawer support 22, drawer brace 18 and drawer support spreader 20.  The
drawer 16 may be mounted to the drawer brace 18 using a drawer slide 26, and the appropriate metal fastening items.  The slide may allow the drawer 16 to be extended and retracted from the rack 10.  The drawer 16 may be locked in the extended or
retracted position by a drawer lock.  This action allows the person to remain outside the box of the truck, extend the drawer 16, access the contents of the drawer 16, and then retract it into the rack 10.  This action can be accomplished from either the
side of the truck or the back of the truck at the tail gate.  The drawer 16 may comprise any hard, supportive material known in the art, including but not limited to wood, metal and plastic.  The drawer 16 may be shaped as a square or rectangle.
 As depicts in FIGS. 3, 4, and 5, an embodiment of a rack 10 may include a drawer 16 that slides in and out.  The drawer 16 may have a bottom 22''-27'' by 20''-29'' with (4) sides 3''-8'' in height.  The drawer 16 may contain items for the person
elevated above the bed of the truck box, leaving space to contain other larger items that are less likely to be scattered about and hard to retrieve without the person climbing into the box of the truck.
 In an embodiment, the legs 12 may be connected to the frame support 28 above the drawer support 22, and the legs may be spread apart for width by the drawer support spreader 20 and leg brace 14.  Connections may be performed by welding or other
attachment mechanisms.  The legs 12 may be welded to the frame support 28 at an angle, and typically a 110-120 degree angle.  The leg brace 14 and drawer support spreader 20 may be welded to the legs and frame support 28 at 90 degree angles.  The drawer
16 may be connected to the drawer brace 18 by metal and wood screws.  The drawer 16 may be assembled preferably with glue and staples.
 In an embodiment, the rack 10 may be suspended over the bed of a pickup truck.  Within the rack 10 may be 1-2 drawers 16 mounted on drawer slides 26 allowing the drawer 16 to be extended or retracted in or out of the rack.
 As depicted in FIG. 6, an alternate embodiment of the present invention may include a rack system 50 for a pick-up truck 40 supported by the truck side walls 42 to lift two racks 10 above the truck bed 44.  Embodiments of a rack system 50
include a storage device that may fit inside a truck topper 46.
 As depicted in FIG. 7, an embodiment of a rack system 50 may include two racks 10, each with legs 12, slidable drawers 16, and frame supports 28.  The rack system 50 may be supported by opposing side walls of the truck bed.  The drawers may
extend out the sides of the pickup.
 In an embodiment, the person in the cab of the truck may be protected from the contents of the drawer by a head bump screen attached to the rack on the cab side of the rack.
 An embodiment may provide a convenient way to secure and access items from outside the pick-up truck box.  All the items remain contained under the truck topper yet elevated above the box of the truck in the rack.  The person standing by the
side of the pick-up truck may swing the wing window of the topper (cap or shell) open, allowing access to the rack.  From the back of the pick-up truck, the person standing at the rear of the truck could open the back window of the topper (cap) and have
access to the rack.  Extending the drawer(s) over the rear end of the truck gives full access to the contents.  The drawer(s) may be retracted into the rack under the truck topper for protection and safe travel.  The human person no longer needs to crawl
up into the box of the pick-up truck to search for the item desired.
 It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates to exemplary embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.
