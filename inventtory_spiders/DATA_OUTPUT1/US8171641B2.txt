BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The present invention relates to a method of assembling a vehicle frame with components constructed from hydro-formed tubular members without a framing fixture.
 2.  Background Art
 One method of vehicle frame assembly is referred to as a balloon build method in which the vehicle frame is established by connecting a stamped metal front body section with a stamped metal rear body section.  This process maintains several
advantages which include a smaller manufacturing floor footprint and less manufacturing tooling requirements.  However, this method of assembly presents some unsatisfactory disadvantages such as an unacceptable side door opening dimension variation, wind
noise, and water leakage.  Dimensional errors usually occur in one of two fashions.  First, the front and rear components are constructed in a metal stamping process.  Metal stamping processes suffer from the need to allow tolerances that may stack-up
from part to part and cause a variance in vehicle lengths.  Second, variance in vehicle length may also occur if the front and rear components of the vehicle frame are not correctly assembled prior to welding.
 Another method of vehicle frame assembly is known as the multi-piece body side build wherein a plurality of smaller components are assembled and joined together to form the overall vehicle frame.  This method improves the side door opening
dimensions and provides more acceptable cross car dimensions.  However, because many of the smaller components are constructed using a metal stamping process, acceptable variations known as tolerances occur for each of the components.  These component
variations result in tolerance stack-up when the components are joined together.  Due to tolerance stack-up, this method is not able to rectify the wind noise or water leakage problems that had occurred in the balloon build method.  Also, this process
increases the manufacturing tool and floor space required to accommodate assembling the smaller components.
 Another method of vehicle frame assembly is known as a one-piece body side method.  This process requires the structural end item components to be added to the mainline body side process.  Larger portions of the vehicle such as the body side
door opening panel, roof, and underbody are assembled to the mainline body.  This process eliminates the gaps found in both the previous methods.  Also, this method virtually eliminates any wind noise or water leakage caused by tolerance stack-up or
imperfect joining of body parts.  However, this process requires an extremely large investment in body side fixtures to assemble large components, such as a body side door opening panel assembly.
 The previously demonstrated methods improved on vehicle design.  The balloon build method offers simplicity and low cost to build, but presents end result errors in how the vehicle body is joined together.  Furthermore, the multi-piece body side
build method improves side door opening dimensions, but does not solve the concerns of wind noise and water leakage.  Lastly, the one-piece body side method aids in solving many manufacturing process problems, however, the investment cost and amount of
manufacturing floor space are substantial disadvantages.
 The above problems and others are addressed according to the method of the present invention.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 A method is provided for assembling a frame of a vehicle using components that are each formed from a single piece of metal.  For example, the components may be hydro-formed, extruded or die cast components.  A first surface feature is formed to
extend along a first mating side of a first vehicle frame component.  A second surface feature is formed to extend along a second mating side of a second vehicle frame component.  The first surface feature is complementary to the second surface feature
in that the first and second mating sides fit together.  The first vehicle frame component and the second vehicle frame component are assembled together with the first surface feature interlocking with the second surface feature.  This interlocking
assembly is accomplished by locating the first vehicle frame component with the second vehicle frame component so that the first mating side lies flush with the second mating side.  Then, the first vehicle frame component and the second vehicle frame
component are joined together.
 The first surface feature may be elongated in a first direction that is parallel to the first vehicle frame component at the location of the first surface feature.  The step of hydro-forming the first vehicle frame component may further comprise
forming a step that extends transverse to the first direction.  The first surface feature may comprise a protrusion and the second surface feature may comprise an indentation.
 The first vehicle frame component and the second vehicle frame may be permanently joined by a weld, such as a laser weld, mig weld, or spot weld.
 The method may further comprise stamping a reinforcement beam and assembling the reinforcement beam to two spaced locations on one of the vehicle frame components thereby forming a subassembly.  The subassembly is formed before the first vehicle
frame component is assembled to the second vehicle frame component.
 A plurality of the first surface features and a plurality of the second surface features may be provided on the first vehicle frame component and the second vehicle frame component, respectively.  The first surface features and the second
surface features join the first vehicle frame component and the second vehicle frame component together.
 The vehicle frame component may have a plurality of peripherally spaced locating surface features disposed about the component, whereby one vehicle frame component may be assembled and joined to multiple other vehicle frame components.
 In another embodiment of the method of assembling a vehicle frame, a plurality of inverted U-shaped members are hydro-formed.  Each U-shaped member has a pair of spaced lower ends.  Also, a plurality of reinforcement members are formed.
 A vehicle subassembly is formed when at least one of the reinforcement members is assembled and joined to the pair of spaced lower ends of one of the inverted U-shaped members.  The joining of these two members establishes the spread of the
vehicle subassembly as measured between the pair of spaced lower ends.  Furthermore, the reinforcement member also establishes the distance from the stamped metal reinforcement member to the top of the inverted U-shaped member.  The vehicle frame is
assembled by joining a plurality of laterally adjacent vehicle subassemblies together.
 The vehicle frame is assembled by interlocking the locating surface feature of one vehicle subassembly U-shaped member with the locating feature of another vehicle subassembly U-shaped member.  The locating surface features of the vehicle
subassemblies U-shaped members can interlock in at least two spatial axes.
 The method of assembling the vehicle frame may also include forming and joining a passenger compartment pan to the vehicle subassemblies.  The top of the vehicle side subassemblies U-shaped members will define the height of the overall vehicle
once the side subassemblies reinforcement members are joined to the passenger compartment pan.  The vehicle front subassembly can then be joined to the passenger compartment pan by mating the locating surface features of the vehicle side subassemblies
with the locating surface features of the vehicle front subassembly and securing the reinforcement member of the front subassembly to the passenger compartment pan.  The vehicle rear subassembly can also be joined to the passenger compartment pan by
joining the locating surface features of the vehicle side subassembly with the locating surface locating features of the vehicle rear subassembly and then joining the rear subassembly reinforcement member to the passenger compartment pan.
 A vehicle frame is provided that is formed by a rear hoop, a front hoop and right and left side hoops.  The rear hoop has a right rear hoop locating surface feature and a left rear hoop locating surface feature.  The right side hoop has a front
right side locating surface feature and a rear right side locating surface feature.  The left side hoop has a front left side locating surface feature and a rear left side locating surface feature.  The front hoop has a right front hoop locating surface
feature and a left front hoop locating surface feature.  The front hoop is assembled and joined to the right side hoop with the right front hoop locating surface feature engaging the front right side locating surface feature.  The front hoop is assembled
and joined to the left side hoop with the left front hoop locating surface feature engaging the front left side locating surface feature.  The rear hoop is assembled and joined to the right side hoop with the right rear hoop locating surface feature
engaging the rear right side locating surface feature.  The rear hoop is assembled and joined to the left side hoop with the left rear hoop locating surface feature engaging the rear left side locating surface feature.

 Referring to FIG. 6, one method of assembling complimentary surface features together is described.  The hoop assemblies 18-24 are generally hydro-formed beams that may be assembled with a first mating side 56 engaging a second mating side 58 of
an adjacent beam.  A transverse locating feature 60 may be provided on one beam adjacent the second mating side 58 that engages a bend 62 formed proximate the first mating side 56 to establish the relative positions and location of the adjacent
hydro-formed hoop assemblies.
 Referring to FIG. 7, an example of two complimentary surface features is shown.  One of the hoop assemblies may include a hydro-formed beam having a ridge 66 that extends lengthwise to form one part of the locating feature.  The adjacent
hydro-formed beam defines a valley 68 that extends lengthwise to form a locating feature.  Welds 70 may be formed as shown that extend continuously or discontinuously in the seam formed by the co-location of the adjacent hoop assemblies 18-24.
 Referring to FIG. 8, another example of a surface feature is shown wherein a first protrusion 72 is formed by one hydro-formed beam that is located and secured to a second protrusion 74 formed on an adjacent hydro-formed beam of one of the hoop
assemblies 18-24.  Welds 76 are formed at the seam defined at the location where the first and second protrusions 72 and 74 are assembled together.  The welds 76 may be continuous or discontinuous and may be formed, in one example, by a laser welding
tool.  Alternatively, a mig welder or a tig welder could be used to form the welds 76.
 Referring to FIG. 9, an alternative embodiment 80 of the present invention is shown wherein a roof ring 82 is attached to a windshield frame 84 and roof rail 86.  In the embodiment of FIGS. 1-6, no roof ring 82 is required, but it should be
understood that a roof ring 82 could be provided as part of the vehicle frame 10 that defines the passenger compartment 12.
 Referring to FIG. 10, a convex curved wall 88 may be provided that receives a concave curved wall 90.  The convex curved wall 88 may be part of the roof rail 86 and the concave curved wall 90 may be formed as part of the windshield frame 84. 
Once the windshield frame 84 and roof rail 86 are located by the curved walls 88, 90, the parts are permanently joined together by welds 92.  The welds 92 are formed at the seams defined by the co-location of the windshield frame 84 and the roof rail 86.
 Referring to FIG. 11, another example of use of complimentary surface features to assemble adjacent portions of a vehicle frame together is shown.  In FIG. 11, a rib 96 is formed on the roof rail 86 that is adapted to receive a recess 98 formed
on the roof ring 82.  The rib 96 and recess 98 are complimentary and may be used to locate the roof ring 82 relative to the roof rail 86.  Welds 100 are formed preferably by a laser welding technique or other type of welding technique to join the roof
ring 82 to the roof rail 86.
 The method of assembling a vehicle frame 10 is described in pertinent part below.
 A first vehicle frame component, such as one of the hoop assemblies 18-24, is formed by hydro-forming a portion thereof from a single piece of tubular metal.  In the hydro-forming process, a first surface feature, such as feature surface 32, 44,
or 54, is formed along a first mating side 56 of the first vehicle frame component.  A second vehicle frame component, such as one of the hoop assemblies 18-24, is formed from a single piece of tubular metal.  The hydro-forming process includes the step
of forming a second surface feature that extends along a second mating side 58 of the second vehicle frame component.  The second surface feature is complimentary to the first surface feature.  The first vehicle frame component and second vehicle frame
component are assembled together with the first surface feature and the second surface feature being interlocked together to locate the first vehicle frame component and the second vehicle frame component.  The first mating side 56 is assembled flush to
the second mating side 58.  The first vehicle frame component is then joined to the second vehicle frame component by welding, as previously described.
 The surface feature may be elongated in a first direction that is parallel to the length of the first vehicle frame component.  The first vehicle frame component may also include a step 60 that extends transverse to the length of the portion of
the vehicle frame component wherein the first surface is located.
 The first surface feature may comprise a protrusion, such as the ridge 66 of FIG. 7, the first protrusion 72 of FIG. 8, the convex wall 88 of FIG. 10, or the rib 96 of FIG. 11.  A second feature may comprise an indentation, such as the valley 68
of FIG. 7, the inside of the second protrusion 74 of FIG. 8, the concave curve wall 90 of FIG. 10, or the recess 98 of FIG. 11.  The first and second surface features are complimentary formations that nest together when assembled.
 The first and second frame components are permanently joined by a weld, for example, welds 70, 76, 92 or 100.  As previously indicated, the weld may be a laser weld or other type of weld commonly used in assembling vehicle frame components.
 The method may further comprise stamping a reinforcement beam, such as the front cross car assembly 30, rocker panels 42 or rear wall 52.  The reinforcement beam is then assembled to two spaced locations on the hydro-formed component, such as
the windshield frame 28 as shown in FIG. 3, or the hinge pillar and body lock pillars 36 and 40 shown in FIG. 4.  Similarly, the rear wall 52 is assembled to the right and left body lock pillar portions 48, 50 of the rear hoop assembly 24.  The
reinforcement beam forms a sub-assembly prior to assembling the vehicle frame components, such as hoop assemblies 18-24 together to form the vehicle frame 10.
 A plurality of surface features may be provided on one vehicle frame component, while a complimentary plurality of surface features is provided on the next adjacent vehicle frame component.  The surface features on the first and second vehicle
frame components are joined together to form, in part, the vehicle frame 10.  A plurality of peripherally spaced locating surface features 32, 44, 54 may be disposed about the hoop assembly so that one vehicle frame component may be assembled and joined
to multiple other vehicle frame components.
 The method of assembling a vehicle frame may also be characterized by the following process.  A plurality of U-shaped members may be hydro-formed so that each have a pair of spaced lower ends.  The U-shaped members may comprise, for example, the
windshield frame 28, the hinge pillar portion 36, roof rail portion 38 and body lock pillar portion 40, as shown in FIG. 4.  The U-shaped member may also comprise the right and left body lock pillars 48, 50 and the back light frame 46.  Reinforcement
members comprising the front cross car assembly 30, rocker panel 42, or rear wall 52 are separately formed and then are assembled to the spaced lowered ends of their respective U-shaped members to form a sub-assembly.
 The reinforcement member establishes the spread of the sub-assembly as measured between the pair of spaced lower ends.  The reinforcement member also establishes the spacing between the stamped metal reinforcement member to the top of the
U-shaped member.  In this way, the height of the vehicle may be established.
 The method of assembling a vehicle frame 10 may further comprise providing a first locating feature on a first U-shaped member.  A second U-shaped member that is laterally adjacent to the first U-shaped member has a second locating feature.  The
second locating surface feature is complimentary to the first locating surface feature.  The step of securing the sub-assemblies together further comprises joining adjacent subassemblies at the first and second locating features.  The step of securing
the sub-assembly, such as the hoop assemblies 18-24, together may further comprise interlocking first locating features of one sub-assembly with second locating features of another sub-assembly.  The U-shaped portion of the sub-assemblies are located in
at least two spatial axes by the first and second locating features.
 The method may further comprise forming a passenger compartment pan 16 that is assembled and secured to the vehicle sub-assemblies.  Two of the sub-assemblies may comprise a pair of side sub-assemblies, such as the right and left door frame hoop
assemblies 20 and 22.  The method may further comprise securing the side sub-assemblies relative to the passenger compartment pan 16 so that the top of the side sub-assemblies establish the height of the vehicle frame according to the location where the
side sub-assemblies are assembled to the compartment pan.
 The method may also further comprise assembling and joining a front sub-assembly to the passenger compartment pan.  The front sub-assembly is assembled to a pair of side assemblies by joining the locating surface features of the hoop assembly 18
to the roof rail portion 38.  The front sub-assembly is also secured to the front of the passenger compartment pan.
 The method may also include joining a rear sub-assembly, such as the rear hoop assembly 24 to the compartment pan 16.  The locating features of the rear sub-assembly are attached to complimentary surface features formed on the body lock pillar
portion 40 of the door frame hoop assemblies 20, 22.
