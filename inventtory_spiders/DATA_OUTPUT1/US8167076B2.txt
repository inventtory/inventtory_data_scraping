abstract: 
 A motor vehicle has an actuator device for raising a bonnet in an
     accident to minimize injury to a pedestrian. The actuator device has at
     least two actuators for raising the bonnet. A control unit activates
     actuators with a time delay. Alternatively, the actuators differ in
     power. The time delay between activating the actuators or the differing
     power of the actuators reduces vibration while raising the bonnet,
     thereby ensuring proper raising of the bonnet and enhancing protection to
     the pedestrian.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
 This application claims priority under 35 USC 119 to German Patent Application No. 10 2009 051 980.7 filed on Nov.  4, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The invention relates to a motor vehicle with an actuator device for raising a bonnet or hood in an accident, and particularly an accident with a pedestrian.  The invention also relates to a method for reducing consequences of an accident of a
pedestrian with a motor vehicle.
 2.  Description of the Related Art
 EP 2 025 565 A1 discloses a motor vehicle with an actuator device for raising a bonnet in an accident, such as an accident with a pedestrian.  The actuator device has two actuators arranged at lateral sides of a rear end of the bonnet.  A
swinging-up action or vibration when adjusting the bonnet is difficult to control and a smoothing unit preferably is arranged in a joint of the actuator.  The smoothing unit generates a counterforce during the adjustment of the bonnet, for example in an
accident, and thereby has a positive influence on the vibration behaviour of the bonnet.
 EP 1 712 426 A1 discloses a motor vehicle with an energy-absorbing body between an actuator and a lower side of the bonnet.  The energy-absorbing body has a positive influence on the vibration behaviour of the bonnet during the adjustment
operation.
 EP 1 818 224 A1 discloses a motor vehicle with an absorption element that damps possible vibrations occurring during adjustment of the bonnet.
 In general, it has been demonstrated in motor vehicles that a bonnet can swing up or vibrate during an adjustment in an accident in a manner so that a prescribed deformation distance cannot be ensured.
 An object of the invention is to provide a motor vehicle that addresses the above-described problems and enhances safety.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The invention relates to an automobile with a bonnet or hood that has an actuator device designed to rapidly raise the bonnet or hood during an accident.  The raised bonnet will have a greater deformation distance.  As a result, a pedestrian
should anticipate less severe injury upon impact with the bonnet.
 Actuator devices of this type customarily have at least two identical laterally spaced actuators that act simultaneously for raising the bonnet.  However, the actuators of the invention do not exert identical raising forces at the same time. 
Accordingly, the bonnet does not rise uniformly when the two actuators are activated.  Surprisingly, the use of actuators that are not identical or out of phase with one another has been found to significantly reduce vibrations.  As a result, the
actuator device ensures a predefined deformation distance and achieves a predictable mitigation of the accident consequences.
 The two actuators can be located at laterally spaced positions at the rear end of the bonnet with respect to the travel direction.  The left and right actuators may be structurally identical, but may act with a time delay that has a positive
influence on the vibration behavior of the bonnet.
 Alternatively, the actuators may be activated substantially simultaneously during an accident, but differ in power.  Accordingly, the left and right rear sides of the bonnet are raised at different speeds.  The difference in power and speeds of
the respective actuators also has been found to achieve the desired reduction in vibrations.
 The desired effect of the invention can be achieved whether the bonnet is adjusted at the rear and/or at the front.  Rather, the desired effect of the invention is based on having the activation timing or the activation power of the two
actuators offset to achieve a slight phase shift or offset in the adjustment positions of the actuators.
 The actuators can be triggered pyrotechnically or by a mechanical spring.  Actuators that are triggered pyrotechnically are smaller and lighter than mechanical spring actuators.  Additionally, explosive activation ensures a rapid raising of the
bonnet in an accident with a pedestrian.  By contrast, mechanical spring actuators permit purely mechanical triggering mechanisms that may be less susceptible to faults than an electronic activation device for igniting pyrotechnic charges in an actuator. Furthermore, mechanical spring actuators afford the great advantage of being able to be reset after triggering and do not require a complete interchange after being triggered.  Thus, mechanical spring actuators reduce costs for servicing or repair after
an accident.
 Further important features and advantages of the invention emerge from the following drawings and from the associated description.  Of course, the features mentioned above and those explained below can be used in the respectively stated
combination, in different combinations or on their own without departing from the scope of the invention.
 Preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the drawings and are explained in more detail in the description below, wherein the same reference numbers refer to the same, similar or functionally identical components.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
 FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a motor vehicle according to the invention with a raisable front bonnet.
 FIG. 2 schematically illustrates a method for reducing consequences of an accident.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 A motor vehicle 1 according to the invention is identified by the numeral 1 in FIG. 1.  The motor vehicle 1 has an actuator device 2 for raising a rear end of a bonnet 3 during an accident, including an accident with a pedestrian.  The actuator
device 2 has two actuators 4 and 5 for raising the bonnet 3.  A control unit 6 is provided for reducing a vibration behavior of the bonnet 3 during the raising operation and thereby reliably ensures that a predefined minimum amount of raising is
achieved.  The control unit 6 of a first embodiment activates the actuators 4, 5 in an accident with a time delay and thereby prevents uniform raising of the bonnet 3.  The two actuators 4, 5 of the first embodiment may be of identical construction. 
However, the two actuators 4, 5 of a second embodiment may have different power.  The differently powered actuators 4, 5 of the second embodiment will cause opposite sides of the rear end of the bonnet 3 to be raised at differing speeds even if the
actuators are activated simultaneously by the control unit 6.  The differently powered actuators 4, 5 similarly reduce the tendency of the bonnet 3 to vibrate during opening, and therefore reliably ensure that the bonnet reaches the required minimum
amount of raising.
 Two actuators 4, 5 are illustrated in FIG. 1.  However, three or more actuators can be provided and each of the three or more actuators can differ in strength or can be triggered with a time delay.
 The actuators 4, 5, can have a pyrotechnic, i.e. ignitable, charge or a mechanical spring as triggering mechanism.  The pyrotechnic charges afford the great advantage of having a comparatively low weight, which is of great advantage particularly
in the manufacturing of sports cars.  By contrast, a mechanical spring permits the actuators to be reset after use, thus enabling the servicing and repair costs after an accident to be reduced.
 The control unit 6 can activate the actuators 4, 5 in an accident with a time delay and can thereby raise the bonnet 3 with little vibration.  Alternatively, the two actuators 4, 5 may be activated at the same time, but the actuators 4, 5 differ
in power to reduce vibrations.  In this second embodiment, the actuators 4, 5 may have pyrotechnic charges of differing power or springs of differing power.
 The bonnet 3 in FIG. 1 is raised at the rear end, as seen in the direction of travel.  The raised bonnet 3 defines an elastically flexible element that has a damping effect and can significantly reduce the consequences of an accident for
pedestrians.  The raised bonnet 3 significantly reduces the risk of severe head injuries for pedestrians.
 The actuators 4, 5 also may be at least slightly simulated in a triggered state for at least partially absorbing the impact energy of a pedestrian acting on the bonnet 3.  More, particularly, FIG. 2 illustrates a method for reducing consequences
of an accident of a pedestrian with a motor vehicle.  Method step A in FIG. 2 employs a sensor device to detect an approaching impact.  Method step B utilizes the control unit, 6 to activate the two actuators 4, 5 of the actuator device 2.  In this case,
the arrows illustrated between the individual actuators 4 and 5 and method step B differ in length to illustrate a time-delayed triggering of the actuators 4, 5.  More particularly, the actuator 4 in FIG. 2 is activated before the actuator 5 by a
selected time delay.  In method step C, the two actuators 4, 5 have finished the work of raising the bonnet 3 and provide an effective protection system for pedestrians to reduce the consequences of an accident.
 Actuators 4, 5 that differ in power may be used in FIG. 2 and may be activated at the same time in method step B because the differing power of the actuators 4, 5 results in a non uniform raising of the bonnet 3.
 The two alternate embodiments permit the bonnet 3 to be raised with low vibration so that the bonnet can reliably and safely reaches a predefined minimum amount of raising.  Ensuring the amount of raising of the bonnet 3 substantially reduces
the consequences of an accident of pedestrians with motor vehicles.
