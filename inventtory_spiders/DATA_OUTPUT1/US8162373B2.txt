groove 150.
 For consistency and convenience, directional adjectives are employed throughout this detailed description corresponding to the illustrated embodiments.  These directional adjectives may be used with respect to one or more components of a
mounting system including, for example, a covering member.  The term "longitudinal" as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims refers to a direction extending a length of component.  Also, the term "lateral" as used throughout this
detailed description and in the claims refers to a direction extending a width of a component.  Furthermore, the term "vertical" as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims refers to a direction generally perpendicular to a lateral and
longitudinal direction.  It should be understood that the terms longitudinal, lateral and vertical may also be applied to any components discussed in this detailed description including a sliding rail, a covering member, a mounting foot member as well as
any other component.
 Covering member 160 can include covering portion 162.  Generally, covering portion 162 can have a size and shape that corresponds to rearward portion 152 of recessed groove 150.  In particular, covering portion 162 can have width W1 that is
slightly larger than width W2 of recessed groove 150.  By using a slightly larger width for covering portion 162, covering portion 162 can be configured to rest on the edge of recessed groove 150.  Covering portion 162 can also have a length that is
configured to substantially cover any exposed portions of rearward portion 152 of recessed groove 150 once mounting system 108 has been fully assembled.
 In some cases, covering member 160 can also include attachment portion 161 disposed adjacent to covering portion 162.  In the exemplary embodiment, attachment portion 161 includes first upwardly extending portion 172 and second upwardly
extending portion 174 that may be associated with a sliding rail of a mounting system.  In some cases, first upwardly extending portion 172 and second upwardly extending portion 174 can be shaped in a manner to wrap around sidewalls of lower rail 122. 
In particular, first upwardly extending portion 172 can include first laterally directed portion 177 and second upwardly extending portion 174 can include second laterally directed portion 179.  In an exemplary embodiment, first laterally directed

 In some embodiments, a covering member can include provisions for attaching to a sliding rail.  In some cases, one or more upwardly extending portions can be configured with one or more fasteners for attaching to a portion of a sliding rail.  In
an exemplary embodiment, each upwardly extending portion can include a tab-like fastener that is configured to engage with, and fasten to, a portion of a sliding rail.
 FIG. 4 illustrates a plan view of an exemplary embodiment of covering member 160 attached to first sliding rail 110.  Referring to FIG. 4, first upwardly extending portion 172 can include first fastening member 202.  Generally, first fastening
member 202 can be any type of fastener configured to engage with lower rail 122.  In some cases, first fastening member 202 may be a tab-like fastener that is configured to wrap around first sidewall 212 of lower rail 122.  In a similar manner, second
upwardly extending portion 174 can include second fastening member 204.  In particular, second fastening member 204 may be a similar tab-like fastener that is configured to wrap around second sidewall 214 of lower rail 122.  With this arrangement, first
upwardly extending portion 172 and second upwardly extending portion 174 can be fastened directly to opposing sides of lower rail 122 of first sliding rail 110.
 Referring back to FIG. 3, attachment portion 161 may include first longitudinally extending portion 192 and second longitudinally extending portion 194 that are disposed opposite of covering portion 162.  In particular, first longitudinally
extending portion 192 may extend from first upwardly extending portion 172, while second longitudinally extending portion 194 may extend from second upwardly extending portion 174.  In some cases, first longitudinally extending portion 192 may be
substantially perpendicular to first upwardly extending portion 172.  Likewise, second longitudinally extending portion 194 may be substantially perpendicular to second upwardly extending portion 174.
 In some embodiments, a covering member can include provisions for attaching to a mounting foot member.  In some cases, one or more longitudinally extending portions can be configured with one or more fasteners for attaching to a portion of a
sliding rail.  In an exemplary embodiment, each longitudinally extending portion can include a tab-like fastener that is configured to engage with, and fasten to, a portion of a mounting foot member.
 FIG. 5 illustrates an assembled view of an exemplary embodiment of mounting system 108 from underneath mounting foot member 130, which is shown in phantom for purposes of illustration.  In some embodiments, covering member 160 can include third
fastening member 206 and fourth fastening member 208 that are disposed on first longitudinally extending portion 192 and second longitudinally extending portion 194, respectively.  Generally, third fastening member 206 and fourth fastening member 208 can
be any type of fasteners configured to engage a mounting foot member.  In an exemplary embodiment, third fastening member 206 and fourth fastening member 208 can be tab-like fasteners that are configured to engage with mounting foot member 130.
 As illustrated in FIG. 5, third fastening member 206 and fourth fastening member 208 may be configured to fasten to lower surface 220 of first portion 132 of mounting foot member 130.  In particular, third fastening member 206 and fourth
fastening member 208 may be configured to engage first lower lip 222 and second lower lip 224 of lower lip portion 133, respectively.  In other words, third fastening member 206 and fourth fastening member 208 are configured to engage opposing sides of
first portion 132 of mounting foot member 130.  With this arrangement, covering member 160 may be prevented from lifting up in a substantially vertical direction.
 In some cases, covering portion 162 can also include provisions for associating with mounting foot member 130.  In one embodiment, covering portion 162 can include mounting pin 199.  In some cases, mounting pin 199 may be configured to insert
into hole 197 disposed on second portion 134 of mounting foot member 130.  In some embodiments, mounting pin 199 may function as an alignment feature.  In other embodiments, however, mounting pin 199 may assist in fastening covering portion 162 to
mounting foot member 130.
 A covering member can include provisions for maintaining clearance between a covering portion of the covering member and an upper rail that may be configured to slide above the covering portion, especially in embodiments where a mounting foot
member is disposed below floor level.  In some cases, a covering member can have a shape that helps maintain consistent spacing between the covering portion and the upper rail.  In an exemplary embodiment, a covering member may include a recessed central
portion to provide substantial spacing between the covering portion and an upper rail that moves above the covering portion.
 Referring now to FIG. 6, covering portion 162 can have a concave, or recessed, shape to provide increased clearance between covering member 160 and first sliding rail 110, as illustrated in FIG. 2.  As illustrated in an enlarged cross sectional
view in FIG. 6, covering portion 162 includes central portion 164 and peripheral portion 166, which extends outwards from central portion 164.
 In some cases, central portion 164 may be configured to slope downwards from first end portion 180 of covering portion 162 to intermediate portion 183 of covering portion 162.  In addition, central portion 164 may slope upwards from intermediate
portion 183 to second end portion 182 of covering portion 162.  In other words, the depth of central portion 164 with respect to peripheral portion 166 increases from first end portion 180 to intermediate portion 183.  Also, the depth of central portion
164 increases from second end portion 182 to intermediate portion 183.  With this arrangement, central portion 164 may be recessed to provide clearance between covering portion 162 and upper rail 120.
 As seen in FIG. 6, peripheral portion 166 includes interior peripheral wall 167 that joins with central portion 164.  In addition, peripheral portion 166 includes upper peripheral portion 168 that is raised with respect to central portion 164. 
Also, peripheral portion 166 includes exterior peripheral wall 169 that extends below central portion 164.  In some cases, this arrangement provides a U-like shape for peripheral portion 166.  In an exemplary embodiment, exterior peripheral wall 169 may
have a substantially constant height to provide a regular, or flat, contact surface that engages the edges of a recessed groove.
 FIG. 7 is a cross sectional view of an exemplary embodiment of a portion of mounting system 108.  Referring to FIG. 7, the shape of covering portion 162 can help facilitate increased clearance between covering member 160 and upper rail 120.  In
this embodiment, upper rail 120 is disposed in an extended position.  Because first sliding rail 110 is mounted in recessed groove 150, upper rail 120 may be slightly angled so that rearward end 121 of upper rail 120 is tilted downwards.
 In an exemplary embodiment, the recessed shape of central portion 164 of covering portion 162 is configured to provide substantially consistent clearance between upper rail 120 and central portion 164.  In particular, intermediate portion 402 of
upper rail 120 is separated from central portion 164 of covering portion 162 by distance L1.  Likewise, rearward end 121 of upper rail 120 is separated from central portion 164 of covering portion 162 by distance L2.  In some embodiments, distance L1 and
distance L2 could have different values.  In an exemplary embodiment, distance L1 and distance L2 are substantially similar even though rearward end 121 is lower than intermediate portion 402, since central portion 164 also slopes downwardly from first
end portion 180 to second end portion 182.  In one embodiment, distance L1 and distance L2 may both be approximately 10 millimeters.  In other embodiments, however, these distances can vary.  With this arrangement, covering portion 162 is prevented from
interfering with upper rail 120 as upper rail 120 slides backwards and forwards with respect to floor portion 105.
 In this embodiment, covering portion 162 is disposed between upper rail 120 and mounting foot member 130.  It will be understood that while central portion 164 may slope downwardly, covering portion 162 can still be configured to maintain
clearance between central portion 164 and fastener 135.  In an exemplary embodiment, for example, fastener 135 is disposed adjacent to first end portion 180 of covering portion 162, which is higher than second end portion 182 in a substantially vertical
direction.  In this case, fastener 135 is separated from central portion 164 by distance L3.  In an exemplary embodiment, distance L3 may be approximately 3.8 millimeters.  However, in other embodiments, the value of distance L3 can vary.
 In different embodiments, the shape of a covering member can vary according to various factors.  For example, in some embodiments, the shape of a covering member can be different according to the region of a motor vehicle in which the covering
member will be installed.  In some cases, mounting systems for a driver seat may be slightly different than mounting systems for a passenger seat.  In order to accommodate differences in these mounting systems, a covering member associated with a driver
seat may be different from a covering member associated with a passenger seat.
 Referring back to FIG. 1, passenger side 104 of interior portion 100 may be associated with first covering member 191 and second covering member 193.  In some cases, first covering member 191 and second covering member 193 may be configured to
cover mounting feet members associated with a passenger seat.  For purposes of illustration, only first covering member 191 and second covering member 193 are shown.
 FIG. 8 illustrates an isometric view of an exemplary embodiment of first covering member 191.  It will be understood that in some embodiments, the shape, size and overall design of first covering member 191 may be substantially similar to the
shape, size and overall design of second covering member 193, as illustrated in FIG. 1.  In other embodiments, however, some characteristics may vary between first covering member 191 and second covering member 193.
 First covering member 191 may include covering portion 802 and attachment portion 804.  In some embodiments, attachment portion 804 can include provisions for attaching to a sliding rail.  In the exemplary embodiment, attachment portion 804
includes first upwardly extending portion 872 and second upwardly extending portion 874 that may be associated with a sliding rail of a mounting system.  In some cases, first upwardly extending portion 872 and second upwardly extending portion 874 can be
shaped in a manner to wrap around sidewalls of a lower rail.  Furthermore, first upwardly extending portion 872 and second upwardly extending portion 874 can be spaced apart by opening 876 that provides clearance for an upper rail to extend through.
 In some cases, first upwardly extending portion 872 and second upwardly extending portion 874 can be provided with first fastening member 882 and second fastening member 885, respectively.  It will be understood that these fastening members can
be configured to engage opposing side walls of a lower rail in a similar manner to the covering member of the previous embodiment.
 In contrast to the previous embodiment, however, attachment portion 804 may not include longitudinally extending portions.  Instead, first upwardly extending portion 872 and second upwardly extending portion 874 are disposed on an end portion of
first covering member 191 disposed opposite of covering portion 802.
 A covering member can include provisions for attaching to a mounting foot member.  In some embodiments, first covering member 191 can be provided with mounting pin 899 disposed on covering portion 802.  In some cases, mounting pin 899 may be
configured to engage a hole in a mounting foot member.  Mounting pin 899 may serve as a locating feature, a fastening feature, or both, in some cases.
 Covering portion 802 can have a concave, or recessed, shape to provide increased clearance between first covering member 191 and a sliding rail.  In some cases, covering portion 802 includes central portion 864 and peripheral portion 866. 
Central portion 864 may be configured to slope downwards from first end portion 880 of covering portion 802 to intermediate portion 884 of covering portion 802.  Then, central portion 864 may slope upwards from intermediate portion 884 to second end
portion 883 of covering portion 802.  In other words, the depth of central portion 864 with respect to peripheral portion 866 varies from first end portion 880 to second end portion 883.  Furthermore, the deepest portion of central portion 864 occurs at
intermediate portion 884, which may be disposed closer to second end portion 883 in some embodiments.
 As seen in FIG. 8, peripheral portion 866 includes interior peripheral wall 867 that joins with central portion 864.  In addition, peripheral portion 866 includes upper peripheral portion 868 that is raised with respect to central portion 864. 
Also, peripheral portion 866 includes exterior peripheral wall 869.  In some cases, exterior peripheral wall 869 may extend below central portion 864.  In other cases, however, exterior peripheral wall 869 may be disposed higher in a vertical direction
than central portion 864.  In an exemplary embodiment, exterior peripheral wall 869 may have a consistent vertical height in order to maintain a consistent outer edge for covering portion 802 to engage with a recessed groove.
 FIG. 9 is a cross sectional view of an exemplary embodiment of a portion of mounting system 900 associated with seat 902 of a motor vehicle.  In some cases, seat 902 could be a passenger seat.  In this embodiment, mounting system 900 for seat
902 includes sliding rail 910, which further comprises upper rail 920 and lower rail 922.  Furthermore, lower rail 922 is mounted to floor portion 903.  In particular, lower rail 922 is mounted within groove 905 of floor portion 903.
 In some cases, lower rail 922 may be mounted to floor portion 903 via mounting foot member 930, which may be substantially similar to mounting foot member 130 discussed above.  In some cases, mounting foot member 930 may be fastened to floor
portion 903 using fastener 933.  Also, mounting foot member 930 may be fastened to floor portion 903 using additional fasteners (not shown).
 Covering portion 802 can include provisions for associating with mounting foot member 930.  As previously discussed, covering portion 802 can include mounting pin 899.  In some cases, mounting pin 899 may be configured to insert into a hole of
mounting foot member 930.  In addition, first fastening member 882 and second fastening member 885 (see FIG. 8) may be configured to attach to lower rail 922 in a similar manner to the arrangement described for covering member 160.
 Referring to FIG. 9, the shape of covering portion 802 can help facilitate increased clearance between first covering member 191 and upper rail 920.  In this embodiment, upper rail 920 is disposed in an extended position.  Because sliding rail
910 is mounted in groove 905, upper rail 920 may be slightly angled so that rearward end 921 of upper rail 920 is tilted downwards.
 In an exemplary embodiment, the recessed shape of central portion 864 of covering portion 802 is configured to provide substantially consistent clearance between upper rail 920 and central portion 864.  In particular, intermediate portion 984 of
upper rail 920 is separated from central portion 864 of covering portion 802 by distance L4.  Likewise, rearward end 921 of upper rail 920 is separated from central portion 864 of covering portion 802 by distance L5.  In some embodiments, distance L4 and
distance L5 could have different values.  In an exemplary embodiment, distance L4 and distance L5 are substantially similar even though rearward end 921 is lower than intermediate portion 984, since central portion 864 also slopes downwardly from first
end portion 880 to intermediate portion 884 (see FIG. 8).  In one embodiment, distance L4 and distance L5 may both be approximately 10 millimeters.  In other embodiments, however, these distances can vary.  With this arrangement, covering portion 802 is
prevented from interfering with upper rail 920 as upper rail 920 slides backwards and forwards with respect to floor portion 903.
 In this embodiment, sliding rail 910 is titled downwards at a slightly greater angle than sliding rail 110 discussed in the previous embodiment.  In some cases, the shape of first covering member 191 may accommodate this slightly steeper
arrangement of a sliding rail.  In particular, as previously discussed, central portion 864 of covering portion 802 may be substantially deeper than covering portion 162 of covering member 160.  In particular, the depth of first covering member 191 as
measured between intermediate portion 884 and second end portion 883 (see FIG. 8) is greater than the depth of covering member 160 as measured between intermediate portion 183 and second end portion 182 of covering portion 162 (see FIG. 6).  With this
arrangement, first covering member 191 may provide adequate clearance for sliding rail 910, which is angled more than sliding rail 110.
 Generally, the shape of a covering portion can be varied in any manner.  In different embodiments, the depth, length and width can all be modified.  For example, the depth of the central portion can vary in any manner.  Although the current
embodiments include covering portions whose depths gradually increase from an end portion towards an intermediate portion, other embodiments can include depths that vary in other manners.  By modifying the shape of a covering portion, a covering member
can be configured to accommodate differences in a mounting configuration, including, but not limited to, differences in rail sizes, rail heights, rail angles, mounting foot shapes, mounting foot sizes, recessed groove shapes and sizes, as well as any
other features of a mounting system.
 In an exemplary embodiment, covering member 160 may be associated with a driver seat, while first covering member 191 may be associated with a passenger seat.  In particular, the distinctions in shapes and structural features of each covering
member may be useful for covering different types of rail configurations, floor cavities, and other features of a seat mounting system.  In other embodiments, however, covering member 160 could be associated with any seat of a motor vehicle, including a
passenger seat.  Likewise, first covering member 191 could be associated with any seat of a motor vehicle, including a driver seat.
 The covering members discussed in these embodiments can be manufactured in any manner known in the art.  In one embodiment, for example, a covering member can be formed using a molding technique.  In addition, a covering member can be made of
any material including, but not limited to, plastic, rubber, wood, metal, as well as any other material or combination of materials.  In some cases, the materials used for making a covering member can be selected according to the desired durability
properties of the covering member.
 While various embodiments of the invention have been described, the description is intended to be exemplary, rather than limiting and it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are
possible that are within the scope of the invention.  Accordingly, the invention is not to be restricted except in light of the attached claims and their equivalents.  Also, various modifications and changes may be made within the scope of the attached
claims.
