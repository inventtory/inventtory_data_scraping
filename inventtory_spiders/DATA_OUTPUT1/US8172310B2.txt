patent_description: 
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention relates to off-road vehicles, and more specifically to off-road vehicles having a cargo box.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Some off-road vehicles, such as recreational utility vehicles (RUVs) and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), are provided with a cargo box at the rear thereof.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,659,566, issued Dec.  9, 2003, illustrates and describes one such
off-road vehicle.  The addition of a cargo box to an off-road vehicle advantageously adds cargo space.  However, once the cargo box is filled with soil or wood, for example, it becomes inconvenient to place the tools used to get the soil or wood (i.e. a
shovel, an axe, or a chainsaw as the case may be) in the cargo box.  This is because there may be no more room in the cargo box and/or portions of the tools which should preferably remain clean (i.e. handles, motor .  . . ) would get dirty.  In such
cases, once the cargo box is filled, the tools usually need to be attached to a cargo rack on the off-road vehicle, which is less convenient than using the cargo box.
 Therefore, there is a need for an off-road vehicle having a cargo box which addresses at least some of these inconveniences.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 It is an object of the present invention to ameliorate at least some of the inconveniences present in the prior art.
 It is also an object of the present invention to provide an off-road vehicle having a dual floor cargo box.
 It is another object of the present invention to provide an off-road vehicle having a cargo box with two cargo spaces.
 In one aspect, the invention provides an off-road vehicle having a frame, at least four wheels suspended from the frame, each of the at least four wheels including a tire, a seat mounted on the frame, a steering assembly disposed forwardly of
the seat and being operatively connected to at least two of the at least four wheels, an engine mounted to the frame and being operatively connected to at least two of the at least four wheels, and a cargo box pivotally mounted to the frame rearwardly of
the seat.  The cargo box includes a cargo box body having a front wall, a pair of side walls extending from the front wall, a first floor connected to a lower end of the front and the pair of side walls, and an at least partially opened rear side.  A
second floor is selectively supported inside the cargo box body above the first floor.  The second floor when supported above the first floor divides the opened rear side of the cargo box body between a first opened portion extending from the first floor
to the second floor and a second opened portion extending from the second floor to an upper end of the side walls.  At least one tailgate selectively closes at least one of the first and second opened portions.
 In an additional aspect, each side wall defines a step extending towards the other side wall.
 In a further aspect, the second floor is selectively supported above the first floor at least in part by the steps.
 In an additional aspect, the second floor is selectively supported adjacent the front wall and the pair of side walls.
 In a further aspect, the second floor is pivotable relative to the cargo box body.
 In an additional aspect, the second floor is removable from the cargo box body.
 In a further aspect, the at least one tailgate is a single tailgate selectively closing at least in part both the first and second opened portions.
 In an additional aspect, the single tailgate is pivotally connected to the first floor.
 In a further aspect, the at least one tailgate includes a first tailgate and a second tailgate.  The first tailgate selectively closes the first opened portion.  The second tailgate selectively closes at least in part the second opened portion.
 In an additional aspect, the first tailgate is pivotally connected to the first floor.
 In a further aspect, the second tailgate is pivotally connected to an upper end of the first tailgate.
 In an additional aspect, each side wall defines a step extending towards the other side wall, and the second tailgate is pivotally connected to the steps.
 In a further aspect, the second tailgate is selectively connected to the side walls.
 In an additional aspect, the seat includes a seat base and a backrest, and the steering assembly includes a steering wheel.
 In a further aspect, the seat is a first seat, and a second seat is connected to the frame at a position laterally beside the first seat.  The second seat has a seat base and a backrest.
 In an additional aspect, the seat is a straddle seat, and the steering assembly includes a handlebar.
 In another aspect, the invention provides an off-road vehicle having a frame, at least four wheels suspended from the frame, each of the at least four wheels including a tire, a seat mounted on the frame, a steering assembly disposed forwardly
of the seat and being operatively connected to at least two of the at least four wheels, an engine mounted to the frame and being operatively connected to at least two of the at least four wheels, and a cargo box pivotally mounted to the frame rearwardly
of the seat.  The cargo box includes a cargo box body having a front wall, a pair of side walls extending from the front wall, a first floor connected to a lower end of the front and the pair of side walls, and an at least partially opened rear side.  A
second floor is supported inside the cargo box body above the first floor.  At least one tailgate selectively closes the at least partially opened rear side.  A first cargo space is defined at least in part between the front wall, the pair of side walls,
the first floor, the second floor, and the at least one tailgate when the at least one tailgate closes the at least partially opened rear side.  A second cargo space is defined at least in part between the front wall, the pair of side walls, the second
floor, and the at least one tailgate when the at least one tailgate closes the at least partially opened rear side.
 In an additional aspect, the second floor is removable from the cargo box body, such that when the second floor is removed the first cargo space communicates with the second cargo space.
 In a further aspect, the at least one tailgate is pivotally connected to the first floor.
 In an additional aspect, the at least partially opened rear side includes a first opened portion and a second opened portion.  The at least one tailgate includes a first tailgate selectively closing the first opened portion and a second tailgate
selectively closing at least in part the second opened portion.  The first cargo space is defined at least in part between the front wall, the pair of side walls, the first floor, the second floor, and the first tailgate when the first tailgate closes
the first opened portion.  The second cargo space is defined at least in part between the front wall, the pair of side walls, the second floor, and the second tailgate when the second tailgate closes the second opened portion.
 For purposes of this application the term "off-road vehicle" refers to a vehicle which is typically used off paved surfaces such as a recreational utility vehicle (RUV) or an all-terrain vehicle (ATV).  It should be understood that off-road
vehicles could be used on paved surfaces, however they are specifically designed for off paved surfaces riding.  An ATV refers to a wheeled vehicle designed for off-road use that travels on low pressure tires and has straddle seat.  An RUV refers to an
"opened" wheeled vehicle (contrary to a pickup truck which is a "closed" vehicle due to its closed passenger cabin) designed for off-road use which usually has side-by-side seating.  Also, terms related to spatial orientation such as forwardly,
rearwardly, left, and right, are as they would normally be understood by a driver of the vehicle sitting thereon in a normal driving position.
 Embodiments of the present invention each have at least one of the above-mentioned objects and/or aspects, but do not necessarily have all of them.  It should be understood that some aspects of the present invention that have resulted from
attempting to attain the above-mentioned objects may not satisfy these objects and/or may satisfy other objects not specifically recited herein.
 Additional and/or alternative features, aspects, and advantages of embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE

 FIG. 1 illustrates an ATV 10.  The ATV 10 has a frame 12 to which a vehicle body 14 is mounted.  Four wheels 16 are suspended from the frame 12 via suspension elements 18.  Each of the four wheels 16 has a tire 20.  It is contemplated that the
ATV 10 could have six or more wheels 16.  A straddle seat 22 is mounted on the frame 12 to accommodate at least a driver of the ATV 10.  A steering assembly including a handlebar 24 is disposed forwardly of the straddle seat 22.  The steering assembly is
operatively connected to the two front wheels 16 to permit steering of the ATV 10.  An engine 26, shown schematically in FIG. 1, is mounted to the frame 12 below the straddle seat 22.  The engine 26 is operatively connected to the four wheels 16 to power
the ATV 10.  It is contemplated that the engine 26 could be operatively connected to only two of the wheels 16.  A cargo box 28 is pivotally mounted to the frame 12 rearwardly of the straddle seat 22.  The ATV 10 has other features and components common
to most ATVs such as footrests and cargo racks.  As it is believed that these features and components would be readily recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, further explanation and description of these components will not be provided herein. 
The cargo box 28 will not be described in detail since its features are the same as or are similar to the features of the cargo box 50 of the RUV 30 described in greater detail below.  It should therefore be understood the description of the cargo box 50
provided below also applies to the cargo box 28.
 FIGS. 2-10 illustrate an RUV 30.  The RUV 30 has a frame 32 to which a vehicle body 34 is mounted.  Four wheels 36 are suspended from the frame 32 via suspension elements (not shown).  Each of the four wheels 36 has a tire 38.  It is
contemplated that the RUV 30 could have six or more wheels 36.  As best seen in FIG. 3, a pair of seats 40, each having a seat base 41 and a backrest 42, are mounted laterally beside each other on the frame 32 to accommodate a driver and a passenger of
the RUV 30.  A cage 44 is connected to the frame 32 and is disposed around the area where the seats 40 are located.  A steering assembly including a steering wheel 46 is disposed forwardly of the driver seat 40.  The steering assembly is operatively
connected to the two front wheels 36 to permit steering of the RUV 30.  An engine 48, shown schematically in FIG. 3, is mounted to the frame 32 between the seats 40.  The engine 48 is operatively connected to the four wheels 36 to power the RUV 30.  It
is contemplated that the engine 48 could be operatively connected to only two of the wheels 36.  A cargo box 50 is pivotally mounted to the frame 32 rearwardly of the seats 40.  The RUV 30 has other features and components such as headlights and handles. As it is believed that these features and components would be readily recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, further explanation and description of these components will not be provided herein.
 The cargo box 50 will now be described in greater detail.  The cargo box 50 has a cargo box body 52.  As best seen in FIG. 9, the cargo box 52 body has a front wall 54, a pair of side walls 56 extending rearwardly from the front wall 54, a lower
floor 58 connected to a lower end of the front and the pair of side walls 54, 56, and an opened rear side.  As seen in FIGS. 2 and 10, a bracket 60 is connected to the lower floor 58.  The bracket 60 pivotally connects the cargo box 50 to the frame 32
such that the cargo box 50 can pivot from a generally horizontal position (shown in FIGS. 2-5, 7, and 8) to a pivoted position (shown in FIGS. 6, 9, and 10).  By pivoting the cargo box 50, the contents of the cargo box 50 can easily be dumped on the
ground.  A latch assembly (not shown) is used to lock the cargo box 50 in the horizontal position.  A user of the RUV 30 can release the latch assembly to allow the cargo box 50 to pivot.  It should be understood that many different types of latch could
be used.  One such latch assembly is shown and described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,659,566, issued Dec.  9, 2003, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.  An air shock 62 (FIG. 10) connects the cargo box body 52 to the frame 32 to prevent
the cargo box 50 from pivoting too quickly between the horizontal and the pivoted position.
 Each side wall 56 of the cargo box body 52 defines a step 64 which extends generally horizontally towards the other side wall 56.  This reduces the width of the lower portion of the cargo box body 52 such that it fits between the two rear wheels
36, thus allowing for a deeper cargo box body 52.  Each step 64 has a curved portion 66 such that when the rear wheels 36 travel up relative to the cargo box body 32 (due to the suspension), the rear wheels 36 do not come into contact with the steps 64. 
The front wall 54, side walls 56 (including steps 64), and lower floor 58 are preferably integrally formed and are preferably made of structural foam.  Alternatively, they could be made of plastic by using a rotomolding process.  It is contemplated that
other manufacturing processes could be used such as injection molding.  It is also contemplated that other materials could be used, such as sheet metal that could be bent and welded together to form the cargo box body 52.  It is also contemplated that
each portion of the cargo box body 52 could be made separately and then fastened to the other portions thereof.
 A lower tailgate 68 is pivotally connected about a generally horizontal axis to the lower floor 58 of the cargo box body 52 at the rear thereof.  The lower tailgate 68 selectively closes a portion of the opened rear side of the cargo box body 52
as described in greater detail below.  The lower tailgate 68 is pivotable between a closed position, as seen in FIGS. 2-7, and an opened position, as seen in FIGS. 8-10.  It is contemplated that the lower tailgate 68 could be removable from the cargo box
body 52.  A locking mechanism (not shown), such as latch, is used to lock the lower tailgate 68 in the closed position.  The lower tailgate 68 is preferably made of structural foam.  Alternatively, it could be made of plastic using a rotomolding process. It should be understood that, as with the cargo box 52, other materials and manufacturing processes could be used.
 An upper tailgate 70 is pivotally connected about a generally horizontal axis to the steps 64 of the side wall 56 of the cargo box body 52 at the rear thereof.  The upper tailgate 70 selectively closes a portion of the opened rear side of the
cargo box body 52 as described in greater detail below.  The upper tailgate 70 is pivotable between a closed position, as seen in FIGS. 2-6, and 8, and an opened position, as seen in FIGS. 7 and 10.  As seen in FIG. 9, the upper tailgate 70 can also be
removed from the cargo box body 52.  A locking mechanism (not shown), such as a latch, is used to lock the upper tailgate 70 in the closed position.  The upper tailgate 70 is preferably made of structural foam.  Alternatively, it could be made of plastic
using a rotomolding process.  It should be understood that, as with the cargo box 52, other materials and manufacturing processes could be used.
 As can be seen in FIGS. 7, 8, and 10, the lower and upper tailgates 68, 70 can be opened independently from each other (FIGS. 7 and 8) or at the same time (FIG. 10).  In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 11, a RUV 30' has a cargo box 50'
which has an upper tailgate 70' pivotally connected to an upper end of a lower tailgate 68' about a generally horizontal axis.  In this embodiment, the upper tailgate 70' can be opened independently of the lower tailgate 68', however the lower tailgate
68' can only be opened together with the upper tailgate 70'.  In another alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 12, a RUV 30'' has a cargo box 50'' which has a single tailgate 68'' pivotally connected to the lower floor 58.  In another alternative
embodiment shown in FIG. 13, a cargo box 50''' has lower tailgate 68''' and an upper tailgate 70''' which are pivotally connected to the cargo box body 52 about their upper ends.  It is contemplated that the lower tailgate 68''' and the upper tailgate
70''' could be selectively pivotally connected to the cargo box body 52 about either their upper ends or their lower ends to match a user's preference.  For simplicity, the components of the RUVs 30' and 30'' which are similar to the components of the
RUV 30 described above and the components of the cargo boxes 50', 50'', and 50''' which are similar to the components of the cargo box 50 described above have been given the same reference numerals and will not be described in detail herein.
 Returning to FIGS. 3-8, it can be seen that an upper floor 72 is selectively supported in the cargo box body 52 above the lower floor 58 adjacent the front wall 54 and the pair of side walls 56.  It is contemplated that the upper floor could not
extend up to the front wall 54 and the pair of side walls 56.  When the upper floor 72 is installed in the cargo box body 52, the sides thereof are supported by the steps 64 of the side walls 56 such that the upper floor 72 is relatively levelled with
the steps 64.  As best seen in FIG. 8 (and also FIGS. 11 and 12 for the alternative embodiments), the upper floor 72 divides the opened rear side of the cargo box body 52 between a lower opened portion and an upper opened portion.  The lower opened
portion extends from the lower floor 58 to the upper floor 72 and is selectively closed by the lower tailgate 68, thereby defining a lower cargo space.  The upper opened portion extends from the upper floor 72 to the upper end of the side walls 56 and is
selectively closed by the upper tailgate 70, thereby defining an upper cargo space.  It is contemplated that the upper tailgate 70 could not extend all the way up to the upper end of the side walls 56 when it is closed.  In the cargo box 50' of FIG. 11,
the lower and upper tailgates 68' and 70' selectively close the lower and upper opened portions respectively as in the cargo box 50.  As with upper tailgate 70, it is contemplated that the upper tailgate 70' could not extend all the way up to the upper
end of the side walls 56 when it is closed.  In the cargo box 50'' of FIG. 12, the single tailgate 68'' selectively closes both the lower and upper opened portions at the same time.  The single tailgate 68'' is provided with a door 74 in the lower
portion thereof which can be opened to access the lower cargo space without having to open the single tailgate 68''.  It is contemplated that the door 74 could pivot or slide relative to the single tailgate 68''.  As with upper tailgate 70, it is
contemplated that the single tailgate 68'' could not extend all the way up to the upper end of the side walls 56 when it is closed.  In the cargo box 50''' of FIG. 13, the lower and upper tailgates 68''' and 70''' selectively close the lower and upper
opened portions respectively as in the cargo box 50.
 By having the upper floor 72 disposed inside the cargo box body 52 above the lower floor 58 as shown, cargo can be stored inside the lower and upper cargo spaces separately.  For example, sand could be loaded on the upper floor 72 inside the
upper cargo space while the shovel used to load the sand could be placed on the lower floor 58 in the lower cargo space.  As seen in FIG. 5, the upper floor 72 can be pivoted upwardly relative to the cargo box body 52.  This allows the lower cargo space
to be easily accessed when there is no (or very little) cargo in the upper cargo space without having to open the lower tailgate 68.  As seen in FIG. 9, the upper floor 72 can also be removed from the cargo box body 52, thereby communicating the lower
and upper cargo spaces together, thus allowing the full volume of the cargo box body 52 to be used to load cargo.  In the alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 13, the upper floor 72''' is made of two sections 76 and 78 pivotally connected to each other. 
The forward end of the section 76 is pivotally connected to the front of the cargo box body 52.  The rearward end of the section 78 is slidably connected inside tracks 80 disposed on either sides thereof.  The sections 76, 78 can be disposed horizontally
to separate the lower cargo space from the upper cargo space.  From their horizontal position, the rearward end of the section 78 can be pushed toward the front wall 54 causing the section 78 to slide and pivot upwardly and the section 76 to pivot
upwardly as shown in FIG. 13, thereby communicating the lower and upper cargo spaces together.
 Modifications and improvements to the above-described embodiments of the present invention may become apparent to those skilled in the art.  The foregoing description is intended to be exemplary rather than limiting.  The scope of the present
invention is therefore intended to be limited solely by the scope of the appended claims.
