FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention relates to a trim panel assembly for a door of an automotive vehicle having multiple trim panels.  More particularly, the present invention relates to the structure of the trim panels which provide support during the heat
staking process.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 It is well known in the art to attach the individual trim panels of a trim panel assembly by a process known as staking.  In such a process, one of the parts to be joined has an aperture while the other part includes an elongated protrusion
sized to fit through the aperture.  Pressure is then applied to compress the protrusion radially forming an interference fit between the two parts.
 As the individual trim panels of a trim panel assembly are often formed of a molded plastic, a variation of the staking process known as thermoplastic or heat staking is used.  The heat staking process uses heat to soften the plastic protrusion
and pressure to compress the protrusion forming a head which mechanically locks the two panels together.
 As such, heat staking is a versatile process allowing the simultaneous formation of several heads by deforming several protrusions.  Trim panel assemblies which are composed of several individual trim panels are particularly well suited to the
heat staking process as the multitude of protrusions of the individual panels can be simultaneously deformed thereby assembling the trim panel assembly in one step.  However, trim panel assemblies often include overlapping trim panels which may or may
not require all of the overlapping panels to be attached.  In many instances the trim panel assembly only requires that the outer two overlapping panels be attached even though there is a third overlapping panel.
 As the heat staking process utilizes a weld horn to apply heat and then pressure to compress the softened protrusion, a weld horn backing plate is placed behind the panels to provide rigid support during the heat staking process.  However, if
only the two outer panels are to be attached and there is a third overlapping panel, it is the third overlapping panel which would contact the weld horn backing plate.  As such, the two outer panels to be attached are left unsupported.
 In such a circumstance it is known in the art to provide a support extending from the third overlapping panel which abuts one of the panels to be attached thereby providing support.  However, a problem arises when the distance between the third
overlapping panel and one of the panels to be attached extends beyond a certain point.  As the individual trim panels are formed of a molded plastic, extending the support to such a point will cause surface defects on the opposite side of the trim panel. This is unacceptable as the opposite surface of the third overlapping panel faces the interior passenger compartment of the automotive vehicle.
 Thus, there exists a need for an improved trim panel assembly having a structure capable of providing support during a heat staking process.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention provides an improved trim panel assembly which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the previously known trim panel assemblies which lack sufficient structural support for the heat staking process.
 In brief, a trim panel assembly which provides support during the heat staking attachment of an accessory panel between a weld horn and a weld horn backing plate is provided.  The trim panel assembly includes a first panel having an outer
surface and an inner surface, the outer surface having an outwardly extending support boss and the inner surface being adjacent to the weld horn backing plate.  A second panel has an outer surface which has an elongated stub aligned with an aperture
formed on the accessory panel such that the stub extends through the aperture.  An inner surface of the second panel includes an outwardly extending boss which contacts the support boss of the first panel.
 By providing support bosses on the first and the second panels, rather than having a boss extend from the first panel to contact the inner surface of the second panel the height of the support boss extending from the first panel is reduced.  As
such, support for the second panel during the heat staking process is provided while avoiding the formation of surface defects on the inner surface of the first panel.
 It is appreciated, that the inventive trim panel assembly is not limited to use in automotive vehicle doors, and can be utilized in any field or environment in which two interior panels are to be attached by a staking process, and a third panel
is positioned between the interior panels a rigid supports such as a weld horn backing plate. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION
 The present invention has utility as a trim panel assembly which provides support for the inner panels during the heat staking process even when the inner panels are overlapped by an outer panel.  By providing the first panel and the second
panel with corresponding supporting bosses, the second panel can be supported while avoiding the formation of surface defects on the outer surface of the first panel.
 With reference to FIG. 1, a door of an automotive vehicle is generally illustrated at 10.  A trim panel assembly 12 attaches to the door frame to cover the various door-related mechanisms including door handles, window controls, electronic
locking systems, and audio speaker assemblies.  The trim panel assembly 12 includes an outer trim panel 14 having an outer surface 16 which faces the interior passenger compartment of the automotive vehicle.  As such, the outer surface 16 includes a
stylized surface so as to provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance to the interior of the automotive vehicle.
 An interior panel 20 overlaps an inner surface 18 of the outer panel 14, as clearly seen in FIG. 2.  The interior panel 20 includes an outer surface 22 which faces the inner surface 18 of the outer panel 14 and an inner surface 24 which faces
the frame of the door 10.  An accessory panel 26, which in the illustrated embodiment is a speaker grate covering the speaker opening of the speaker assembly, overlaps the interior panel 20.  It is appreciated, of course, that the accessory panel is not
limited to a speaker grill, and may be any other type of panel having an aperture which is to be attached to the interior panel 20.
 The accessory panel 26 includes a number of attachment tabs 28 used to attach the interior panel 20 to the accessory panel 26.  With reference to FIG. 3, the tabs 28 of the supplementary panel 26 include an aperture 30.  The aperture 30 is
aligned relative to the interior panel 20 such that a deformable stud 32 extending from the inner surface 24 of the interior panel 20 passes therethrough so as to facilitate the heat staking process.  The stud 32 includes a base 34 having a plurality of
radially extending ribs 36 to accurately space the interior panel 20 a predetermined distance from the accessory panel 26.
 A boss 38 extends from the outer surface 22 of the interior panel 20 so as to contact a support boss 40 extending from the inner surface 18 of the outer panel 14.  In this manner the distance the support boss 40 is required to span is reduced by
the distance the boss 38 extends from the outer surface of the interior panel 20.  As such, the interior panel 20 can be supported by the outer panel 14 even if the distance between the interior panel 20 and the outer panel 14 would normally cause a
surface defect on the outer surface 16.
 In a preferred embodiment, the boss 38 has a circular cross section and the support boss 40 has a generally X-shaped cross section so as to provide sufficient contact points between the boss 38 and support boss 40.  It is appreciated, of course,
that the cross sections of the boss 38 and the support boss 40 may be reversed or that each of the bosses have other cross-sectional shapes illustratively including triangular, rectangular, or any other suitable cross section so as to provide sufficient
contact points between boss 38 and support boss 40.
 The relative position and interaction of the various trim panels during the heat staking process will now be discussed.  With reference to FIG. 5A, the outer panel 14 is placed adjacent to a weld horn backing plate such that the outer surface 16
contacts the weld horn backing plate 42.  The interior panel 20 is placed adjacent to the outer panel 14 such that the boss 38 is aligned with the support boss 40, and that the stud 32 extends through the aperture 30 of the accessory plate 26.  A welding
horn 44 applies heat to soften the stud 32 and then applies pressure in the longitudinal direction of the stud to mechanically attach the interior panel 20 to the accessory panel 26.
 Referring now to FIG. 5B, the pressure applied by the welding horn 44 deforms the stud 32 into a head cover 46 which extends radially beyond the width of aperture 30 thereby mechanically attaching the interior panel 20 to the accessory panel 26. As the welding horn 44 applies pressure to the stud 32, the boss 38 of the interior panel 20 contacts the support boss 40 of the outer panel 14 which abuts the welding horn backing plate 42 to support the interior panel 20.  As such, the outer panel 14
is sandwiched between the interior panel 20 and the weld horn backing plate 42 which allows the welding horn 44 to apply pressure to the stud 32 and consequently the interior panel 20 due to the contact between the support boss 40 and the boss 38.
 It will be appreciated, of course, that the present invention is not limited to use with a door trim panel or in conjunction with a motor vehicle.  The inventive trim panel assembly is capable of providing support during a staking process for
any sort or type of panels regardless of location.
 From the foregoing, it can be seen that the present invention provides a trim panel assembly having a support structure which allows the interior panels to be supported during a heat staking process even when overlapped by an outer panel. 
Having described the invention, however, many modifications thereto will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
