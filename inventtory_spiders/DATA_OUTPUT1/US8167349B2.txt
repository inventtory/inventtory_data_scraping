DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the present invention(s), examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described below.  While the invention(s) will be described in conjunction with exemplary
embodiments, it will be understood that present description is not intended to limit the invention(s) to those exemplary embodiments.  On the contrary, the invention(s) is/are intended to cover not only the exemplary embodiments, but also various
alternatives, modifications, equivalents and other embodiments, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
 An auto return structure of a luggage room screen according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is a technique, which makes it possible to perform auto return of the screen through improvement of a guide portion 200 that is
formed in a luggage side trim and an end portion 331 of a reinforcement board 330 of a screen device 300 that is movably installed in the guide portion 200.
 The auto return structure of a luggage room screen according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, includes the guide portion 200 formed on a luggage side trim 100 that is an inner wall surface of
a luggage room, and the screen device 300 which is installed across the luggage room in the left/right direction (in the vehicle width direction) of a vehicle body and is installed along the guide portion 200 if necessary in a state where a screen is
inserted into the guide portion 200.
 The guide portion 200 has a structure that makes the screen drawn out from the screen device 300 automatically returned, and includes a guide groove 210, a movement groove 220, and a locking protrusion 240.
 The guide groove 210 is to guide the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 toward the rear of the vehicle body, and is formed to connect to the luggage side trim 100 toward the rear of the vehicle body.  The end portion of the
reinforcement board is movably installed in the guide groove, and an end of the guide groove 210 is formed to be gradually inclined toward the lower part of the vehicle body.
 That is, the end portion of the guide groove 210 is formed to be bent toward the lower part of the vehicle body as being smoothly curved toward the rear of the vehicle body.
 The movement groove 220 is formed to extend from the upper and lower surfaces 212 and 214 of the guide groove 210 to an upper part of the vehicle body, and more particularly, to extend in the form of a semicircle toward the upper part of the
vehicle body.
 Here, on the lower connection portion of the movement groove 220 and the guide groove 210, a lower support portion 211 is formed to project in the inner direction (in the upper direction as seen in FIG. 3), and the lower support unit 211 is
positioned on the vertical line of the locking protrusion 240.
 The lower support portion 211 as described above locks the return of the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 that moves to the guide groove 210 along the movement groove 220, and thus safe operation is guided with the speed reduced.
 The locking protrusion 240 is formed to project to the upper connection portion of the guide groove 210 and the movement groove 220 in the rear direction (toward the rear of the vehicle body).
 Here, the locking projection 240 is formed to be downwardly inclined at a predetermined angle, and through this, the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 that is locked on the locking protrusion 240 is easily rotated to facilitate the
secession of the locking protrusion.
 On the other hand, on the upper connection portion of the movement groove 220 and the guide groove 210, an upper support portion 221 is formed to project in the inner direction (in the lower direction as seen in FIG. 3), and the upper support
unit 221 supports the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 that is moved to the movement groove 220, and makes the locking protrusion 240 and a locking groove 332 positioned substantially on the same line, and thus guides the end portion 331 of
the reinforcement board 330 to be inserted into the locking protrusion 240.
 In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the locking groove 332 may be formed by an upper leg 350 and a lower leg 355 wherein the locking groove 332 is disposed therebetween.
 The screen device 300, as illustrated in FIG. 2, is provided in the luggage room, and is installed across the luggage room in the left/right direction (in the vehicle width direction) of a vehicle body.  The screen device 300 includes a screen
housing 310 fixed to the luggage side trim 100, a screen 320 which is wound on a rotary roll in the screen housing 310 and is drawn through an outlet of the screen housing 310, and the reinforcement board 330 which is connected to the front end of the
screen 320 and the end portion of which is movably installed in the guide portion 200.
 The rotary roll has an elastic restoring force by a spring, and thus the screen 320 wound on the rotary roll is maintained unless an external force is applied thereto.
 Here, the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 includes a vertical surface and a curved surface in the form of a semicircle, and the locking groove 332 is formed on the vertical surface so that the locking protrusion 240 is inserted
into the locking groove 332.
 On the other hand, the interlocking groove 332 formed on the reinforcement board 330 and the locking protrusion 240 of the guide portion 200 are positioned to correspond to each other.
 The auto return structure of the luggage room screen as constructed above, as illustrated in FIG. 3, has an inclination angle a.degree.  of the locking protrusion 240, an inclination angle b.degree.  of the lower support portion 211 connected to
the guide groove 210, an inclination angle c.degree.  of the movement groove 220 connected to the lower support unit 211, and an inclination angle d.degree.  from the upper support portion 221 to the lower support portion 211 around the locking
protrusion 240 (where, a.degree.<b.degree.<c.degree.<d.degree.).
 That is, the inclination angle a.degree.  of the locking protrusion 240 is formed to be inclined downwardly from the ground, and the upper surface of the locking groove 332 is formed to be inclined at the same angle so that the upper surface of
the locking groove 332 becomes in close contact with the inclined angle a.degree.  of the locking protrusion 240.
 The inclination angle b.degree.  of the lower support portion 211 connected to the guide groove 210 is formed to be larger than the inclination angle a.degree.  of the locking protrusion 240, and thus the locking force of the end portion 331 of
the reinforcement board 330 is increased.
 Also, the inclination angle c.degree.  of the movement groove 220 connected to the lower support unit 211 is formed to be larger than the inclination angle b.degree.  of the lower support portion 221, and thus the end portion 331 of the
reinforcement board 330 is prevented from being caught in the groove.
 Also, the inclination angle d.degree.  from the upper support portion 221 to the lower support portion 211 around the locking protrusion 240 is formed to be larger than the inclination angle c.degree.  of the movement groove 220 connected to the
lower support unit 211.  Considering that the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 can secede from the locking protrusion 240 if the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 locked on the locking protrusion 240 is sufficiently rotated as
large as the inclination angle d.degree., the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 fixed to the locking protrusion 240 is prevented from seceding due to the self-movement.
 The operation of the auto return structure of a luggage room screen as constructed above will now be described with reference to FIG. 4.
 As illustrated in FIG. 4, if a user pulls the reinforcement board 330 toward the rear of the vehicle body in a state where the user holds the reinforcement board 330, the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 is moved to the movement
groove 220 along the guide groove 210.  At this time, the screen 320 is drawn out from the screen housing 310 along the reinforcement board 330 to finish the upper portion of the luggage room.
 Then, the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 is supported by the upper support portion 221, and the locking protrusion 240 is locked in the locking groove 332 of the reinforcement board 330.
 In particular, the upper leg 350 is coupled between the locking protrusion 240 and the upper support portion 221.  The mass center 340 of the end portion 331 is biased upward the mass center 245 of the locking protrusion 240, such that the end
portion 331 is biased upwards and thus the upper leg 350 is firmly coupled between the locking protrusion 240 and the upper support portion 221.
 Then, the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 is fixed to the locking protrusion in a locked state by the elastic restoring force acting on the screen that is wound on the rotary roll.
 Then, in the case of removing the screen 320 that has finished the upper portion of the luggage room, if the reinforcement board 330 is pressed, the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 331 is rotated in the lower direction around the
locking protrusion 240.  In this case, if the rotating angle of the end portion 331 becomes equal to or larger than the inclination angle d.degree., the center of gravity is changed, and the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 is automatically
moved along the guide portion 200 as indicated by dotted line in FIG. 4 to make the screen 320 drawn into the screen housing 310.
 In this case, if the end portion 331 of the reinforcement board 330 is moved from the movement groove 220 to the guide groove 210, the movement radius of the reinforcement board 330 is minimized as the end portion 331 is supported by the lower
support portion 221, and thus a prompt return can be guided.
 For convenience in explanation and accurate definition in the appended claims, the terms "upper", "lower", "inner", "outer", "front" and "rear" are used to describe features of the exemplary embodiments with reference to the positions of such
features as displayed in the figures.
 The foregoing descriptions of specific exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description.  They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms
disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings.  The exemplary embodiments were chosen and described in order to explain certain principles of the invention and their practical application, to
thereby enable others skilled in the art to make and utilize various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, as well as various alternatives and modifications thereof.  It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the Claims
appended hereto and their equivalents.
