 FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c) illustrate operation views for explaining that the clip provided on the side of the first member is fitted to the second member, showing that a predetermined portion of the door trim 16 or a portion of the clip 37 is pressed
in an arrow mark y direction by the press pad 54.
 FIG. 12(a) shows the clip 37 in the preparing step (notation 21 of FIG. 1) and the door trim 16 is made to face the door panel 18 in a state of being attached with a base portion 141 of the clip 37.
 FIGS. 12(b) and 12(c) show the clip 37 in the clip fitting step (notation 24 of FIG. 1), and by pressing the clip 37 provided on the side of the door trim 16 in the arrow mark y direction by the press pad 54, the clip 37 is fitted to the clip
hole 38 provided to the door panel 18.
 In FIG. 12(b), the clip 37 sharpens a front end portion 37a thereof, provided with a barrel portion 143 formed to be gradually bold rearward from the front end portion 37a, and provided with a fitting portion 144 fitted to the clip hole 38 at a
rear portion 37b thereof.  Therefore, by a pressing force by the press pad 54, in inserting the clip, the barrel portion 143 of the clip 37 is made to be elongatable and contractable in a direction substantially orthogonal to an inserting direction.
 In FIG. 12(c), the rear portion 37b of the clip 37 is provided with the fitting portion 144 for fitting the clip hole 38 and the clip 37.  Further, a boldness of the fitting portion 144 is normally smaller than a maximum boldness of the barrel
portion 143.
 When the first member 15 is further pressed in the direction of the arrow mark y by the press pad 54, fitting is finished by making the fitting portion 144 reach the clip hole 38 provided to the second member 17.
 At a moment at which the fitting portion 144 is fitted to the clip hole 38, the boldness of the fitting portion 144 is smaller than the maximum boldness of the barrel portion 143.  Therefore, the contracted barrel portion 143 is released to
return to a direction of an arrow mark z constituting the original position to thereby finish sitting.  The clip 37 includes a spacer element 220 positioned between the first member and the second member, as shown in FIG. 12(c).
 FIG. 13 is an operation explanatory diagram for explaining a change over time of the press reaction force when the clip is fitted to the clip hole, showing a characteristic of the press reaction force when a number of the clip is one.
 Curve G is a curve showing a characteristic of press reaction force when the clip (notation 37 of FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c)) is normally fitted to the clip hole (notation 38 of FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c)), and curve N is a curve showing a characteristic of
the press reaction force when the clip (notation 37 of FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c)) is not attached to the door trim (notation 16 of FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c)).
 With regard to curve G, at time t0, the press pad is brought into contact with the door trim 16 to start pressing, exerted with the press reaction force as a reaction force thereof to be detected by the reaction force detecting means, becomes f1
constituting a first peak value of the press reaction force at time t1, becomes f2 by reducing the press reaction force at time t2, becomes f3 constituting a second peak value of the press reaction force at time t3, becomes f4 by reducing the press
reaction force at time t4, and finally becomes f5 constituting a steady state value.  Further, the time period t0 through t4 is around 300 ms.
 A value (f1-f2) of reducing the reaction force brought about during a time period of t1 through t2 and a value (f3-f4) of reducing the reaction force brought about during a time period of t3 through t4 are respectively values brought about when
the fitting portion 144 of the clip 37 reaches the clip hole 38, and the reason of reducing the reaction force is that at a moment at which the inserting portion main body is brought into the clip hole and the fitting portion 144 reaches the clip hole 38
to be fitted therewith by pressing, the barrel portion 142 is released.  At this occasion, an accumulated value Xm of reducing the press reaction force becomes ((f1-f2)+(f3-f4)).
 With regard to curve N, when the clip 37 is not attached to the door trim 16, the press reaction force is continuously increased, and reaches the steady state value f5 with an elapse of time.  At this occasion, the reduction in the press
reaction force is null and the accumulated value of reducing the press reaction force is null.
 FIGS. 14(a) and 14(b) illustrate operation explanatory views for explaining changes over time of the press reaction force when the clip is not normally fitted to the second member.
 In FIG. 14(a), there is shown a characteristic of the press reaction force when the clip (notation 37 of FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c)) is deviatedly brought into the clip hole (notation 38 of FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c)).
 A reduction in the reaction force at al region of the drawing is caused by the fact that the barrel portion (notation 143 of FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c)) is brought into partial contact with the clip hole immediately after starting to insert the clip
into the clip hole.  In addition to the reduction in the reaction force, as shown by the preceding drawing, the reaction force when the clip is fitted to the fitting portion is added and therefore, in comparison with the accumulated value Xm of the
reduction in the press reaction force when normally fitted, an accumulated value Xa of the reduction in the press reaction force is increased.  Therefore, Xm<Xa.
 In FIG. 14(b), there is shown a characteristic of the press reaction force when the clip (notation 37 of FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c)) cannot be brought into the clip hole (notation 38 of FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c)) by being deviated therefrom.
 A reduction in the reaction force at b1 region of the drawing is caused by the fact that after the barrel portion 143 is brought into partial contact with the clip hole immediately after starting to insert the clip into the clip hole, the barrel
portion 143 is released.  Further, a reduction in the press reaction force is not observed at b2 region because the fitting portion (notation 144 of FIGS. 12(a) to 12(c)) does not reach the clip hole 38.  Therefore, in comparison with normal fitting, an
accumulated value Xb of the reduction in the press reaction force is reduced and Xb<Xm.
 Although an explanation has been given of the fact that the accumulated value for reduction in the press reaction force is changed by a failure in a position of setting the clip, the accumulated value of the reduction in the press reaction force
is significantly varied also by a failure in the clip per se, a difference in specification, a positional shift, a difference in a size of the clip hole or the like.
 Therefore, it can be determined whether the clip is correctly fitted (hereinafter, referred to also as acceptability of fitting) by a value of an accumulated value X by grasping the accumulated value X of the reduction in the press reaction
force in pressing by taking these factors into consideration.
 Specifically, the acceptability of fitting can be determined by setting an allowable range of accumulated value X of the reduction in the press reaction force to, for example, Xmin<X<Xmax.  That is, when X is a value smaller than Xmin, it
is determined that the clip is not correctly fitted, and when X is a value larger than Xmax, it is determined that the clip is not correctly fitted.
 Xmin and Xmax are values capable of being set by experiment and experience.
 Although an explanation has been given of the change over time of the press reaction force when the number of the clips is one in the drawings, in the embodiment, the number of the clip is eight.
 Hence, a specific explanation will be given of the number of the clips and position of pressing the clip by the press pad.
 Referring back to FIG. 2, notations 146a through 146d designate positions of pressing the door trim 16 by the left and right press pads 54L, 54R when the door trim 16 is integrated to the door panel 18.
 According to the exemplary embodiment, the number of clips corresponding to the single press pad per one time pressing is two and the press reaction forces are detected by two times pressing operation of the respective press pads.
 The left and right clips are simultaneously pressed by a way of thinking similar to that in a case in which when the number of the clip is one, a vicinity of the clip is pressed by the press pad attached to the front end of the articulated
robot, and the acceptability of fitting the clips can be determined even when the number of clips corresponding to the single pad per one time pressing is two.
 When the number of the clips is two, a characteristic of the reaction force is grasped by the reaction force detecting means 132, based on the characteristic of the reaction force, Xmin, Xmax are set, and the values are provided to the clip
determining means 135L, 135R for determining the fitting of the clip.
 That is, in the clip fitting step 24, the press reaction force when the first member 15 is pressed to the second member 17 is detected, and based on the change in the press reaction force, it is determined whether the clip 37 is correctly
fitted.
 Referring back to FIG. 10, in the clip fitting step 24, there are detected the press reaction forces when the door trim 16 constituting the first member 15 is pressed by the press pads 54L, 54R provided at the front end portions of the two left
and right articulated robots 36L, 36R, based on the changes in the press reaction forces, it is determined whether the clip (notation 37 of FIG. 2) is correctly fitted and therefore, in coupling the first member and the second member by the clip and the
screw, confirmation of attaching the clip can be automated, a burden on the operator can be alleviated, and reliability of confirmation of mounting can be promoted.
 Further, the press reaction force can be detected by an inexpensive pressure sensor, the change in the press force can be determined by an inexpensive control portion and therefore, the exemplary embodiment can be embodied by inexpensive cost.
 When it is determined that the clip (notation 37 of FIG. 2) is correctly fitted, the screw is fastened.  Hence, operation of screw fastening means will be described as follows.
 In the screw fastening step 23, when the fitting is determined to be acceptable by the clip fitting determining means, the screw 84 for connecting the first member 15 to the second member 17 is fastened.
 FIGS. 15(a) to 15(e) illustrate operation views for explaining to bring the front end potion of the cylindrical member into contact with the head of the screw, and an explanation will be given of the fact that the screw provided to a screw
pressing portion 171 is adsorbed to be held by the screw adsorbing and holding mechanism 70 provided to the screw fastening jig 50.
 In FIG. 15(a), the screw fastening jig 50 attached to the front end portion of the robot arm 51 is made to face the screw 84 arranged at the screw pressing portion 171.  Specifically, the front end portion 71t of the cylindrical member 71 is
made to be proximate to the head 84t of the screw.
 In FIG. 15(b), the screw fastening jig.  50 is moved in arrow mark S direction further from the position of FIG. 15(a) to be proximate to the screw 84 and the front end portion 71t of the cylindrical member 71 is brought into contact with the
head 84t of the screw.
 FIG. 15(c) is a sectional view enlarging the portion of FIG. 15(b) showing that although the front end portion 71t of the cylindrical member 71 is brought into contact with the head 84t of the screw, the front end portion 66t of the driver bit
66 is not brought into contact with the head 84t of the screw.
 In FIG. 15(d), the screw fastening jig 50 is moved in the arrow mark S direction further from the position of FIG. 15(b), the screw fastening jig 50 is made to be proximate to the screw 84, and the front end portion 66t of the driver bit 66 is
brought into contact with the head 84t of the screw.
 FIG. 15(e) is the sectional view enlarging the portion of FIG. 15(d), showing that the front end portion 66t of the driver bit 66 is brought into contact with the head 84t of the screw.

screw by the rotating shaft turning mechanism 80.
 In FIG. 16(a), although there is brought about a state in which the front end portion 66t of the driver bit 66 is brought into contact with the head 84t of the screw, since the reaction force is not exerted to the front end portion 66t of the
driver bit 66, the rotating shaft 64 is not turned.
 In FIG. 16(b), in the state in which the front end portion 66t of the driver bit 66 is brought into contact with the head 84t of the screw, when the screw fastening jig 50 is moved further in the arrow mark S direction by a displacement y to
make the screw fastening jig 50 proximate to the screw 84, the rotating shaft 64 is moved rearward relative to the rotating cylinder 62, the rotating shaft 64 is turned along the spiral groove 81 provided at the rotating cylinder 62 and the driver bit 66
is turned by turning the rotating shaft 64.
 By turning the driver bit 66, the front end portion 66t of the driver bit 66 can be brought in mesh with the fastening groove 84m of the screw.
 In this way, the screw fastening jig 50 is provided with the rotating shaft turning mechanism 80 for rotating the rotating shaft 64 relative to the rotating cylinder 62 by operating the rotating shaft 64 to move rearward relative to the rotating
cylinder 62 between the rotating cylinder 62 and the rotating shaft 64 and therefore, it is possible to fit the front end portion 66t of the driver bit 66 to the fastening groove 84m of the screw by moving the jig base 52 including the rotating cylinder
62 forward in the axial direction, bringing the front end portion 66t of the driver bit 66 integral with the rotating shaft 64 into contact with the fastening groove 84m of the screw, further moving the jig base 52 forward in the axial direction and
rotating the driver bit 66.
 Further, since there is provided the rotating shaft turning mechanism 80 for rotating the rotating shaft 64 when the rotating shaft 64 is moved rearward relative to the rotating cylinder 62 in the axial direction, driving means by power of, for
example, a motor or the like is dispensed with for rotating the driver bit 66.
 The rotating shaft 64 can be turned without using driving means by power, and the front end portion 66t of the driver bit 66 can smoothly be fitted to the fastening groove 84m of the screw.
 In addition thereto, energy saving formation can be achieved since driving means by power is not used.
 FIG. 17 is an operation view showing that the driver bit is brought in mesh with the head of the screw, by bringing the front end portion 71t of the cylindrical member 71 into contact with the head 84t of the screw prepared at the screw pressing
portion 171, bringing the driver bit 66 in mesh therewith, successively, reducing a pressure of an inner portion 71i of the cylindrical member 71, the screw can be adsorbed to be held thereby.
 Thereafter, the screw fastening jig 50 adsorbing to hold the screw 84 is moved to face the work.
 Here, although when the screw is lifted from the screw pressing portion 171 while the screw 84 is adsorbed to be held thereby, the first spring member 95 is elongated, the front end portion 66t of the driver bit 66 is separated from the
fastening groove 84m of the screw, the second spring member 75 provided to the rotating shaft turning mechanism 80 is elongated, the rotating shaft 64 is turned and therefore, temporarily, a phase between a position of the fastening groove 84m of the
screw and a position of the front end portion 66t of the driver bit 66 is shifted, when the front end portion of the cylindrical member 71 is brought into contact with the work to start fastening, again, the rotating shaft 64 and the front end portion
66t of the driver bit 66 rotated integrally with the rotating shaft 64 are rotated up to a position at which the front end portion 66t is brought in mesh with the fastening groove 84m of the screw and therefore, the front end portion 66t of the driver
bit 66 and the fastening groove 84m of the screw coincide with each other.
