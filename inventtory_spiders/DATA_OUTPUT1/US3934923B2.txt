patent_description: 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates generally to reducing aerodynamic drag on vehicles such as trucks, trailors, etc. More particularly, it concerns the provision of means to eliminate or reduce the drag inducing effect of airflow through the gap between
vehicle components, as for example between truck tractor and trailer units.
It is found that a major cause of aerodynamic drag in tractor-trailer or tractor semi-trailer combinations, is the gap between the tractor and trailer units.  Certain of the relative airflow over the tractor cab passes downwardly into the gap and
then outwardly at the gap bottom and lateral sides, disturbing the airflow along the vehicle and creating drag.  Lateral cross-winds or gusts entering the gap have the same drag inducing effect.  While certain so-called air deflectors have been provided
on tractor cabs in the past, they do not operate in the manner provided by the present invention to reduce drag induced by airflow through the gap, and they tend to produce airflow conditions which do not sufficiently resist cross-wind flow into the gap.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is a major object of the invention to provide a drag reducing means that operates to decelerate relative airflow rearwardly into the gap, thereby to create air pressure conditions in the gap that tend to divert or prevent cross-wind flow
through the gap, thereby lessening drag.  Basically, the drag reducing means comprises:
A. POROUS STRUCTURE ADAPTED TO BE MOUNTED ON THE TRUCK TO PROJECT ABOVE THE CAB ROOF AND EXTEND LATERALLY, SO AS TO BE PRESENTED FORWARDLY TOWARD ONCOMING RELATIVE AIRFLOW FOR PASSING AIR REARWARDLY THERETHROUGH TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE BODY, WITH
ACCOMPANYING AIR DECELERATION RELATIVE TO THE TRUCK, AND
B. AIRFLOW DIRECTING MEANS AT LATERALLY OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE STRUCTURE FOR DIRECTING ONCOMING RELATIVE AIRFLOW LATERALLY AROUND SAID ENDS.
As will be seen, the porous structure extends upright and preferably contains through openings which may for example be circular, linear or have other shape; also the porous structure preferably has plate form and is spaced above the roof of the
tractor cab to provide an additional air decelerating passage directly above the roof.  Further, the airflow directing means may define forwardly protruding, upright surfaces at laterally opposite sides of the porous structure, whereby the combined
porous plate and flow directing protrusions are forwardly concave.  The lateral sides of the protrusions preferably extend rearwardly to block cross-wind disturbance of the decelerating flow rearwardly of the porous structure, and the latter may be
integral with or spaced laterally from the airflow directing means, as will be seen.
It is a further object of the invention to provide a protrusion or protrusions on the front wall and/or sides and/or top of the trailer unit to cooperate with the drag reducing means to further lessen drag, in the manner to be described.
These and other objects of advantages of the invention, as well as the details of illustrative embodiments, will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings, in which:

Referring first to FIG. 1, a truck tractor 10 is shown pulling a truck trailer unit 11.  The body 12 of the latter has an upstanding front wall 13 rearwardly of the tractor cab 14, and projecting upwardly above the roof level 15 of the cab.  The
tractor also conventionally includes wheels 150 and front windshield 16.
In accordance with the invention, drag reducing means comprises porous structure, as for example that shown at 17 in FIGS. 1-3, adapted to be mounted on the truck to project upwardly above the roof 15, and to extend laterally so as to be
presented forwardly toward oncoming relative airflow.  The porous structure is such as to pass oncoming air rearwardly therethrough toward the front 13 of the body 12, as indicated by the arrows 18a-18e in FIG. 3, and arrows 19a-19f in FIG. 4. 
Deceleration of the airflow relative to the truck is thereby achieved, as indicated by the divergence of such arrows at the rear of the structure 17, and a region of flow turbulence characterized by a large number of small eddy currents is apparently
formed.  Such small eddies are shown at 100 and are produced in the region 20, appearing to serve as a barrier to airflow into that region from the sides and top, as is clear from the flow arrows 22 in FIG. 3 and 23 in FIG. 4.  The average flow
velocities in the eddies are relatively low, which contributes to stabilization of the air mass in the gap.  This is significantly different from large scale vortices produced by an imperforate shield, which cause high fluctuating velocities and actually
induce airflow into the gap from the sides and top.  Further, the screen type unit 17 is subject to greatly reduced air loading and consequently reduces cab roof loading, as compared to an impervious air shield; also, unsteady buffeting is reduced, and
the truck driver achieves a smoother ride.
The porous structure may with unusual advantage comprise a porous plate 24 forming spaced apart, generally circular, through openings 25 as seen in FIGS. 2 to 4.  Alternatively, FIG. 9 shows linearly elongated horizontal openings 27 in modified
porous plate 24a, and FIG. 10 shows linearly elongated vertical openings 28 in modified porous plate 24b.  It is also clear from FIGS. 1, 2 and 4 that the porous structure is preferably mounted on the cab 14 in spaced relation above the cab roof 15, to
provide an opening or gap 29 between the lowermost extent of the porous structure and roof, and which provides for additional air deceleration, in the manner described above.  See flow arrow 30 through that gap or opening in FIG. 4.  Mounting brackets 31
and 32 may be provided for this purpose.
The drag reducing means also includes airflow directing means at laterally opposite sides of the porous structure for directing oncoming relative airflow around the laterally opposite ends of the porous structure.  As shown in FIGS. 1-4, the
airflow directing means 133 may with unusual advantage define surfaces 33 which are generally vertically elongated and project with forward convexity forwardly of a plane defined by the forward face of plate 24.  The surfaces also have rearward
extensions or skirts 33a which extend rearwardly of the plane of the plate 24, at the lateral boundaries of the airflow directing means.  The arrows 22 in FIG. 3 indicate that airflow is directed toward the lateral sides of the region 20 previously
described and that such flow is directed around the sharp corners or edges 37 at the lateral boundaries of body front wall 13; similarly, the arrows 23 in FIG. 4 indicate that airflow is directed toward the top of the region, and over the top edge of
corner 38 at the upper boundary of body front wall 13.  Furthermore, such flow paths tend to keep cross-wind gusts out of the region or gap 20 so as to eliminate or lessen drag that would otherwise be produced as a result of cross-wind flow through that
gap.  Thus, the vanes tend to rectify the cross-wind flow.
In FIGS. 1-4, the flow directing means 133 is advantageously made integral with the porous structure 17, i.e., as a single sheet or plate of material, such as molded glass fibers and resin.  The brackets 31 are shown as attached to the lower
extremities of the means 133, which is spaced above the cab roof 15.  Arrows 40 in FIG. 3 show oncoming airflow directed laterally reversely around the surfaces 33, forwardly of those portions 33b of surface 33 which concavely merge with lateral extents
of plate 24.  Accordingly, the surfaces 33 and plate 24 define a generally forwardly concave unit, with U-shaped cross sections in horizontal planes.
FIGS. 1-4 also show the employment of a refrigeration unit 110 mounted on the body front wall 13, for receiving impingement of airflow acting to transfer heat from the unit to the atmosphere.  Such heat is typically extracted from coolant fluid
circulated into the interior of the body 12 to maintain that interior at a low temperature.  The present invention does not impede the flow of air to the unit 110 and thereby enables it to function efficiently.  This is to be distinguished from generally
air impervious air shields mounted on the cab and which deflect the air around the gap 20 and as a result "starve" the refrigeration unit of cooling air, resulting in overheating of the refrigerator condenser unit, or of the motor driving the unit.
FIG. 11 shows alternate flow directing means in the form of forwardly directed vanes 142 having convex forward surfaces 42 and rearwardly tapering bodies 43 spaced at 44 from the lateral extents of porous structure 117.  Vanes 142 have about the
same height as the structure 117, and are attached as by brackets 142a or other suitable means to the cab roof.
Actual tests on a tractor and semi-trailer unit with and without the drag reducer of FIGS. 1-4 show 24% air drag reduction when the reducer was used.  Dimensions of the reducer were as follows:
Overall Height 36 inches  Width of Porous  plate 24 40 inches  Width of each Flow  director 133 16 inches  Radius of curved  surface 33 9 inches  Diameters of  holes 25 21/2 inches  Percentage of plate  24 area occupied by  holes 25 45-55%
Extending the description to FIG. 5, a modified drag reducer 50 (for decelerating relative airflow) includes a porous plate 51 and lateral flow directors 52 integral therewith.  Brackets 53 and 54 mount the reducer 50 to the roof 55 of truck
tractor 56.  The truck trailer 57 has a front wall 58, and a forwardly convex protrusion bounding at least a portion of the front wall and spaced rearwardly of the flow decelerating drag reducing means 50.  A gap is shown at 59 between the tractor and
trailer units 56 and 57, and the means 50 tends to keep cross-winds out of the gap, as described above, and thereby reduce drag.
The protrusion referred to above on wall 58 cooperates with the drag reducer 50, serving to lessen drag to even further extent, and may take the form of the protrusion structure described in co-pending application Ser.  No. 503,290 of Paul B.
MacCready, Jr., and Peter Lissaman.  For example, the forwardly convex protrusion may extend generally horizontally at 60 along the uppermost extent of front wall 58; alternatively, or in addition, the protrusion may extend generally vertically at 61
along sidewardmost extent or extents of the front wall.  Protrusions 60 and 61 merge at diagonal locations 160; and FIG. 6 shows that protrusions 61 extend laterally to greater extent than drag reducer 50, while protrusion 60 extends at a level above the
top-most level of reducer 50.  Finally, as in FIG. 5a additional horizontal and vertical protrusions 62 and 63 may be applied to the side wall or walls of the trailer body 57, in the manner described in said co-pending application, to lessen the effects
of cross-winds impinging on the body.  Also, a horizontal protrusion 64 may extend above the top surface 65 of the body 57 and laterally, adjacent horizontal corner 138, as seen in FIG. 8a.
Turning to FIG. 12, a unit 150, like that seen at 50 in FIG. 5, is pivotally mounted at 151 to the roof 152 of the tractor cab 153.  It is swingable about the horizontal transverse axis of the mount 151 between an up-position as shown in broken
lines 150a and a down-position in solid lines in which the structure extends generally horizontally forwardly.  In the latter position it offers very little wind resistance, as is desirable when the tractor is being driven with no trailer attached
thereto.  Actuator means may be connected with the unit 150 to swing same between up and down position as described.  One such actuator comprises a manually operable lever 154 pivotally connected with the cab at 155, and a link 156 pivotally connected at
157 to the lever and 158 to the unit 150.  In lever forward position, the unit 150 is in down position, and the lever may be held in that position by a clevis pin 159 inserted through the lever and into one opening in a fixed plate 160 attached to the
cab.  In lever rearward position, the unit 150 is in upright operative (air decelerating) position, and the lever may be held in that position by the clevis pin inserted through the lever and into another opening in the plate, at locus 159a.
 Turning to FIG. 13, the tractor cab 156, trailer body 112, and drag reducing unit 117 correspond to elements 56, 12 and 17, respectively, of FIGS. 1-4.  Also provided is a flexible curtain 170 extending generally vertically and forwardly in the
gap 120 between the cab and trailer body, generally centrally of the gap.  The curtain functions to block transverse flow of air through the gap, i.e., airflow in directions indicated by arrows 171 and 172.  Curtain 170 may be rolled on a spring-loaded,
vertical roller 173 carried at 174 by and adjacent the back wall 156a of the tractor cab.  The curtain rearward edge 170a extends adjacent the front wall 113 of the cab and is hooked at 175 to the latter, roller 173 tensioning the curtain, as by urging
it rearwardly in a roll-up direction at all times.  Thus, the curtain is maintained taut as the tractor turns relative to the trailer during operation of the rig.
In the FIG. 13a modification, the flexible curtain 270 extending in a vertical, forwardly extending plane, is wound on a vertical spool 271 carried by frame 272.  Attachment means, such as hooks 273 on the frame, and eye brackets 274 on the
trailer body front wall 213, removably attach the frame and curtain to the trailer body 212.  For example, the hooks are receivable in the eye brackets, as shown.  An adjustment handle 275 on the spool is rotatable to control the unwound length of the
curtain 270 extending in the gap 276 between the body front wall 213 and the tractor cab rear wall 277.
The forward edge portion 270a of the curtain 270 is attached to cables 278 which are spooled on a vertical drum 279.  The latter is spring-urged, internally, to tend to wind the cables, thereby to maintain the curtain 270 taut, as in FIG. 13, and
the drum yields to unspool the tensioned cables when the tractor turns relative to the tractor, widening gap 276.  Drum axles 280 are carried by bracket 281 attached to the tractor cab rear wall 277.
In use, the truck operator need only hook the bracket 272 onto a trailer, and adjust the length of the curtain 270 to the width of the gap, as by turning handle 275.  A suitable locking means, such as at 285, is provided to lock the curtain spool
271 against turning relative to bracket 272, when the curtain is selectively extended as shown, and tensioned as by the cables and drum 279.  Element 285 is shown as a lug thread connected to the handle 275, and capable of selective advancement to engage
openings in the bracket part 272a, and retraction to free the handle for turning.
