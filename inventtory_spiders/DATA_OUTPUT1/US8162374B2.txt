abstract: 
 A vehicle safety seat system includes a seat, and a frame and support
     surface that are movable with respect to each other between rest and
     attenuated positions, wherein the frame and support surface are
     respectively a first and second distance apart. A biasing mechanism
     biases the frame and support surface to the rest position between blast
     and slam down phases. A damper coupled between the frame and support
     surface has blast and rebound recovery resistance settings. The blast
     resistance setting is set to a predetermined value based on a weight of a
     seat occupant. The damper, during the blast phase, resists motion between
     the frame and support surface toward the attenuated position based upon
     the blast resistance setting, and after the blast phase and prior to the
     slam down phase, resists motion between the frame and support surface
     toward the rest position based upon the rebound recovery resistance
     setting.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 An embodiment of the present invention relates generally to a vehicle safety seat system, and more particularly, to a dual stage variable load energy absorber for preventing injuries to occupants in vehicles during mine blasts or the like for
both blast and slam down crash phases.
 During the 1980's, energy absorbers (EAs) were developed and extensively tested for certain rotary wing aircraft (e.g., helicopters).  The purpose of these devices was to limit the vertical loading (accelerations) experienced by the occupants,
and thus reduce the probability of serious injuries that could occur during certain types of crash events.  As a result of this development, unique and discrete EAs were ultimately integrated into several series of U.S.  Military helicopters and, more
recently, select ground vehicles, and these devices have been successfully used for decades to reduce the probability of crash induced spinal injuries.
 Helicopter seat mounted EA devices and current ground vehicle EA devices only operate to mitigate a single loading event over a well defined range of exposures.  When a military type ground vehicle is exposed to a blast, the occupant experiences
two defined exposures within a short time period: loading from the blast itself as the vehicle is being propelled upward and when the vehicle returns to the earth, which produces a "slam down." The force exposure of the slam down can be just as severe as
the force exposure of the blast portion.  Thus, strict adaptations of the helicopter EA devices (currently in use in select ground vehicles) are not sufficiently effective.  Prior attempts to adapt the helicopter EA devices create additional hazards for
the ground vehicle occupant without completely mitigating the exposure experienced by the occupant.
 The function of an EA is to permit the seat to stroke downward in a controlled manner to reduce the crash loads and accelerations applied to the occupant, (i.e., limit acceleration forces applied to the seated occupant) as compared to the crash
acceleration input at the floor of the vehicle.  The stroking is designed specifically to initiate at a predetermined force level and continue until the input load drops below the threshold of human injury tolerance.  The available stroke distance must
be sufficiently long to avoid expending the stroke distance and instantaneously acquiring the velocity of the vehicle floor.  The basis for the theory behind this concept is the law of "conservation of energy," which manages the energy of a crash through
reshaping the occupant's acceleration versus time response curve in a manner that reduces the peak accelerations.  Adaptations of helicopter EA devices for use in Military Ground Vehicles do not account for the dual effect of the blast and slam down, nor
do they account for the variation in load created by the varying weights of the occupant, both with and without battle gear, or the variable sizes of blasts experienced by military vehicles.
 In a Military Ground Vehicle, the effect of any given blast can have a large variability due to the variability in occupant mass, but is also exacerbated by the point of blast contact with the vehicle, the magnitude of the blast (blast energy),
the type of blast, and the vehicle's characteristics, such as mass and deformation.  This variability poses a unique threat in that the input shock effect and input acceleration to the occupants can vary widely in both magnitude and direction.  Unlike
ground vehicles exposed to a large variety of mine and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blasts, the vertical input accelerations imposed during helicopter crashes are relatively predictable and fall within a known, and relatively narrow, band.  One
reason is that many survivable helicopter crashes tend to occur as a result of power loss followed by autorotation where the aircraft impact velocity vector is well established both in magnitude and direction.  In contrast, a ground vehicle exposed to a
blast experiences the wide range of input accelerations and orientations due to the blast itself, followed by the input accelerations resulting from the subsequent slam down when the vehicle returns to the ground.  The slam down acceleration vectors also
vary greatly due to the blast severity, the orientation of the vehicle when it impacts the ground, and the ground characteristics.
 It is therefore desirable to provide an EA device for a military-type ground vehicle that accounts automatically for the variation in total occupant seated mass; provides energy absorption for the variable blast phase; provides energy absorption
for the slam down phase by automatically resetting itself after the blast phase; prevents "bottoming out" during either of the loading phases so as to not generate a dynamic amplification spike to the occupant; and maintains crash effectiveness in either
frontal, lateral, rear or rollover crash events.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 Briefly stated, an embodiment of the present invention comprises a mine blast and slam down protective vehicle safety seat system including a vehicle seat, a frame supporting the vehicle seat, and a support surface supporting the frame.  The
frame and support surface are movable with respect to each other between a rest position, wherein the frame and support surface are a first distance apart, and an attenuated position, wherein the frame and support surface are a second distance apart. 
The second distance is less than the first distance.  A biasing mechanism biases the frame and support surface to the rest position between a blast phase and a slam down phase.  A variable resistance damper is operatively coupled between the frame and
the support surface.  The damper has a blast resistance setting to account for variable loading and a rebound recovery resistance setting.  The blast resistance setting is automatically set to a predetermined value based on a weight of an occupant of the
vehicle seat.  The damper is configured to (i) during the blast phase where the support surface and frame move toward each other, resist respective motion between the frame and the support surface based upon the blast resistance setting until the frame
and support surface reach the attenuated position, and (ii) after completion of the blast phase, resist respective motion between the frame and the support surface caused by the biasing mechanism based upon the rebound recovery resistance setting until
the frame and support surface reach the rest position prior to the slam down phase.
 Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a method of protecting a vehicle occupant positioned on a vehicle seat which is movably mounted with respect to a vehicle floor in an explosive blast.  The method includes determining a
weight of the occupant in the seat, establishing a blast resistance setting based upon the weight of the occupant, and establishing a rebound recovery resistance setting.  The method further includes, during a blast phase, resisting respective motion
between the vehicle seat and the vehicle floor based upon the blast resistance setting.  The method also includes, after completion of the blast phase and prior to a slam down phase, resisting respective motion between the vehicle seat and the vehicle
mount based upon the rebound recovery resistance setting.
 A further embodiment of the present invention comprises a mine blast and slam down protective vehicle safety seat system including a vehicle seat, a frame supporting the vehicle seat, and a support surface supporting the frame.  The frame and
support surface are movable with respect to each other between a rest position, wherein the frame and support surface are a first distance apart, and an attenuated position, wherein the frame and support surface are a second distance apart.  The second
distance is less than the first distance.  A biasing mechanism biases the frame and support surface to the rest position between a blast phase and a slam down phase.  A damper is operatively coupled between the frame and the support surface.  The damper
has a resistance setting.  The damper is configured to, during the blast phase where the support surface and frame move toward each other, resist respective motion between the frame and the support surface based upon the resistance setting until the
frame and support surface reach the attenuated position. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 Certain terminology is used in the following description for convenience only and is not limiting.  The words "right", "left", "lower", and "upper" designate directions in the drawings to which reference is made.  The words "inwardly" and
"outwardly" refer to directions toward and away from, respectively, the geometric center of the vehicle seat safety system and designated parts thereof.  The terminology includes the above-listed words, derivatives thereof, and words of similar import. 
Additionally, the words "a" and "an", as used in the claims and in the corresponding portions of the specification, mean "at least one."
 Referring to the drawings in detail, wherein the same reference numerals indicate like elements throughout, there is shown in FIG. 1 a vehicle safety seat system, generally designated 10, having a vehicle seat 12, a frame 14 supporting the
vehicle seat 12, and a support surface 16 supporting the frame 14.  The vehicle seat 12 may be of any type that can be ordinarily installed in a vehicle (not shown), particularly a military vehicle, which may be subject to space and mounting location
requirements based on equipment and the like.  For example, U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,155,601 and 6,520,541, both of which are incorporated by reference herein, disclose seats that may be employed for use in the vehicle safety seat system 10.
 The vehicle safety seat system 10 is preferably installed as a unit (i.e., the seat 12, the frame 14, and the support surface 16 are installed together) in a vehicle in either the front or back seat positions.  The seat 12 may, however, be
removably coupled to the frame 14 such that the frame 14 and the support surface 16 alone may be installed in the vehicle and the seat 12 may be mounted thereon at a later time.  The seat 12 is also preferably detachable for purposes of cleaning, repair,
replacement, or the like, or if more storage space is required in the vehicle.  Similarly, the frame 14 may also be removably attached to the support surface 16 such that the support surface 16 alone may be installed in the vehicle.  Alternatively, the
support surface 16 may comprise at least a portion of the floor or other surface of the vehicle itself, such as a bulkhead behind the seat, wall, floor, rear mounting, or suspended from an overhead roof structure.  The frame is preferably manufactured
using a lightweight, durable material, such as steel.  However, other suitable materials, or combinations of materials, may be used such as plastics, polymers, metals, metal alloys, or the like.  The support surface 16, to the extent the support surface
16 does not include the floor or other surface of the vehicle, is also made from lightweight, durable materials.  The frame 14 and the support surface 16 are most often found in a rest position (FIG. 1), wherein the frame 14 is a first distance D.sub.1
apart from the support surface 16.  The frame 14 and the support surface 16 are movable with respect to each other between the rest position and an attenuated position (FIG. 2), wherein the frame 14 is a second distance D.sub.2 apart from the support
surface 16.  The second distance D.sub.2 is less than the first distance D.sub.1.  Motion between the frame 14 and the support surface 16 is preferably confined to a vertical direction, as will be described below.  It is this controlled movement that
prevents injury to an occupant of the seat 12 during vertical acceleration forces.
 Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the support surface 16 may include, positioned beneath the frame 14, a block 15 of energy absorption material having a rate sensitive compression characteristic.  The block 15 is preferably secured to the support
surface 16 using mechanical fasteners.  Alternatively, the block 15 may also be secured to the support surface or the underside of the support surface using an adhesive, hook-and-loop fastener, vacuum, or the like.  The material composition of the block
15 is preferably a known energy absorbing crushable material.  The block 15 is provided to resist "bottoming out" of the vehicle safety seat system 10 when the frame 14 and the support surface 16 reach the maximum attenuated position (e.g., FIG. 2).  The
block 15 compresses by a predetermined thickness to absorb the remaining energy not absorbed by the vehicle safety seat system 10, as described in more detail below.  The block 15 may alternatively be attached to at least one of an underside of the seat
12 and the frame 14.
 Referring to FIGS. 1 and 3, the vehicle safety seat system 10 further includes a dual stage energy absorber 20 operatively coupled between the frame 14 and the support surface 16.  The energy absorber 20 preferably includes a damper 22, and more
preferably includes a variable resistance damper 22, for example, a variable load shock absorber, such as those manufactured by Penske Racing Shocks of Reading, Pa.  The damper 22 is preferably a hydraulic damper, but may also be one of a pneumatic
damper, an inversion tube, a wire-bending damper, a rolling torus, rod-pull-through-tube, tension pulley, viscous coupling, or the like.  Alternatively, the energy absorber 20 can include any device capable of permitting adjustment of resistance, such as
a wire bender, inversion tube, a ball-in-tube, or the like.  The energy absorber 20 also preferably includes a biasing mechanism 24, such as a spring or the like, for biasing the frame 14 and the support surface 16 to the rest position, particularly
between a blast phase and a slam down phase, as will be described below.  The biasing mechanism 24 shown in the drawings is a spring coiled around the damper 22.  When the frame 14 and the support surface 16 are in the attenuated position (FIG. 2), the
spring 24 is compressed around the damper 22.  However, the biasing mechanism 24 need not be part of the energy absorber 20, and may be separately incorporated into the vehicle safety seat system 10 (not shown).
 In a preferred embodiment, shown in FIG. 3, the damper 22 (shown in FIG. 3 without the surrounding spring 24) is coupled to the support surface 16 via a first bracket 30 and pin 31.  On a side of the damper 22 opposite the first bracket 30, an
external piston 32 connects to a bell crank 34.  The bell crank 34 is also coupled to the support surface 16 by a second bracket 36 about a pin 38 which forms a pivot point.  Pivoting of the bell crank 34 about the pin 38 is controlled by the pivot point
and force is carried by an end fitting 40 to the external piston 32 of the energy absorber 20.  The bell crank 34 is further coupled to the frame 14 by a frame end fitting 42.  While a bell crank 34 is preferred, any mechanical assembly suitable for
translating the relative vertical motion of the frame 14 and the support surface 16 into horizontal motion directed to the energy absorber 20 may be utilized, for example, such as a pinion coupling a vertical rack and a horizontal rack.  Alternatively,
space permitting, the energy absorber 20 may be arranged vertically, such as underneath or behind the seat, to directly resist the relative vertical motion of the frame 14 and the support surface 16, eliminating the need to translate the motion, or may
be relocated to the underside or perimeter of the seat frame as defined by vehicle mounting hard points.
 Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, the frame 14 includes at least one stroking beam 44 having linear bearings 46 at the ends thereof, which surround and slide on support posts 50 for low friction movement in the vertical direction, but prevent
horizontal movement in all directions.  The linear bearings 46 are preferably rolling-element type bearings made from suitable metals or other materials.  The support posts 50 and linear bearings 46 may interact by, for example, wrapping a bearing 46
around a portion of the respective support post 50, providing a track on the support post 50, or the like.  The portions of the support posts 50 that interact with the linear bearings 46 are preferably made of hardened or stainless steel, but depending
on the type of linear bearing 46, may also be made from tempered aluminum, mild steel, or the like.  Any portion of the support posts 50 not interacting with the linear bearings 46 may be made of the same or a different material, preferably a
light-weight, durable metal, plastic, or the like.  The support posts 50 are fixed to the support surface 16.  In a preferred embodiment, two stroking beams 44 are utilized, each being coupled to a pair of support posts 50 (as best seen in FIG. 4).  A
platform 48 may be provided to mount the seat 12 onto the stroking beams 44.  The seat 12 may be fixedly or removably coupled to the platform 48 using brackets 45, or alternatively, the seat 12 may be secured to the platform 48 using bolts or like
mechanical fasteners.  Other techniques for securing the seat 12 to the platform 48 include adhesives, hook-and-loop fasteners, vacuum, or the like.
 FIG. 4 shows a microprocessor 52 mounted on the support surface 16.  The microprocessor 52 may be mounted as needed provided it is communicatively coupled with the energy absorber 20 for varying resistance settings of the damper 22.  The
microprocessor 52 accepts as an input the weight of the occupant in the seat 12.  The weight may be input manually, such as through a keypad, automatically measured using a weight sensor operatively coupled to the seat 12 that weighs the occupant, or the
like.  It is preferred to include at least one weight sensor in the seat 12 such that the weight of the occupant may be periodically updated or continually monitored to compensate for weight changes resulting from adding or removal of equipment by the
occupant while seated.  Settings of the damper 22 may therefore be updated periodically based on a running average weight.  Further, it is preferred that settings of the damper 22 be reset to a neutral value after a zero or negligible weight is sensed
for a prolonged duration (e.g., ten seconds).  The damper 22 settings will accommodate a 5.sup.th percentile female up to a 95.sup.th percentile male soldier equipped with full battle gear.
 Operation of the vehicle safety seat system 10 will now be described.  The damper 22 includes blast and slam down resistance settings, to account for variable loading, and a rebound recovery resistance setting.  In certain embodiments, the blast
resistance setting is also utilized as the slam down resistance setting.  The blast resistance setting is set to a predetermined value by the microcontroller 52 based on the weight of the occupant in the vehicle seat 12 established, preferably
immediately after the occupant sits in the seat 12.  For example, the microcontroller 52 may follow the logic shown in FIG. 5.  Once the weight of the occupant of the seat 12 is determined at step 100, the weight is filtered within a sliding window at
step 102 to prevent momentary accelerations due to rough terrain from affecting the capability of the energy absorber 20.  For example, the weight range of a 5.sup.th percentile female to a 95.sup.th percentile male equipped with full battle gear may be
divided into ten pound increments, and the weight of the occupant is placed into one of the ten pound increments.  At step 104, the microcontroller 52 initializes a table lookup.  At step 106, a blast resistance setting value is found.  At step 108, the
microcontroller 52 adjusts the resistance of the damper 22 to the blast resistance setting value.
 For embodiments where a slam down resistance setting is also adjusted, the procedure is preferably identical.  In certain embodiments, the rebound recovery resistance setting is fixed for all occupants because, as will be described below, during
recovery of the vehicle safety seat system 10, the occupant is experiencing a force of 1 g and is not firmly coupled to the seat 12.  However, it is within the scope of embodiments of the present invention to adjust the rebound recovery resistance
setting as described above with other settings.  The vehicle safety seat system 10 also preferably is redundant to allow the energy absorber 20 to function despite battle damage.  For example, in the event of a systemic or local power failure, the damper
22 will function at resistance settings based on the last measured weight of the occupant.  As described above, the weight of the occupant will be measured by a weight sensing system when the occupant sits in the seat 12 and stored by the microprocessor
52.  The occupant's weight will be monitored throughout the mission to determine if the occupant's weight has changed due to the addition or deletion of equipment.  The microprocessor 52 preferably only utilizes weight data gathered while the vehicle is
not experiencing significant vertical acceleration.
 Once a vehicle encounters a mine, explosive, or other trauma resulting in a sudden vertical acceleration, the "blast phase" is entered.  During the blast phase, the frame 14 strokes downward a defined distance through rotation of frame end
fitting 42.  Blast forces are transmitted by the bell crank 34 to the energy absorber 20.  The damper 22 resists respective motion of the frame 14 toward the support surface 16 based upon the blast resistance setting.  The damper 22 resists the motion
until the frame 14 and the support surface 16 reach the attenuated position.
 After completion of the blast phase, when the forces from the blast are no longer impacting the vehicle, the biasing mechanism 24 returns the frame 14 and support surface 16 to the rest position through the bell crank 34.  In one embodiment, the
damper 22 does not resist the return motion of the frame 14 and the support surface 16.  Alternatively, the damper 22 resists respective motion of the frame 14 and the support surface 16 based upon the rebound recovery resistance setting.  Recovery takes
place as the vehicle is returning to the ground.  The damper 22 resists the motion until the frame 14 and the support surface 16 reach the rest position prior to the "slam down phase." The recovery period is on the order of approximately 100
milliseconds.  Once the vehicle impacts the ground following a blast, further sudden vertical accelerations are experienced by the occupant.  Thus, the slam down phase is entered.  Once again, the frame 14 strokes downward and the damper 22 resists
respective motion of the frame 14 and the support surface 16 based upon either the previous blast resistance setting or a separate slam down resistance setting, as described above.  Motion is resisted until the frame 14 and the support surface 16 again
reach the maximum attenuated position or the event is over.  The biasing mechanism 24 preferably returns the frame 14 and the support surface 16 to the rest position once again following completion of the slam down phase.  The sequence may be repeated as
necessary to prevent occupant injury.
 Although several preferred embodiments of the vehicle safety seat system 10 have been described herein, other embodiments may be employed without departing from the scope of the invention.  It is contemplated that the vehicle safety seat system
10 is capable of accommodating occupants from a 5.sup.th percentile female in civilian clothing to a 95.sup.th percentile male with full combat gear and equipment.  Further, the resistance settings are preferably established in accordance with accepted
vertical acceleration forces for human tolerance as expressed by, for example, well-known Eiband tolerance curves or other Injury Assessment Reference Values (IARVs), as found commonly in the literature.  Changing threats and revisions to human tolerance
threshold values may also result in changes to the resistance settings
 From the foregoing, it can be seen that embodiments of the present invention comprise a vehicle safety seat system, and particularly a dual stage variable load energy absorber for preventing injuries to occupants in vehicles during mine blasts
or the like for both blast and slam down crash phases.  It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof.  It is understood,
therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but it is intended to cover modifications within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
