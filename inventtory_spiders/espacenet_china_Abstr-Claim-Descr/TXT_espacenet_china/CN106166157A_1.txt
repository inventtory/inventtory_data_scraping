S lfamoyibenzamide Derivatives as Antiviral Agents against HBV Infection      CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS      [0001 ] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 /503830 fifed July 1 , 201 1 , which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.      FIELD OF INVENTION      [0002] The present invention describes compounds and methods useful as pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors, useful for the treatment of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and related conditions.      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION      [0003] Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major public health problem. Currently, an estimated 350 million people worldwide and 1.4 million in the US are chronically infected with HBV (McMahon, 2005). Approximately one-third of these individuals will die from serious liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, if left untreated (Lee, 1997; Lok, 2004).      [0004] Seven drugs are currently available for the management of chronic hepatitis B, which include two formulations of alpba-interferon (standard and pegylaied) and five nuc3eos(t)ide analogues (lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine. and tenofovir) that inhibit HBV DNA polymerase (Keeffe et al., 2008). At present, the preferred first-line treatment choices are entecavir, tenofovir or peg-interferon alfa-2a. However, even with the first-line treatment options, peg- interferon alfa-2a is effective in achieving certain serological milestones in only one-third of treated patients and frequently associated with severe side effects (Janssen et al., 2005; Lau et al., 2005; Perrillo, 2009). Entecavir and tenofovir are highly potent HBV inhibitors, but a long-term or possibly life-time treatment is required to continuously suppress HBV replication, which may eventually fail due to emergence of drug resistant viruses (Dienstag, 2009). Hence, there is a pressing need for the introduction of novel, safe and effective therapies for chronic hepatitis B, which is listed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as a High Priority Area of Interest.      [0005] HBV is a noncytopathic, liver tropic DNA virus belonging to Hepadnaviridae family. Pregenomic (pg) RNA is the template for reverse transcriptional replication of HBV DNA and its encapsidation, together with viral DNA polymerase, into nucleocapsid is essential for the   subsequent viral DNA synthesis. Inhibition of pregenomic RNA (pg) encapsidation would block HBV replication and provide a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of HBV.      [0006] Clinically, inhibition of pregenomic RNA (pg) encapsidation offers the following therapeutic advantages: First, inhibition of pregenomic RNA (pg) encapsidation will complement the current medications by providing an additional option for a subpopulation of patients that do not tolerate or benefit from the current medications(Akbar et al., 2009; Liaw, 2009; Peters, 2009; Wiegand, van Bommel, and Berg). Second, based on their distinct antiviral mechanism, inhibition of pregenomic RNA (pg) encapsidation will be effective against HBV variants that are resistant to the currently available DNA polymerase inhibitors (Zoulim and Locarnini, 2009). Third, like the Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (Este and Cihlar), combination therapy of the inhibitors of pregenomic RNA (pg) encapsidation with DNA polymerase inhibitors should synergistically suppress HBV replication and prevent the emergence of drag resistance and thus offers a safer and more effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B infection.      [0007] There is a long felt need for new antiviral dmgs that are both disease- modifying and effective in treating patients that are infected with hepatitis B vims. There is also a clear and present need for new antiviral dmgs that are both disease modifying and effective in treating patients that are infected with drug resistant hepatitis B virus. The present invention addresses the need for new antiviral drugs that are both disease-modifying and effective in treating patients that are infected with hepatitis B virus.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION      [0021] The pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of the present invention are capable of treating and preventing diseases associated with pregenomic R A encapsidation, for example HBV infection. Pregenomic (pg) RNA is the template for reverse transcriptional replication of HBV DNA and its encapsidation, together with viral DNA polymerase, into nucleocapsid is essential for the subsequent viral DNA synthesis. Without wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that inhibition of pregenomic RNA encapsidation can ameliorate, abate, or otherwise cause to be controlled, diseases associated with pregenomic RNA encapsidation, for example HBV infection.     Pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of the present invention address the clear and unmet need to identify novel and safe antiviral agents for the treatment of HBV infection that are chemically and mechanistically distinct from HBV antiviral drugs in current clinical use.      [0022] Clinically, the pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of the present invention complement the current medications by providing an additional option for a subpopulation of patients   that do not tolerate or benefit from the current medications (Akbar et ai., 2009; Liaw, 2009; Peters, 2009; Wiegand, van Bommel, and Berg). In addition, the pregenomic R A eneapsidation inhibitors of the present invention may be effective on HBV variants that are resistant to the currently available DNA polymerase inhibitors (Zoiilim and Locamini, 2009). Further, combination therapies of the pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of the present invention with DNA polymerase inhibitors may syncrgisticaily suppress HBV replication and prevent the emergence of drag resistance, offering a safer and more effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B (Billioud et al., 201 i).

[0040] For the purposed of the present invention fused ring units, as well as spirocyclic rings, bicyclic rings and the like, which comprise a single heteroatom will be considered to belong to the cyclic family corresponding to the heteroatom containing ring. For example, 1,2,3,4- tetraliydroquinoline having the formula: <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000013_0001" />is, for the purposes of the present invention, considered a heterocyclic unit. 6,7-Dihydro-5H- cyelopentapyrimidine having the formula: <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000013_0002" />is, for the purposes of the present invention, considered a heteroaryl unit. When a fused ring unit contains heteroatoms in both a saturated and an aryl ring, the ar l ring will predominate and determine the type of category to which the ring is assigned. For example, 1 ,2,3,4-tetrahydro- [l,8]naphthyridine having the formula:   <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000014_0001" />    is, for the purposes of the present invention, considered a heteroaryl unit.      [0041] Whenever a term or either of their prefix roots appear in a name of a substituent the name is to be interpreted as including those limitations provided herein. For example, whenever the term "alkyl" or "aryl" or either of their prefix roots appear in a name of a substituent (e.g., aryialkyl, aikylamino) the name is to be interpreted as including those limitations given above for "alkyl" and "aryl."      [0042] The term "substituted" is used throughout the specification. The term "substituted" is defined herein as a moiety, whether acyclic or cyclic, which has one or more hydrogen atoms replaced by a substituent or several (e.g., 1 to 10) substituents as defined herein below. The substituents are capable of replacing one or two hydrogen atoms of a single moiety at a time. In addition, these substituents can replace two hydrogen atoms on two adjacent carbons to form said substituent, new moiety or unit. For example, a substituted unit that requires a single hydrogen atom replacement includes halogen, hydroxy!, and the like. A two hydrogen atom replacement includes carbonyl, oximino, and the like. A two hydrogen atom replacement from adjacent carbon atoms includes epoxy, and the like. The term "substituted" is used throughout the present specification to indicate that a moiety can have one or more of the hydrogen atoms replaced by a substituent. When a moiety is described as "substituted" any number of the hydrogen atoms may be replaced. For example, difluoromethyl is a substituted C5 alkyl; triffuoromethyi is a substituted Ci alkyl; 4- hydroxyphenyl is a substituted aromatic ring; (N,N-dimethyl-5-amino)ocianyl is a substituted <34 alkyl; 3-guanidinopropyl is a substituted C3 alkyl; and 2-carboxypyridinyl is a substituted heteroaryl      [0043] The variable groups defined herein, e.g., alkyl, aikenyl, alkynyi, cycioaikyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, aryl, Iieterocycle and heteroaryl groups defined herein, whether used alone or as part of another group, can be optionally substituted. Optionally substituted groups will be so indicated.      [0044] For the purposes of the present invention the terms "compound," "analog," and "composition of matter" stand equally well for the pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors described herein, including all enantiomeric forms, diastereomeric forms, salts, and the like, and the terms "compound," "analog," and "composition of matter" are used interchangeably throughout the present specification.

PROCEDURES      [0159] The following procedures can be utilized in evaluating and selecting compounds as the pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of HBV.      [0160] The HBV replication inhibitors of the present invention are capable of treating and preventing diseases associated with HBV infection. The results presented in Tables 5 to 9 demonstrated that compounds of the present invention inhibit HBV replication in an immortalized murine hepatocyte (AML 12)-derived stable cell line (AML12HBV 10) that supports robust HBV replication in a tetracycline inducible manner without measurable cytotoxicity up to 50  by using the standard MTT assay (Promega).      [0161] The antiviral efficacy of the compounds of the disclosure, as presented in Tables 5, 6,     7, 8 and 9, were determined in AML12HBV10 cells. AML12HBV10 is an immortalized murine hepatocyte (AML 12)-derived stable cell line that supports robust HBV replication in a tetracycline inducible manner (Xu et a!.). The cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a density of 2 x 10<4> cells per well and cultured in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of tetracycline to allow pgRNA transcription and HBV DNA replication. One day after seeding, cells were left untreated or treated with a serial dilution of testing compounds, ranging from 50  to 0.39 , for     48 hours. Cells were then lysed by adding into each well of 100  lysis buffer containing 10 mM     Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl and 1% NP-40 and incubated at 37 C for 30   minutes. Half amount (50 ) of cell lysate from each well was combined with equal volume of denaturing solution containing 0.5N NaOH and 1.5M NaCl. After 5 minute incubation, 100  of neutralization solution (1M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5M NaCl) was added into each well. The denatured cell lysates (totally 200 ) were applied onto Nylon membrane using 96-well dot-blot manifold (Biorad), HBV DNA in the cell lysates were determined by dot-blot hybridization with alpha-^P- UTP-labelled rlboprohe specific for HBV minus strand DNA. The antiviral efficacy of a compound of the disclosure was expressed as the concentration that reduces the amount of HBV DNA by 50% (EC'so).      [0162] Determination of cytotoxicity of compounds of the disclosure in AML12HBV10 cells: To determine the cytotoxicity of the compounds, AML12HBV10 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 2 x 10<4> cells per well and cultured in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of tetracycline to allow pgR A transcription and HBV DNA replication. One day after seeding, cells were left untreated or treated with a serial dilution of testing compounds, ranging from 50  to 0.39 , for 48 hours. The cell viability was measured by a MTT assay, following procedure provided by the manufacturer (Promega). The cytotoxicity of a compound was expressed as the concentration of compound that reduces the viability of the cells by 50% (CC50).      [0163] Determination of antiviral activity of compounds of the disclosure, as presented in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Table 10, in human hepatoma-derived cell lines: To further confirm the antiviral activity of the compounds of the disclosure against HBV in human hepatocyte-derived cells, HepDE819 cells, a human hepatoma cell line supporting HBV replication in a tetracycline inducible manner (Guo et ai., 2007), seeded into 12-weil plates at a density of 5 x 10<"> cells per well and cultured in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum and I g ml tetracycline. Two days after seeding, the cells were mock-treated or treated with a serial dilution of compounds of the disclosure, ranging from 10 , to 0,018 , for 6 days in the absence of tetracycline. Upon the completion of treatment, cells were lysed by adding into each well of the 12-weil plates 0,5 mi of lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 % NP40 and 2% sucrose and incubating at 37C for 10 minutes. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was mixed with 130  of 35% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 containing 1 ,5 M NaCl, After 1 hour incubation in ice. viral nucleocapsids were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 X g for 5 min at 4C, followed by 1 hour digestion at 3TC in 400  of digestion buffer containing 0.5 mg ml pronase   (Calbiochem), 0.5% 5DS, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mM EDTA. The digestion mixture was extracted twice with phenol and DNA was precipitated with etbanol, dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.1 mM EDTA). One half of the DNA sample from each well was resolved by electrophoresis into a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was then subjected to denaturation in a solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl, followed by neutralization in a buffer containing 1 M Tris-HCl (pH7.4) and 1.5 M NaCl. DNA was then blotted onto Hybond-XL membrane (OE Health care) in 20X SSC buffer. The amounts of cytoplasmic HBV core-associated HBV DNA were determined by Southern blot hybridization and the antiviral efficacy of a compound was expressed as its concentration that reduce the amount of HBV DNA by 50% (ECso) or 90% (EC*,).      [0164] Determination of cytotoxicity of compounds of the disclosure in human hepatoma- derived ceil lines, HepDES19 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 6 x 10<'*> cells per well and cultured in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of tetracycline. One day after seeding, cells were left untreated or treated with a serial dilution of testing compounds, ranging from 50  to 0.39 , for 6 days. The cell viability was measured by a MTT assay, following procedure provided by the manufacturer (Promega). The cytotoxicity of a compound was expressed as the concentration of compound that reduces the viability of the cells by 50% (CC50).      [0165] Antiviral efficacy of the selective compounds of the disclosure in HepDES 19 cells is presented in Figure. 1. A side-by-side comparison of the antiviral efficacy between DVR23 and two known anti-HBV compounds, lamivudine and Bay 1-41 9 is presented in Figure 2. A summary of the antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity of representative compounds of the disclosure in AML12HBV10 and HepDES19 cells is presented in Table 10. These results clearly demonstrate that the compounds of the disclosure selectively inhibit HBV replication not only in murine hepatocyte- derived cell line (AML12HBV 10), but also in human hepatocyte-derived cell Uine (HepDES l 9). The results also demonstrate that DVR-26 inhibits HBV DNA replication at a similar efficacy of lamivudine and Bay 41 -4109.      [0166]To obtain mechanistic insight of the compounds of present invention against HBV,     AML12HBV10 cells cultured in the 12-well plates were treated with a series of concentrations of     DVR-1 , DVR-56 or DVR-23 for two days in the absence of tetracycline (Guo et a!., 2007). As positive controls, the ceils were also treated with Bay41-4109 (5 iiM) or AT-61 (25 ), the known     HBV nucleocapsid assembly effectors that either bind to HBV core protein dimmer to misdirect its   interaction and prevent capsid formation (Bay41-4109) (Deres et al,, 2.003; Stray and Zlotnick, 2006), or interact with a core assembly intermediate and promote the formation of empty capsids (AT-63 ) (Feld et al., 2007; Katen et al, ; King et al., 1998). The amounts of intracellular viral mRNA, encapsidated pgRNA, capsids and nucleocapsid-associated HBV DNA were analyzed with the methods detailed below,      [0167] Procedure for analysis of HBV mRNA: Upon the completion of treatment, total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). Five micrograms of total RNA was resolved in 1.5% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formadelhyde and transferred onto Hybond-XL membrane in 20X SSC buffer. The amounts of HBV mRNA were determined by Northern blot hybridization with an alpha-"P-UTP labeled riboprobe specific for plus strand of HBV genome.      [0168]Determination of encapsidated pgRNA: AML12HBV10 cells were fysed by addition of 600  of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40) into each well of 12-well plates. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 5,000g for 10 minutes. One-half of the sample was mixed with 6 U of micrococcal nuclease (Pharmacia) and 15  of 100 mM CaCl2 and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 C to digest free nucleic acids. The reaction was stopped with 6  of 0.5 M EDTA, and capsids were precipitated by adding 125  of 35% polyethylene glycol 8000 in 1.75 M NaCl to the reaction and incubating in ice for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 6,000g for 10 minutes at 4 C. Pellets were re-suspended in 50  of TNE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). pgRNA was extracted by the addition of 1 ml of Trizol reagent. The encapsidated pgRNA were efectrophoresed through a 2.2 M formaldehyde- 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and immobilized by UV cross- linking (Stratagene). Hybridization was performed with an aipha-<" '>P-UTP labeled riboprobe specific for plus strand of HBV genome,      [0169] Procedures of viral capsids and nucleocapsid-associated DNA analysis: HepDESi9 cells were lysed by addition of 300  buffer containing lOmM Tris-HCl (pH7.6), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% NP-40 to each well of 12-well plate. Cell debries were removed by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 minutes. Ten microliters of the clarified ceil lysates were fractionated by electrophoresis through nondenaturing 1% agarose gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter by blotting with TNE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.6; 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA). HBV capsids were detected by probing the membrane with an antibody against HBV core protein (DAKO). Bound antibody was revealed by IRDye secondary antibobies and visualized by Li-COR Odyssey system,   To detect capsid associated HBV DNA, the membrane were treated with buffer containing 0.5N NaOH and 1.5 M NaCI for 5 minutes and followed by neutralization with buffer containing 1 M TRIS-HCl and 1.5M NaCI for 5 minutes. The viral DNA was detected by hybridization with a a-<32>P- UTP (800Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer) labeled minus strand specific full-length HBV riboprobe (Xu et ai.).      [0170] To analyze the HBV DNA replication intermediates, cells were iysed by adding into each well of the 12-well plates 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 % NP40 and 2% sucrose and incubating at 37C for 10 minutes. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was mixed with 130  of 35% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 containing 1.5 M NaCI. After I hour incubation in ice, viral nucieocapsids were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 X g for 5 minutes at 4C, followed by 1 hour digestion at 37 C in 400  of digestion buffer containing 0.5 mg ml pronase (Calbiochem), 0.5% SDS, 150 mM NaCI, 25 mM Tris- HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mM EDTA. The digestion mixture was extracted twice with phenol and DNA was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.1 mM EDTA). One half of the DNA sample from each well was resolved by electrophoresis into a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was then subjected to denatixration in a solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCI, followed by neutralization in a buffer containing 1 M Tris-HCl (pH7.4) and 1.5 M NaCI, DNA was then blotted onto Hybond-XL membrane (GE Health care) in 20X SSC buffer. The HBV DNA replication intermediates were probed with an a1pba-"p~UTP labeled riboprobe specific for minus strand of HBV genome.      [0171JAs shown in Figure 3, DVR- 1, DVR- 56 and DVR-23 did not affect the amount of viral mRNA (panel A), but dose-dependently reduced the level of encapsidated pgRNA (Panel C). However, consistent with the proposed mechanism, particle gel assay reveled that Bay41 -41 9 treatment completely abolished capsid formation (panel B) and thus pgRNA encapsidation and DNA synthesis (panels C, D and E), AT-61 treatment did not affect capsid formation (panel B), but dose- dependently reduced the amounts of encapsidated pgRNA (panel C) and the capsid-associated HBV DNA (panels D and E). Similar to AT-61 , DVR compounds did not significantly affect capsid formation (panel B), but reduced encapsidated pgRNA and capsid-associated HBV DNA in a dose- dependent mariner (panels C, D and E). The above results imply that phenotypicaliy similar with AT- 61, the DVR compounds inhibited pgRNA encapsidateion into nucieocapsids and resulted in   formation of empty capsids. As a consequence, the subsequent HBV DNA replication could not occur.      ) by dot blot hybridization and cellular toxicity (CC50) of compound      <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000048_0001" /><img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000048_0003" />    Table 6; Antiviral activity (EC50) by dot blot hybridization and cellular toxicity (CC5 ) of compounds of the formula (VI):      <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000048_0002" /><img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000048_0004" /><img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000049_0001" /><img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000050_0001" /><img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000051_0001" /><img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000052_0001" /><img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000053_0001" />    Table 7: Antiviral activity (EC5o) by dot blot hybridization and cellular toxicity (CCSo) of compounds of the formula (II): <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000053_0002" />    <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000053_0003" /><img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000054_0001" />    Table 8: Antiviral activity (EC5o) by dot blot hybridization and cellular toxicity (CCSo) of compounds of the formula (ill): <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000054_0002" />    <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000054_0003" />DVR-08 CH3 44 >50      DVR-09 CH3 33 >50      DVR-10 H 49 >50      DVR-1 1 Br 13,2 >50      Table 9; Antiviral activity (EC50) by dot blot hybridization and cellular toxicity (CC50) of compounds of the formula (IV):      <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000055_0001" /><img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000055_0003" />    Table 10: Antiviral activity of exemplary compounds of the formula (II) in AML12HBV10 and HepDES 19 cells:      <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000055_0002" />    AML12HBVI0 HepDES 19      Compound R<x>      EC50 CCso EC50 EC90 CCso  <img class="EMIRef" id="113682681-imgf000056_0001" />
