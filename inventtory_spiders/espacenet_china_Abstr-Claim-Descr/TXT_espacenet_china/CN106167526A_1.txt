RSPO BINDING AGENTS AND USES THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention      [0001] The field of this invention generally relates to antibodies and other agents that bind R-Spondin proteins (RSPO), particularly human R-Spondin proteins including RSPOl, RSP02 and RSP03, as well as to methods of using the antibodies or other agents for the treatment of diseases such as cancer.      Background of the Invention      [0002] The R-Spondin (RSPO) family of proteins is conserved among vertebrates and comprises four members, RSPOl, RSP02, RSP03 and RSP04. These proteins have been referred to by a variety of names, including roof plate-specific spondins, hPWTSR (hRSP03), THS2D (RSP03), Cristin 1-4, and Futrin 1-4. The RSPOs are small secreted proteins that overall share approximately 40-60% sequence homology and domain organization. All RSPO proteins contain two furin-like cysteine-rich domains at the N- terminus followed by a thrombospondin domain and a basic charged C-terminal tail (Kim et al, 2006, Cell Cycle, 5:23-26).      [0003] Studies have shown that RSPO proteins have a role during vertebrate development     (Kamata et al., 2004, Biochim. Biophys Acta, 1676:51-62) and in Xenopus myogenesis (Kazanskaya et al., 2004, Dev. Cell, 7:525-534). RSPOl has also been shown to function as a potent mitogen for gastrointestinal epithelial cells (Kim et al., 2005, Science, 309:1256-1259). RSPO proteins are known to activate -catenin signaling similar to Wnt signaling, however the relationship between RSPO proteins and Wnt signaling is still being investigated. It has been reported that RSPO proteins possess a positive modulatory activity on Wnt ligands (Nam et al, 2006, JBC 281 :13247-57). This study also reported that RSPO proteins could function as Frizzled8 and LRP6 receptor ligands and induce -catenin signaling (Nam et al., 2006, JBC 281 :13247-57). Recent studies have identified an interaction between RSPO proteins and LGR (leucine-rich repeat containing, G protein-coupler receptor) proteins, such as LGR5 (U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2009/0074782 and 2009/0191205), and these data present an alternative pathway for the activation of -catenin signaling.      [0004] The Wnt signaling pathway has been identified as a potential target for cancer therapy. The Wnt signaling pathway is one of several critical regulators of embryonic pattern formation, post-embryonic tissue maintenance, and stem cell biology. More specifically, Wnt signaling plays an important role in the generation of cell polarity and cell fate specification including self-renewal by stem cell populations. Unregulated activation of the Wnt pathway is associated with numerous human cancers where it is believed the activation can alter the developmental fate of cells. The activation of the Wnt pathway may maintain tumor cells in an undifferentiated state and/or lead to uncontrolled proliferation. Thus carcinogenesis can proceed by overtaking homeostatic mechanisms which control normal development and tissue repair (reviewed in Reya & Clevers, 2005, Nature, 434:843-50; Beachy et al, 2004, Nature, 432:324-31).      [0005] The Wnt signaling pathway was first elucidated in the Drosophila developmental mutant wingless (wg) and from the murine proto-oncogene int-1, now Wntl (Nusse & Varmus, 1982, Cell, 31 :99-109; Van Ooyen & Nusse, 1984, Cell, 39:233-40; Cabrera et al., 1987, Cell, 50:659-63; Rijsewijk et al., 1987, Cell, 50:649-57). Wnt genes encode secreted lipid-modified glycoproteins of which 19 have been identified in mammals. These secreted ligands activate a receptor complex consisting of a Frizzled (FZD) receptor family member and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6). The FZD receptors are seven transmembrane domain proteins of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and contain a large extracellular N-terminal ligand binding domain with 10 conserved cysteines, known as a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) or Fri domain. There are ten human FZD receptors, FZD1, FZD2, FZD3, FZD4, FZD5, FZD6, FZD7, FZD8, FZD9, and FZD 10. Different FZD CRDs have different binding affinities for specific Wnt proteins (Wu & Nusse, 2002, J Biol. Chem., 277:41762-9), and FZD receptors have been grouped into those that activate the canonical -catenin pathway and those that activate non-canonical pathways (Miller et al., 1999, Oncogene, 18:7860- 72).      [0006] A role for Wnt signaling in cancer was first uncovered with the identification of     Wntl (originally intl) as an oncogene in mammary tumors transformed by the nearby insertion of a murine virus (Nusse & Varmus, 1982, Cell, 31 :99-109). Additional evidence for the role of Wnt signaling in breast cancer has since accumulated. For instance, transgenic over-expression of -catenin in the mammary glands results in hyperplasias and adenocarcinomas (Imbert et al., 2001, J Cell Biol., 153:555-68; Michaelson & Leder, 2001, Oncogene, 20:5093-9) whereas loss of Wnt signaling disrupts normal mammary gland development (Tepera et al., 2003, J Cell Sci., 116: 1137-49; Hatsell et al., 2003, J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia, 8:145-58). In human breast cancer, -catenin accumulation implicates activated Wnt signaling in over 50% of carcinomas, and though specific mutations have not been identified, up-regulation of Frizzled receptor expression has been observed (Brennan & Brown, 2004, J Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia, 9:1 19-31 ; Malovanovic et al., 2004, Int. J Oncol, 25: 1337-42).      [0007] Activation of the Wnt pathway is also associated with colorectal cancer.      Approximately 5-10% of all colorectal cancers are hereditary with one of the main forms being familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant disease in which about 80%) of affected individuals contain a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Mutations have also been identified in other Wnt pathway components including Axin and -catenin. Individual adenomas are clonal outgrowths of epithelial cells containing a second inactivated allele, and the large number of FAP adenomas inevitably results in the development of adenocarcinomas through additional mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, including loss-of-function mutations in APC and stabilizing mutations in -catenin, can induce hyperplastic development and tumor growth in mouse models (Oshima et al., 1997, Cancer Res., 57:1644-9; Harada et al., 1999, EMBO J, 18:5931-42).      [0008] Similar to breast cancer and colon cancer, melanoma often has constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway, as indicated by the nuclear accumulation of -catenin. Activation of the<img class="EMIRef" id="115441282-imgf000004_0001" />pathway in some melanoma tumors and cell lines is due to modifications in pathway components, such as APC, ICAT, LEF1 and -catenin (see e.g., Larue et al. 2006, Frontiers Biosci., 1 1 :733-742). However, there are conflicting reports in the literature as to the exact role of<img class="EMIRef" id="115441282-imgf000004_0002" />signaling in melanoma. For example, one study found that elevated levels of nuclear -catenin correlated with improved survival from melanoma, and that activated Wnt/p-catenin signaling was associated with decreased cell proliferation (Chien et al, 2009, PNAS, 106: 1 193-1198).      [0009] The focus of cancer drug research is shifting toward targeted therapies aimed at genes, proteins, and pathways involved in human cancer. There is a need for new agents targeting signaling pathways and new combinations of agents that target multiple pathways that could provide therapeutic benefit for cancer patients. Thus, biomolecules (e.g., anti-RSPO antibodies) that disrupt -catenin signaling are a potential source of new therapeutic agents for cancer, as well as other -catenin-associated diseases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION      [0060] The present invention provides novel agents, including, but not limited to polypeptides such as antibodies, that bind RSPO proteins (e.g., human RSPOl, RSP02, and/or RSP03). The RSPO-binding agents include antagonists of -catenin signaling. Related polypeptides and polynucleotides, compositions comprising the RSPO-binding agents, and methods of making the RSPO-binding agents are also provided. Methods of using the novel RSPO-binding agents, such as methods of inhibiting tumor growth, methods of treating cancer, methods of reducing the frequency of cancer stem cells in a tumor, methods of inhibiting -catenin signaling, and/or methods of identifying and/or selecting subjects for treatment, are further provided.      [0061] Monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind human RSPOl have been identified - monoclonal antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, 89M7, 89M19 and 89M25 (Example 5, Fig. 5). Anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, and 89M25 inhibit -catenin signaling (Example 6, Fig. 6). Anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, and 89M25 block soluble RSPOl binding to LGR5 (Example 7, Fig. 7). Sequence data subsequently demonstrated that antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, and 89M25 contain the same heavy chain and light chain variable regions, and it was concluded that these antibodies would comprise the same antigen-binding site. Anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M4, 89M5, 89M7 and 89M25 have binding affinities for both human and mouse RSPOl of less than 0.1 nM (Example 8). A humanized version of 89M5 was produced, h89M5-H2L2 (Example 19) and has a binding affinity for human RSPOl of less than 0.1 nM (Example 20). Anti- RSPOl antibodies 89M5 and 89M25 have been found to inhibit tumor cell growth in vivo in an ovarian tumor xenograft model as single agents and in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent (Example 9, Fig. 8). Anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth in vivo in a pancreatic tumor xenograft model in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent (Example 17, Fig. 15). Preliminary epitope mapping studies suggest that amino acids within the furin2 domain of RSPOl are involved in the binding site for anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 (Example 10, Fig. 9).      [0062] In addition, monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind human RSP02 have been identified monoclonal antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 (Example 1 1, Fig. 10). Anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 were shown to reduce or completely block -catenin signaling (Example 12, Fig. 11). Anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23 and 130M24 block soluble RSP02 binding to LGR5 (Example 13, Fig. 12). Anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 has a binding affinity for human RSP02 of 0.14nM and mouse RSP02 of 0.35nM (Example 15). Humanized versions of 130M23 were produced, hl30M23-HlL2 and hl30M23-HlL6 (Example 19). Anti-RSP02 antibody hl30M23-HlL2 has a binding affinity for human RSP02 of 0.13nM and hl30M23-HlL6 has a binding affinity for human RSP02 of 0.15nM (Example 20). Anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth in vivo in a pancreatic tumor xenograft model as a single agent and in combination with additional therapeutic agents (Examples 17 and 18, Figs. 15 and 16).      I. Definitions      [0063] To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and phrases are defined below. [0064] The terms "antagonist" and "antagonistic" as used herein refer to any molecule that partially or fully blocks, inhibits, reduces or neutralizes a biological activity of a target and/or signaling pathway (e.g., the -catenin signaling). The term "antagonist" is used herein to include any molecule that partially or fully blocks, inhibits, reduces or neutralizes the activity of a protein (e.g., a RSPO protein). Suitable antagonist molecules specifically include, but are not limited to, antagonist antibodies or antibody fragments.      [0065] The terms "modulation" and "modulate" as used herein refer to a change or an alteration in a biological activity. Modulation includes, but is not limited to, stimulating or inhibiting an activity. Modulation may be an increase or a decrease in activity (e.g., a decrease in RSPO signaling; a decrease in -catenin signaling), a change in binding characteristics, or any other change in the biological, functional, or immunological properties associated with the activity of a protein, pathway, or other biological point of interest.      [0066] The term "antibody" as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin molecule that recognizes and specifically binds a target, such as a protein, polypeptide, peptide, carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, or combinations of the foregoing, through at least one antigen recognition site within the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term encompasses intact polyclonal antibodies, intact monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments), single chain Fv (scFv) antibodies, multispecific antibodies such as bispecific antibodies generated from at least two intact antibodies, monospecific antibodies, monovalent antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, fusion proteins comprising an antigen determination portion of an antibody, and any other modified immunoglobulin molecule comprising an antigen recognition site as long as the antibodies exhibit the desired biological activity. An antibody can be any of the five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, or subclasses (isotypes) thereof (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2), based on the identity of their heavy-chain constant domains referred to as alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The different classes of immunoglobulins have different and well-known subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations. Antibodies can be naked or conjugated to other molecules, including but not limited to, toxins and radioisotopes. [0067] The term "antibody fragment" refers to a portion of an intact antibody and refers to the antigenic determining variable regions of an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments, linear antibodies, single chain antibodies, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. "Antibody fragment" as used herein comprises an antigen-binding site or epitope binding site.      [0068] The term "variable region" of an antibody refers to the variable region of the antibody light chain, or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. The variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR) connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs), also known as "hypervariable regions". The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the framework regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding sites of the antibody. There are at least two techniques for determining CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Edition, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD.), and (2) an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997, J Mol. Biol, 273:927-948). In addition, combinations of these two approaches are sometimes used in the art to determine CDRs.      [0069] The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to a homogenous antibody population involved in the highly specific recognition and binding of a single antigenic determinant or epitope. This is in contrast to polyclonal antibodies that typically include a mixture of different antibodies directed against different antigenic determinants. The term "monoclonal antibody" encompasses both intact and full-length monoclonal antibodies as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv), single chain (scFv) antibodies, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified immunoglobulin molecule comprising an antigen recognition site (antigen-binding site). Furthermore, "monoclonal antibody" refers to such antibodies made by any number of techniques, including but not limited to, hybridoma production, phage selection, recombinant expression, and transgenic animals. [0070] The term "humanized antibody" as used herein refers to forms of non-human     (e.g., murine) antibodies that are specific immunoglobulin chains, chimeric immunoglobulins, or fragments thereof that contain minimal non-human sequences. Typically, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins in which residues of the CDRs are replaced by residues from the CDRs of a non-human species (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, or hamster) that have the desired specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability (Jones et al., 1986, Nature, 321 :522-525; Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature, 332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science, 239: 1534-1536). In some instances, the Fv framework region residues of a human immunoglobulin are replaced with the corresponding residues in an antibody from a non-human species that has the desired specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability. The humanized antibody can be further modified by the substitution of additional residues either in the Fv framework region and/or within the replaced non- human residues to refine and optimize antibody specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two or three, variable domains containing all or substantially all of the CDRs that correspond to the non-human immunoglobulin whereas all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody can also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Examples of methods used to generate humanized antibodies are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. 5,225,539.      [0071] The term "human antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody produced by a human or an antibody having an amino acid sequence corresponding to an antibody produced by a human made using any of the techniques known in the art. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.      [0072] The term "chimeric antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody wherein the amino acid sequence of the immunoglobulin molecule is derived from two or more species. Typically, the variable region of both light and heavy chains corresponds to the variable region of antibodies derived from one species of mammals (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, etc.) with the desired specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability, while the constant regions are homologous to the sequences in antibodies derived from another species (usually human) to avoid eliciting an immune response in that species.      [0073] The phrase "affinity matured antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alterations(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. For example, Marks et al., 1992, Bio/Technology 10:779- 783, describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by Barbas et al., 1994, PNAS, 91 :3809-3813; Schier et al., 1995, Gene, 169: 147-155; Yelton et al., 1995, J Immunol. 155:1994-2004; Jackson et al., 1995, J. Immunol, 154:3310-9; and Hawkins et al., 1992, J Mol. Biol, 226:889-896.      [0074] The terms "epitope" and "antigenic determinant" are used interchangeably herein and refer to that portion of an antigen capable of being recognized and specifically bound by a particular antibody. When the antigen is a polypeptide, epitopes can be formed both from contiguous amino acids and noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids (also referred to as linear epitopes) are typically retained upon protein denaturing, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding (also referred to as conformational epitopes) are typically lost upon protein denaturing. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation.      [0075] The terms "selectively binds" or "specifically binds" mean that a binding agent or an antibody reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration, with greater affinity, or with some combination of the above to the epitope, protein or target molecule than with alternative substances, including unrelated proteins. In certain embodiments "specifically binds" means, for instance, that an antibody binds a protein with a D of about 0.1 mM or less, but more usually less than about  . In certain embodiments, "specifically binds" means that an antibody binds a target at times with a KD of at least about 0.1  or less, at other times at least about 0.01  or less, and at other times at least about InM or less. Because of the sequence identity between homologous proteins in different species, specific binding can include an antibody that recognizes a protein in more than one species (e.g., human RSPOl and mouse RSPOl). Likewise, because of homology within certain regions of polypeptide sequences of different proteins, specific binding can include an antibody (or other polypeptide or binding agent) that recognizes more than one protein (e.g., human RSPOl and human RSP02). It is understood that, in certain embodiments, an antibody or binding moiety that specifically binds a first target may or may not specifically bind a second target. As such, "specific binding" does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding, i.e. binding to a single target. Thus, an antibody may, in certain embodiments, specifically bind more than one target. In certain embodiments, multiple targets may be bound by the same antigen-binding site on the antibody. For example, an antibody may, in certain instances, comprise two identical antigen-binding sites, each of which specifically binds the same epitope on two or more proteins (e.g., RSPOl and RSP02). In certain alternative embodiments, an antibody may be bispecific or multispecific and comprise at least two antigen-binding sites with differing specificities. By way of non- limiting example, a bispecific antibody may comprise one antigen-binding site that recognizes an epitope on one protein (e.g., human RSPOl) and further comprise a second, different antigen-binding site that recognizes a different epitope on a second protein. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means specific binding.      [0076] The terms "polypeptide" and "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably herein and refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids), as well as other modifications known in the art. It is understood that, because the polypeptides of this invention may be based upon antibodies, in certain embodiments, the polypeptides can occur as single chains or associated chains. jj0077] The terms "polynucleotide" and "nucleic acid" are used interchangeably herein and refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or R A polymerase.      "Conditions of high stringency" may be identified by those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 15mM sodium chloride/ 1.5 mM sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50C; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/5 OmM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750mM sodium chloride, 75mM sodium citrate at 42C; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5x SSC (0.75M NaCl, 75mM sodium citrate), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5x Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50g/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42C, with washes at 42C in 0.2x SSC and 50% formamide at 55C, followed by a high- stringency wash consisting of 0.1 x SSC containing EDTA at 55C.      The terms "identical" or percent "identity" in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptides, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned (introducing gaps, if necessary) for maximum correspondence, not considering any conservative amino acid substitutions as part of the sequence identity. The percent identity may be measured using sequence comparison software or algorithms or by visual inspection. Various algorithms and software that may be used to obtain alignments of amino acid or nucleotide sequences are well-known in the art. These include, but are not limited to, BLAST, ALIGN, Megalign, BestFit, GCG Wisconsin Package, and variants thereof. In some embodiments, two nucleic acids or polypeptides of the invention are substantially identical, meaning they have at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, and in some embodiments at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%), 99% nucleotide or amino acid residue identity, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using a sequence comparison algorithm or by visual inspection. In some embodiments, identity exists over a region of the sequences that is at least about 10, at least about 20, at least about 40-60 residues, at least about 60-80 residues in length or any integral value therebetween. In some embodiments, identity exists over a longer region than 60-80 residues, such as at least about 80-100 residues, and in some embodiments the sequences are substantially identical over the full length of the sequences being compared, such as the coding region of a nucleotide sequence.      [0080] A "conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which one amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). For example, substitution of a phenylalanine for a tyrosine is a conservative substitution. Preferably, conservative substitutions in the sequences of the polypeptides and antibodies of the invention do not abrogate the binding of the polypeptide or antibody containing the amino acid sequence, to the antigen(s), i.e., the one or more RSPO protein(s) to which the polypeptide or antibody binds. Methods of identifying nucleotide and amino acid conservative substitutions which do not eliminate antigen binding are well-known in the art.      [0081] The term "vector" as used herein means a construct, which is capable of delivering, and usually expressing, one or more gene(s) or sequence(s) of interest in a host cell. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, viral vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, plasmid, cosmid, or phage vectors, DNA or RNA expression vectors associated with cationic condensing agents, and DNA or RNA expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes.      [0082] A polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell, or composition which is     "isolated" is a polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell, or composition which is in a form not found in nature. Isolated polypeptides, antibodies, polynucleotides, vectors, cells or compositions include those which have been purified to a degree that they are no longer in a form in which they are found in nature. In some embodiments, a polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell, or composition which is isolated is substantially pure. [0083] The term "substantially pure" as used herein refers to material which is at least     50% pure (i.e., free from contaminants), at least 90% pure, at least 95% pure, at least 98% pure, or at least 99% pure.      [0084] The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" as used herein refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals in which a population of cells are characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and hematologic cancers such as lymphoma and leukemia.      [0085] The terms "tumor" and "neoplasm" as used herein refer to any mass of tissue that results from excessive cell growth or proliferation, either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous) including pre-cancerous lesions.      [0086] The term "metastasis" as used herein refers to the process by which a cancer spreads or transfers from the site of origin to other regions of the body with the development of a similar cancerous lesion at the new location. A "metastatic" or "metastasizing" cell is one that loses adhesive contacts with neighboring cells and migrates via the bloodstream or lymph from the primary site of disease to invade neighboring body structures.      [0087] The terms "cancer stem cell" and "CSC" and "tumor stem cell" and "tumor initiating cell" are used interchangeably herein and refer to cells from a cancer or tumor that: (1) have extensive proliferative capacity; 2) are capable of asymmetric cell division to generate one or more types of differentiated cell progeny wherein the differentiated cells have reduced proliferative or developmental potential; and (3) are capable of symmetric cell divisions for self-renewal or self-maintenance. These properties confer on the cancer stem cells the ability to form or establish a tumor or cancer upon serial transplantation into an immunocompromised host (e.g., a mouse) compared to the majority of tumor cells that fail to form tumors. Cancer stem cells undergo self-renewal versus differentiation in a chaotic manner to form tumors with abnormal cell types that can change over time as mutations occur.      [0088] The terms "cancer cell" and "tumor cell" refer to the total population of cells derived from a cancer or tumor or pre-cancerous lesion, including both non-tumorigenic cells, which comprise the bulk of the cancer cell population, and tumorigenic stem cells (cancer stem cells). As used herein, the terms "cancer cell" or "tumor cell" will be modified by the term "non-tumorigenic" when referring solely to those cells lacking the capacity to renew and differentiate to distinguish those tumor cells from cancer stem cells.      [0089] The term "tumorigenic" as used herein refers to the functional features of a cancer stem cell including the properties of self-renewal (giving rise to additional tumorigenic cancer stem cells) and proliferation to generate all other tumor cells (giving rise to differentiated and thus non-tumorigenic tumor cells).      [0090] The term "tumorigenicity" as used herein refers to the ability of a random sample of cells from the tumor to form palpable tumors upon serial transplantation into immunocompromised hosts (e.g., mice).      [0091] The term "subject" refers to any animal (e.g., a mammal), including, but not limited to, humans, non-human primates, canines, felines, rodents, and the like, which is to be the recipient of a particular treatment. Typically, the terms "subject" and "patient" are used interchangeably herein in reference to a human subject.      [0092] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to approved or approvable by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans.      [0093] The terms "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier or adjuvant" or     "acceptable pharmaceutical carrier" refer to an excipient, carrier or adjuvant that can be administered to a subject, together with at least one binding agent (e.g., an antibody) of the present disclosure, and which does not destroy the pharmacological activity thereof and is nontoxic when administered in doses sufficient to deliver a therapeutic effect.      [0094] The terms "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" or     "therapeutic effect" refer to an amount of a binding agent, an antibody, polypeptide, polynucleotide, small organic molecule, or other drug effective to "treat" a disease or disorder in a subject or mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of a drug (e.g., an antibody) has a therapeutic effect and as such can reduce the number of cancer cells; decrease tumorigenicity, tumorigenic frequency or tumorigenic capacity; reduce the number or frequency of cancer stem cells; reduce the tumor size; reduce the cancer cell population; inhibit or stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs including, for example, the spread of cancer into soft tissue and bone; inhibit and stop tumor or cancer cell metastasis; inhibit and stop tumor or cancer cell growth; relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer; reduce morbidity and mortality; improve quality of life; or a combination of such effects. To the extent the agent, for example an antibody, prevents growth and/or kills existing cancer cells, it can be referred to as cytostatic and/or cytotoxic.      [0095] The terms "treating" or "treatment" or "to treat" or "alleviating" or "to alleviate" refer to both 1) therapeutic measures that cure, slow down, lessen symptoms of, and/or halt progression of a diagnosed pathologic condition or disorder and 2) prophylactic or preventative measures that prevent or slow the development of a targeted pathologic condition or disorder. Thus those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder; those prone to have the disorder; and those in whom the disorder is to be prevented. In some embodiments, a subject is successfully "treated" according to the methods of the present invention if the patient shows one or more of the following: a reduction in the number of or complete absence of cancer cells; a reduction in the tumor size; inhibition of or an absence of cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs including the spread of cancer cells into soft tissue and bone; inhibition of or an absence of tumor or cancer cell metastasis; inhibition or an absence of cancer growth; relief of one or more symptoms associated with the specific cancer; reduced morbidity and mortality; improvement in quality of life; reduction in tumorigenicity; reduction in the number or frequency of cancer stem cells; or some combination of effects.      [0096] As used in the present disclosure and claims, the singular forms "a", "an" and     "the" include plural forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.      [0097] It is understood that wherever embodiments are described herein with the language "comprising" otherwise analogous embodiments described in terms of "consisting of and/or "consisting essentially of are also provided.      [0098] The term "and/or" as used in a phrase such as "A and/or B" herein is intended to include both A and B; A or B; A (alone); and B (alone). Likewise, the term "and/or" as used in a phrase such as "A, B, and/or C" is intended to encompass each of the following embodiments: A, B, and C; A, B, or C; A or C; A or B; B or C: A and C; A and B; B and C; A (alone); B (alone); and C (alone),      II.

In some embodiments, the antibody is a chimeric antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody is a humanized antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody is a human antibody. In certain embodiments, the antibody is an IgGl antibody. In certain embodiments, the antibody is an lgG2 antibody.

In some embodiments, the antibody is isolated. In some embodiments, the antibody is substantially pure,      [0110] The RSPO-binding agents (e.g., antibodies) of the present invention can be assayed for specific binding by any method known in the art. The immunoassays that can be used include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as Biacore analysis, FACS analysis, immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, Western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA, "sandwich" immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitation reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, and protein A immunoassays. Such assays are routine and well-known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al.. Editors, 1994-present, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY).      [0111] For example, the specific binding of an antibody to human RSPOl may be determined using ELISA. An ELISA assay comprises preparing antigen, coating wells of a 96 well microtiter plate with antigen, adding the RSPOl -binding antibody or other RSPOl -binding agent conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well, incubating for a period of time and detecting the presence of the antibody bound to the antigen. In some embodiments, the RSPOl -binding antibody or agent is not conjugated to a detectable compound, but instead a second conjugated antibody that recognizes the RSPOl -binding antibody or agent is added to the well. In some embodiments, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the RSPO-binding antibody or agent can be coated to the well and a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound can be added following the addition of the antigen to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELIS As known in the art.      [0112] In another example, the specific binding of an antibody to human RSPOl may be determined using FACS. A FACS screening assay may comprise generating a cDNA construct that expresses an antigen as a fusion protein (e.g., RSPOl-Fc or RSPOl- CD4TM), transfecting the construct into cells, expressing the antigen on the surface of the cells, mixing the RSPOl -binding antibody or other RSPOl -binding agent with the transfected cells, and incubating for a period of time. The cells bound by the RSPOl - binding antibody or other RSPO-binding agent may be identified by using a secondary antibody conjugated to a detectable compound (e.g., PE-conjugated anti-Fc antibody) and a flow cytometer. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to optimize the signal detected as well as other variations of FACS that may enhance screening (e.g., screening for blocking antibodies).      [0113] The binding affinity of an antibody or other binding-agent to an antigen (e.g., a     RSPO protein) and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., <3>H or <125>I), or fragment or variant thereof, with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen followed by the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody for an antigen (e.g., a RSPO protein) and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. In some embodiments, Biacore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies or agents that bind an antigen (e.g., a RSPO protein). Biacore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of antibodies from chips with immobilized antigen (e.g., a RSPO protein) on their surface.

In certain embodiments, a RSP02-binding agent comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of, the antibody hl30M23-HlL6.      [0141] Many proteins, including antibodies, contain a signal sequence that directs the transport of the proteins to various locations. Signal sequences (also referred to as signal peptides or leader sequences) are located at the N-terminus of nascent polypeptides. They target the polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum and the proteins are sorted to their destinations, for example, to the inner space of an organelle, to an interior membrane, to the cell's outer membrane, or to the cell exterior via secretion. Most signal sequences are cleaved from the protein by a signal peptidase after the proteins are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum. The cleavage of the signal sequence from the polypeptide usually occurs at a specific site in the amino acid sequence and is dependent upon amino acid residues within the signal sequence. Although there is usually one specific cleavage site, more than one cleavage site may be recognized and/or may be used by a signal peptidase resulting in a non-homogenous N-terminus of the polypeptide. For example, the use of different cleavage sites within a signal sequence can result in a polypeptide expressed with different N-terminal amino acids. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the polypeptides as described herein may comprise a mixture of polypeptides with different N-termini. In some embodiments, the N-termini differ in length by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 amino acids. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is substantially homogeneous, i.e., the polypeptides have the same N-terminus. In some embodiments, the signal sequence of the polypeptide comprises one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, etc.) amino acid substitutions and/or deletions as compared to a "native" or "parental" signal sequence, in some embodiments, the signal sequence of the polypeptide comprises amino acid substitutions and/or deletions that allow one cleavage site to be dominant, thereby resulting in a substantially homogeneous polypeptide with one N- terminus. In some embodiments, the signal sequence of the polypeptide is replaced with a different signal sequence. In some embodiments, a signal sequence of the polypeptide affects the expression level of the polypeptide. In some embodiments, a signal sequence of the polypeptide increases the expression level of the polypeptide. In some embodiments, a signal sequence of the polypeptide decreases the expression level of the polypeptide.

[0157] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody) inhibits - catenin signaling. It is understood that a RSPO-binding agent that inhibits -catenin signaling may, in certain embodiments, inhibit signaling by one or more receptors in the -catenin signaling pathway but not necessarily inhibit signaling by all receptors.

[0159] In vivo and in vitro assays for determining whether a RSPO-binding agent (or candidate RSPO-binding agent) inhibits -catenin signaling are known in the art. For example, cell-based, luciferase reporter assays utilizing a TCF/Luc reporter vector containing multiple copies of the TCF-binding domain upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene may be used to measure -catenin signaling levels in vitro (Gazit et al., 1999, Oncogene, 18; 5959-66; TOPflash, Millipore, Billerica MA). The level of - catenin signaling in the presence of one or more Wnts (e.g., Wnt(s) expressed by transfected cells or provided by Wnt-conditioned media) with or without a RSPO protein or RSPO-conditioned media in the presence of a RSPO-binding agent is compared to the level of signaling without the RSPO-binding agent present. In addition to the TCF/Luc reporter assay the effect of a RSPO-binding agent (or candidate agent) on -catenin signaling may be measured in vitro or in vivo by measuring the effect of the agent on the level of expression of -catenin-regulated genes, such as c-myc (He et al., 1998, Science, 281 :1509-12), cyclin Dl (Tetsu et al., 1999, Nature, 398:422-6) and/or fibronectin (Gradl et al. 1999, Mol. Cell Biol, 19:5576-87). In certain embodiments, the effect of a RSPO- binding agent on -catenin signaling may also be assessed by measuring the effect of the agent on the phosphorylation state of Dishevelled- 1, Dishevelled-2, Dishevelled-3, LRP5, LRP6, and/or -catenin.      [0160] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents have one or more of the following effects: inhibit proliferation of tumor cells, inhibit tumor growth, reduce the tumorigenicity of a tumor, reduce the tumorigenicity of a tumor by reducing the frequency of cancer stem cells in the tumor, inhibit tumor growth, trigger cell death of tumor cells, induce cells in a tumor to differentiate, differentiate tumorigenic cells to a non-tumorigenic state, induce expression of differentiation markers in the tumor cells, prevent metastasis of tumor cells, or decrease survival of tumor cells.      [0161] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents are capable of inhibiting tumor growth. In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents are capable of inhibiting tumor growth in vivo (e.g., in a xenograft mouse model, and/or in a human having cancer).      [0162] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents are capable of reducing the tumorigenicity of a tumor. In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent or antibody is capable of reducing the tumorigenicity of a tumor comprising cancer stem cells in an animal model, such as a mouse xenograft model. In certain embodiments, the number or frequency of cancer stem cells in a tumor is reduced by at least about two-fold, about three-fold, about five-fold, about ten-fold, about 50-fold, about 100-fold, or about 1000- fold. In certain embodiments, the reduction in the number or frequency of cancer stem cells is determined by limiting dilution assay using an animal model. Additional examples and guidance regarding the use of limiting dilution assays to determine a reduction in the number or frequency of cancer stem cells in a tumor can be found, e.g., in International Publication Number WO 2008/042236, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0064049, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0178305.      [0163] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents described herein have a circulating half-life in mice, cynomolgus monkeys, or humans of at least about 5 hours? at least about 10 hours, at least about 24 hours, at least about 3 days, at least about 1 week, or at least about 2 weeks. In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent is an IgG (e.g., IgGl or IgG2) antibody that has a circulating half-life in mice, cynomolgus monkeys, or humans of at least about 5 hours, at least about 10 hours, at least about 24 hours, at least about 3 days, at least about 1 week, or at least about 2 weeks. Methods of increasing (or decreasing) the half-life of agents such as polypeptides and antibodies are known in the art. For example, known methods of increasing the circulating half-life of IgG antibodies include the introduction of mutations in the Fc region which increase the pH-dependent binding of the antibody to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) at pH 6.0 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0276799, 2007/0148164, and 2007/0122403). Known methods of increasing the circulating half-life of antibody fragments lacking the Fc region include such techniques as PEGylation.      [0164] In some embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents are polyclonal antibodies.      Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared by any known method. In some embodiments, polyclonal antibodies are raised by immunizing an animal (e.g., a rabbit, rat, mouse, goat, donkey) by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of the relevant antigen (e.g., a purified peptide fragment, full-length recombinant protein, or fusion protein). The antigen can be optionally conjugated to a carrier such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or serum albumin. The antigen (with or without a carrier protein) is diluted in sterile saline and usually combined with an adjuvant (e.g., Complete or Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant) to form a stable emulsion. After a sufficient period of time, polyclonal antibodies are recovered from blood, ascites, and the like, of the immunized animal. The polyclonal antibodies can be purified from serum or ascites according to standard methods in the art including, but not limited to, affinity chromatography, ion- exchange chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and dialysis.      [0165] In some embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents are monoclonal antibodies.      Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma methods known to one of skill in the art (see e.g., Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature, 256:495-497). In some embodiments, using the hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is immunized as described above to elicit from lymphocytes the production of antibodies that will specifically bind the immunizing antigen. In some embodiments, lymphocytes can be immunized in vitro. In some embodiments, the immunizing antigen can be a human protein or a portion thereof. In some embodiments, the immunizing antigen can be a mouse protein or a portion thereof.      Following immunization, lymphocytes are isolated and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line using, for example, polyethylene glycol, to form hybridoma cells that can then be selected away from unfused lymphocytes and myeloma cells. Hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies directed specifically against a chosen antigen may be identified by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and in vitro binding assay (e.g., flow cytometry, FACS, ELISA, and radioimmunoassay). The hybridomas can be propagated either in in vitro culture using standard methods (J.W. Goding, 1996, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, 3<rd> Edition, Academic Press, San Diego, CA) or in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. The monoclonal antibodies can be purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid according to standard methods in the art including, but not limited to, affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and dialysis.      In certain embodiments, monoclonal antibodies can be made using recombinant DNA techniques as known to one skilled in the art (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567). The polynucleotides encoding a monoclonal antibody are isolated from mature B-cells or hybridoma cells, such as by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers that specifically amplify the genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody, and their sequence is determined using conventional techniques. The isolated polynucleotides encoding the heavy and light chains are then cloned into suitable expression vectors which produce the monoclonal antibodies when transfected into host cells such as E. coli, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin proteins. In other embodiments, recombinant monoclonal antibodies, or fragments thereof, can be isolated from phage display libraries expressing CDRs of the desired species (see e.g., McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature, 348:552-554; Clackson et al., 1991, Nature, 352:624-628; and Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol, 222:581-597).      The polynucleotide(s) encoding a monoclonal antibody can further be modified in a number of different manners using recombinant DNA technology to generate alternative antibodies. In some embodiments, the constant domains of the light and heavy chains of, for example, a mouse monoclonal antibody can be substituted for those regions of, for example, a human antibody to generate a chimeric antibody, or for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide to generate a fusion antibody. In some embodiments, the constant regions are truncated or removed to generate the desired antibody fragment of a monoclonal antibody. Site-directed or high-density mutagenesis of the variable region can he used to optimize specificity, affinity, etc. of a monoclonal antibody.      [0169] In some embodiments, the monoclonal antibody against a human RSPO protein is a humanized antibody. Typically, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins in which residues from the CDRs are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, hamster, etc.) that have the desired specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability using methods known to one skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the Pv framework region residues of a human immunoglobulin are replaced with the corresponding residues in an antibody from a non-human species that has the desired specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability. In some embodiments, the humanized antibody can be further modified by the substitution of additional residues either in the Fv framework region and/or within the replaced non-human residues to refine and optimize antibody specificity, affinity, and/or capability. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two or three, variable domain regions containing all, or substantially all, of the CDRs that correspond to the non-human immunoglobulin whereas all, or substantially all, of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. In some embodiments, the humanized antibody can also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. In certain embodiments, such humanized antibodies are used therapeutically because they may reduce antigenicity and KAMA (human anti-mouse antibody) responses when administered to a human subject. One skilled in the art would be able to obtain a functional humanized antibody with reduced immunogenicity following known techniques (see e.g., U.S. Patent Nos, 5,225,539; 5,585,089; 5,693,761; and 5,693,762).      [0170] in certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent is a human antibody. Human antibodies can be directly prepared using various techniques known in the art. In some embodiments, immortalized human B lymphocytes immunized in vitro or isolated from an immunized individual, that produces an antibody directed against a target antigen can be generated (see, e.g., Cole et aL, 1985, Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss, p. 77; Boemer et al., 1991 , J Immunol, 147:86-95; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,750,373; 5,567,610 and 5,229,275). In some embodiments, the human antibody can be selected from a phage library, where that phage library expresses human antibodies (Vaughan et al, 1996, Nature Biotechnology, 14:309-314; Sheets et al., 1998, PNAS, 95:6157-6162; Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J Mol. Biol, 227:381; Marks et al., 1991, J Mol Biol, 222:581). Alternatively, phage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. Techniques for the generation and use of antibody phage libraries are also described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,969,108; 6,172,197; 5,885,793; 6,521,404; 6,544,731 ; 6,555,313; 6,582,915; 6,593,081 ; 6,300,064; 6,653,068; 6,706,484; and 7,264,963; and Rothe et al., 2008, J Mol Bio., 376: 1182-1200. Affinity maturation strategies including, but not limited to, chain shuffling (Marks et al., 1992, Bio/Technology, 10:779-783) and site-directed mutagenesis, are known in the art and may be employed to generate high affinity human antibodies.      [0171] In some embodiments, human antibodies can be made in transgenic mice that contain human immunoglobulin loci. These mice are capable, upon immunization, of producing the full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. This approach is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661 ,016.      [0172] This invention also encompasses bispecific antibodies that specifically recognize at least one human RSPO protein. Bispecific antibodies are capable of specifically recognizing and binding at least two different epitopes. The different epitopes can either be within the same molecule (e.g., two epitopes on human RSPOl) or on different molecules (e.g., one epitope on RSPOl and one epitope on RSP02). In some embodiments, the bispecific antibodies are monoclonal human or humanized antibodies. In some embodiments, the antibodies can specifically recognize and bind a first antigen target, (e.g., RSPOl) as well as a second antigen target, such as an effector molecule on a leukocyte (e.g., CD2, CD3, CD28, or B7) or a Fc receptor (e.g., CD64, CD32, or CD 16) so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the first antigen target. In some embodiments, the antibodies can be used to direct cytotoxic agents to cells which express a particular target antigen. These antibodies possess an antigen-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent or a radionuclide chelator, such as EOTUBE, DPTA, DOTA, or TETA. In certain embodiments, the bispecific antibody specifically binds RSPOl, as well as either an additional RSPO protein selected from the group consisting of RSP02, RSP03, and RSP04. In certain embodiments, the bispecific antibody specifically binds RSP02, as well as either an additional RSPO protein selected from the group consisting of RSPOl, RSP03, and RSP04.      [0173] Techniques for making bispecific antibodies are known by those skilled in the art, see for example, Millstein et al., 1983, Nature, 305:537-539; Brennan et al., 1985, Science, 229:81 ; Suresh et al., 1986, Methods in Enzymol., 121 :120; Traunecker et al., 1991, EMBO J., 10:3655-3659; Shalaby et al., 1992, J Exp. Med., 175:217-225; Kostelny et al., 1992, J Immunol, 148: 1547-1553; Gruber et al., 1994, J Immunol, 152:5368; U.S. Patent No. 5,731,168; and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0123532). Bispecific antibodies can be intact antibodies or antibody fragments. Antibodies with more than two valencies are also contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared (Tutt et al., 1991, J. Immunol., 147:60). Thus, in certain embodiments the antibodies to RSPOl are multispecific.      [0174] In certain embodiments, the antibodies (or other polypeptides) described herein may be monospecific. For example, in certain embodiments, each of the one or more antigen-binding sites that an antibody contains is capable of binding (or binds) a homologous epitope on RSPO proteins. In certain embodiments, an antigen-binding site of a monospecific antibody described herein is capable of binding (or binds), for example, RSPOl and RSP02 (i.e., the same epitope is found on both RSPOl and RSP02 proteins).      [0175] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent is an antibody fragment.      Antibody fragments may have different functions or capabilities than intact antibodies; for example, antibody fragments can have increased tumor penetration. Various techniques are known for the production of antibody fragments including, but not limited to, proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies. In some embodiments, antibody fragments include a F(ab')2 fragment produced by pepsin digestion of an antibody molecule. In some embodiments, antibody fragments include a Fab fragment generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of an F(ab')2 fragment. In other embodiments, antibody fragments include a Fab fragment generated by the treatment of the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent. In certain embodiments, antibody fragments are produced recombinantly. In some embodiments, antibody fragments include Fv or single chain Fv (scFv) fragments. Fab, Fv, and scFv antibody fragments can be expressed in and secreted from E. coli or other host cells, allowing for the production of large amounts of these fragments. In some embodiments, antibody fragments are isolated from antibody phage libraries as discussed herein. For example, methods can be used for the construction of Fab expression libraries (Huse et al, 1989, Science, 246:1275-1281) to allow rapid and effective identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity for a RSPO protein or derivatives, fragments, analogs or homologs thereof. In some embodiments, antibody fragments are linear antibody fragments. In certain embodiments, antibody fragments are monospecific or bispecific. In certain embodiments, the RSPO- binding agent is a scFv. Various techniques can be used for the production of single- chain antibodies specific to one or more human RSPOs (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778).      [0176] It can further be desirable, especially in the case of antibody fragments, to modify an antibody in order to increase its serum half-life. This can be achieved, for example, by incorporation of a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody fragment by mutation of the appropriate region in the antibody fragment or by incorporating the epitope into a peptide tag that is then fused to the antibody fragment at either end or in the middle (e.g., by DNA or peptide synthesis),      [0177] Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention.      Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalent!y joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980). It is also contemplated that the heteroconjugate antibodies can be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins can be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.      [0178] For the purposes of the present invention, it should be appreciated that modified antibodies can comprise any type of variable region that provides for the association of the antibody with the target (i.e., a human RSPOl or human RSP02). In this regard, the variable region may comprise or be derived from any type of mammal that can be induced to mount a humoral response and generate immunoglobulins against the desired tumor associated antigen. As such, the variable region of the modified antibodies can be*for example, of human, murine, non-human primate (e.g. cynomolgus monkeys, macaques, etc.) or rabbit origin. In some embodiments, both the variable and constant regions of the modified immunoglobulins are human. In other embodiments, the variable regions of compatible antibodies (usually derived from a non-human source) can be engineered or specifically tailored to improve the binding properties or reduce the immunogenicity of the molecule. In this respect, variable regions useful in the present invention can be humanized or otherwise altered through the inclusion of imported amino acid sequences.      [0179] In certain embodiments, the variable domains in both the heavy and light chains are altered by at least partial replacement of one or more CDRs and, if necessary, by partial framework region replacement and sequence modification and/or alteration. Although the CDRs may be derived from an antibody of the same class or even subclass as the antibody from which the framework regions are derived, it is envisaged that the CDRs will be derived from an antibody of different class and preferably from an antibody from a different species. It may not be necessary to replace all of the CDRs with all of the CDRs from the donor variable region to transfer the antigen binding capacity of one variable domain to another. Rather, it may only be necessary to transfer those residues that are necessary to maintain the activity of the antigen-binding site. Given the explanations set forth in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,585,089, 5,693,761 and 5,693,762, it will be well within the competence of those skilled in the art, either by carrying out routine experimentation or by trial and error testing to obtain a functional antibody with reduced immunogenicity.      [0180] Alterations to the variable region notwithstanding, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the modified antibodies of this invention will comprise antibodies (e.g., full-length antibodies or immunoreactive fragments thereof) in which at least a fraction of one or more of the constant region domains has been deleted or otherwise altered so as to provide desired biochemical characteristics such as increased tumor localization or increased serum half-life when compared with an antibody of approximately the same immunogenicity comprising a native or unaltered constant region. In some embodiments, the constant region of the modified antibodies will comprise a human constant region. Modifications to the constant region compatible with this invention comprise additions, deletions or substitutions of one or more amino acids in one or more domains. The modified antibodies disclosed herein may comprise alterations or modifications to one or more of the three heavy chain constant domains (CHI, CH2 or CH3) and/or to the light chain constant domain (CL). In some embodiments, one or more domains are partially or entirely deleted from the constant regions of the modified antibodies. In some embodiments, the modified antibodies will comprise domain deleted constructs or variants wherein the entire CH2 domain has been removed (ACH2 constructs). In some embodiments, the omitted constant region domain is replaced by a short amino acid spacer (e.g., 10 amino acid residues) that provides some of the molecular flexibility typically imparted by the absent constant region.      [0181] In some embodiments, the modified antibodies are engineered to fuse the CH3 domain directly to the hinge region of the antibody. In other embodiments, a peptide spacer is inserted between the hinge region and the modified CH2 and/or CH3 domains. For example, constructs may be expressed wherein the CH2 domain has been deleted and the remaining CH3 domain (modified or unmodified) is joined to the hinge region with a 5-20 amino acid spacer. Such a spacer may be added to ensure that the regulatory elements of the constant domain remain free and accessible or that the hinge region remains flexible. However, it should be noted that amino acid spacers may, in some cases, prove to be immunogenic and elicit an unwanted immune response against the construct. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, any spacer added to the construct will be relatively non-immunogenic so as to maintain the desired biological qualities of the modified antibodies.      [0182] In some embodiments, the modified antibodies may have only a partial deletion of a constant domain or substitution of a few or even a single amino acid. For example, the mutation of a single amino acid in selected areas of the CH2 domain may be enough to substantially reduce Fc binding and thereby increase cancer cell localization and/or tumor penetration. Similarly, it may be desirable to simply delete the part of one or more constant region domains that control a specific effector function (e.g. complement Clq binding) to be modulated. Such partial deletions of the constant regions may improve selected characteristics of the antibody (serum half-life) while leaving other desirable functions associated with the subject constant region domain intact. Moreover, as alluded to above, the constant regions of the disclosed antibodies may be modified through the mutation or substitution of one or more amino acids that enhances the profile of the resulting construct. In this respect it may be possible to disrupt the activity provided by a conserved binding site (e.g., Fc binding) while substantially maintaining the configuration and immunogenic profile of the modified antibody. In certain embodiments, the modified antibodies comprise the addition of one or more amino acids to the constant region to enhance desirable characteristics such as decreasing or increasing effector function or provide for more cytotoxin or carbohydrate attachment sites.      [0183] It is known in the art that the constant region mediates several effector functions.      For example, binding of the CI component of complement to the Fc region of IgG or IgM antibodies (bound to antigen) activates the complement system. Activation of complement is important in the opsonization and lysis of cell pathogens. The activation of complement also stimulates the inflammatory response and can also be involved in autoimmune hypersensitivity. In addition, the Fc region of an antibody can bind a cell expressing a Fc receptor (FcR). There are a number of Fc receptors which are specific for different classes of antibody, including IgG (gamma receptors), IgE (epsilon receptors), IgA (alpha receptors) and IgM (mu receptors). Binding of antibody to Fc receptors on cell surfaces triggers a number of important and diverse biological responses including engulfment and destruction of antibody-coated particles, clearance of immune complexes, lysis of antibody-coated target cells by killer cells (called antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or ADCC), release of inflammatory mediators, placental transfer, and control of immunoglobulin production.      [0184] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding antibodies provide for altered effector functions that, in turn, affect the biological profile of the administered antibody. For example, in some embodiments, the deletion or inactivation (through point mutations or other means) of a constant region domain may reduce Fc receptor binding of the circulating modified antibody (e.g., anti-RSPOl antibody) thereby increasing cancer cell localization and/or tumor penetration. In other embodiments, the constant region modifications increase or reduce the serum half-life of the antibody. In some embodiments, the constant region is modified to eliminate disulfide linkages or oligosaccharide moieties. Modifications to the constant region in accordance with this invention may easily be made using well known biochemical or molecular engineering techniques well within the purview of the skilled artisan. [0185] In certain embodiments, a RSPO-binding agent that is an antibody does not have one or more effector functions. For instance, in some embodiments, the antibody has no ADCC activity, and/or no complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity. In certain embodiments, the antibody does not bind an Fc receptor, and/or complement factors. In certain embodiments, the antibody has no effector function.      [0186] The present invention further embraces variants and equivalents which are substantially homologous to the chimeric, humanized, and human antibodies, or antibody fragments thereof, set forth herein. These can contain, for example, conservative substitution mutations, i.e. the substitution of one or more amino acids by similar amino acids. For example, conservative substitution refers to the substitution of an amino acid with another within the same general class such as, for example, one acidic amino acid with another acidic amino acid, one basic amino acid with another basic amino acid or one neutral amino acid by another neutral amino acid. What is intended by a conservative amino acid substitution is well known in the art and described herein.

[0194] In certain embodiments, the antibodies described herein are isolated. In certain embodiments, the antibodies described herein are substantially pure.      [0195] In some embodiments of the present invention, the RSPO-binding agents are polypeptides. The polypeptides can be recombinant polypeptides, natural polypeptides, or synthetic polypeptides comprising an antibody, or fragment thereof, that bind at least one human RSPO protein. It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequences of the invention can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the protein. Thus, the invention further includes variations of the polypeptides which show substantial activity or which include regions of an antibody, or fragment thereof, against a human RSPO protein. In some embodiments, amino acid sequence variations of RSPO-binding polypeptides include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and/or other types of substitutions.      [0196] The polypeptides, analogs and variants thereof, can be further modified to contain additional chemical moieties not normally part of the polypeptide. The derivatized moieties can improve the solubility, the biological half-life, and/or absorption of the polypeptide. The moieties can also reduce or eliminate any undesirable side effects of the polypeptides and variants. An overview for chemical moieties can be found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 2 Edition, 2005, University of the Sciences, Philadelphia, PA.      [0197] The isolated polypeptides described herein can be produced by any suitable method known in the art. Such methods range from direct protein synthesis methods to constructing a DNA sequence encoding polypeptide sequences and expressing those sequences in a suitable host. In some embodiments, a DNA sequence is constructed using recombinant technology by isolating or synthesizing a DNA sequence encoding a wild- type protein of interest. Optionally, the sequence can be mutagenized by site-specific mutagenesis to provide functional analogs thereof. See, e.g., Zoeller et al., 1984, PNAS, 81 :5662-5066 and U.S. Patent No. 4,588,585.      [0198] In some embodiments, a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest may be constructed by chemical synthesis using an oligonucleotide synthesizer. Oligonucleotides can be designed based on the amino acid sequence of the desired polypeptide and selecting those codons that are favored in the host cell in which the recombinant polypeptide of interest will be produced. Standard methods can be applied to synthesize a polynucleotide sequence encoding an isolated polypeptide of interest. For example, a complete amino acid sequence can be used to construct a back-translated gene. Further, a DNA oligomer containing a nucleotide sequence coding for the particular isolated polypeptide can be synthesized. For example, several small oligonucleotides coding for portions of the desired polypeptide can be synthesized and then ligated. The individual oligonucleotides typically contain 5' or 3' overhangs for complementary assembly.      [0199] Once assembled (by synthesis, site-directed mutagenesis, or another method), the polynucleotide sequences encoding a particular polypeptide of interest can be inserted into an expression vector and operatively linked to an expression control sequence appropriate for expression of the protein in a desired host. Proper assembly can be confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, restriction enzyme mapping, and/or expression of a biologically active polypeptide in a suitable host. As is well-known in the art, in order to obtain high expression levels of a transfected gene in a host, the gene must be operatively linked to transcriptional and translational expression control sequences that are functional in the chosen expression host. [0200] In certain embodiments, recombinant expression vectors are used to amplify and express DNA encoding antibodies, or fragments thereof, against a human RSPO protein. For example, recombinant expression vectors can be replicable DNA constructs which have synthetic or cDNA-derived DNA fragments encoding a polypeptide chain of a RSPO-binding agent, an anti-RSPO antibody, or fragment thereof, operatively linked to suitable transcriptional and/or translational regulatory elements derived from mammalian, microbial, viral or insect genes. A transcriptional unit generally comprises an assembly of (1) a genetic element or elements having a regulatory role in gene expression, for example, transcriptional promoters or enhancers, (2) a structural or coding sequence which is transcribed into mRNA and translated into protein, and (3) appropriate transcription and translation initiation and termination sequences. Regulatory elements can include an operator sequence to control transcription. The ability to replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of transformants can additionally be incorporated. DNA regions are "operatively linked" when they are functionally related to each other. For example, DNA for a signal peptide (secretory leader) is operatively linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a precursor which participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter is operatively linked to a coding sequence if it controls the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operatively linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to permit translation. In some embodiments, structural elements intended for use in yeast expression systems include a leader sequence enabling extracellular secretion of translated protein by a host cell. In other embodiments, where recombinant protein is expressed without a leader or transport sequence, it can include an N-terminal methionine residue. This residue can optionally be subsequently cleaved from the expressed recombinant protein to provide a final product.      [0201] The choice of an expression control sequence and an expression vector depends upon the choice of host. A wide variety of expression host/vector combinations can be employed. Useful expression vectors for eukaryotic hosts include, for example, vectors comprising expression control sequences from SV40, bovine papilloma virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus. Useful expression vectors for bacterial hosts include known bacterial plasmids, such as plasmids from E. coli, including pCRl, pBR322, pMB9 and their derivatives, and wider host range plasmids, such as Ml 3 and other filamentous single-stranded DNA phages.      [0202] Suitable host cells for expression of a RSPO-binding polypeptide or antibody (or a     RSPO protein to use as an antigen) include prokaryotes, yeast cells, insect cells, or higher eukaryotic cells under the control of appropriate promoters. Prokaryotes include gram- negative or gram-positive organisms, for example E. coli or Bacillus. Higher eukaryotic cells include established cell lines of mammalian origin as described below. Cell-free translation systems may also be employed. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are described by Pouwels et al. (1985, Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, Elsevier, New York, NY). Additional information regarding methods of protein production, including antibody production, can be found, e.g., in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0187954, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,413,746 and 6,660,501 , and International Patent Publication No. WO 04009823.      [0203] Various mammalian or insect cell culture systems are used to express recombinant polypeptides. Expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells can be preferred because such proteins are generally correctly folded, appropriately modified, and completely functional. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include COS-7 (monkey kidney-derived), L-929 (murine fibroblast-derived), CI 27 (murine mammary tumor-derived), 3T3 (murine fibroblast-derived), CHO (Chinese hamster ovary-derived), HeLa (human cervical cancer-derived), BHK (hamster kidney fibroblast-derived), and HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney-derived) cell lines and variants thereof. Mammalian expression vectors can comprise non-transcribed elements such as an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and enhancer linked to the gene to be expressed, and other 5 Or 3' flanking non-transcribed sequences, and 5' or 3' non-translated sequences, such as necessary ribosome binding sites, a polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, and transcriptional termination sequences. Baculovirus systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells are well-known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Luckow and Summers, 1988, Bio/Technology, 6:47).      [0204] Thus, the present invention provides cells comprising the RSPO-binding agents described herein. In some embodiments, the cells produce the RSPO-binding agents described herein. In certain embodiments, the cells produce an antibody. In certain embodiments, the cells produce antibody 89M5. In certain embodiments, the cells produce antibody h89M5-H2L2. In certain embodiments, the cells produce antibody 130M23. In certain embodiments, the cells produce antibody hl30M23-HlL2. In certain embodiments, the cells produce antibody hl30M23-HlL6. In some embodiments, the cell is a hybridoma cell line having ATCC deposit number PTA- 11970. In some embodiments, the cell is a hybridoma cell line having ATCC deposit number PTA- 12021.      [0205] The proteins produced by a transformed host can be purified according to any suitable method. Standard methods include chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for protein purification. Affinity tags such as hexa-histidine, maltose binding domain, influenza coat sequence, and glutathione-S-transferase can be attached to the protein to allow easy purification by passage over an appropriate affinity column. Isolated proteins can also be physically characterized using such techniques as proteolysis, mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and x-ray crystallography.      [0206] In some embodiments, supernatants from expression systems which secrete recombinant protein into culture media can be first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. Following the concentration step, the concentrate can be applied to a suitable purification matrix. In some embodiments, an anion exchange resin can be employed, for example, a matrix or substrate having pendant diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) groups. The matrices can be acrylamide, agarose, dextran, cellulose, or other types commonly employed in protein purification. In some embodiments, a cation exchange step can be employed. Suitable cation exchangers include various insoluble matrices comprising sulfopropyl or carboxymethyl groups. In some embodiments, a hydroxyapatite media can be employed, including but not limited to, ceramic hydroxyapatite (CHT). In certain embodiments, one or more reverse-phase HPLC steps employing hydrophobic RP-HPLC media, e.g., silica gel having pendant methyl or other aliphatic groups, can be employed to further purify a RSPO-binding agent. Some or all of the foregoing purification steps, in various combinations, can also be employed to provide a homogeneous recombinant protein.      [0207] In some embodiments, recombinant protein produced in bacterial culture can be isolated, for example, by initial extraction from cell pellets, followed by one or more concentration, salting-out, aqueous ion exchange, or size exclusion chromatography steps. HPLC can be employed for final purification steps. Microbial cells employed in expression of a recombinant protein can be disrupted by any convenient method, including freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or use of cell lysing agents.      [0208] Methods known in the art for purifying antibodies and other proteins also include, for example, those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0312425, 2008/0177048, and 2009/0187005.      [0209] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent is a polypeptide that is not an antibody. A variety of methods for identifying and producing non-antibody polypeptides that bind with high affinity to a protein target are known in the art. See, e.g., Skerra, 2007, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol, 18:295-304; Hosse et al., 2006, Protein Science, 15:14-27; Gill et al., 2006, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol, 17:653-658; Nygren, 2008, FEBS J., 275:2668- 76; and Skerra, 2008, FEBS J, 275:2677-83. In certain embodiments, phage display technology may be used to produce and/or identify a RSPO-binding polypeptide. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a protein scaffold of a type selected from the group consisting of protein A, protein G, a lipocalin, a fibronectin domain, an ankyrin consensus repeat domain, and thioredoxin.      [0210] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents or antibodies can be used in any one of a number of conjugated (i.e. an immunoconjugate or radioconjugate) or non- conjugated forms. In certain embodiments, the antibodies can be used in a non- conjugated form to harness the subject's natural defense mechanisms including complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody dependent cellular toxicity to eliminate the malignant or cancer cells.      [0211] In some embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody or polypeptide) is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent. In some embodiments, the cytotoxic agent is a chemotherapeutic agent including, but not limited to, methotrexate, adriamicin, doxorubicin, melphalan, mitomycin C, chlorambucil, daunorubicin or other intercalating agents. In some embodiments, the cytotoxic agent is an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof, including, but not limited to, diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain, ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), Momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, Sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. In some embodiments, the cytotoxic agent is a radioisotope to produce a radioconjugate or a radioconjugated antibody. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies including, but not limited to, <90>Y, <125>I, <131>I, <123>I, <l u>In, <131>In, <105>Rh, <153>Sm, <67>Cu, 6<7>Ga, <166>Ho, <177>Lu, <186>Re, <188>Re and <212>Bi. Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoids, a trichothene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity, can also be used. Conjugates of an antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyidithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis- diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1 ,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene).      III. Polynucleotides      [0212] In certain embodiments, the invention encompasses polynucleotides comprising polynucleotides that encode a polypeptide that specifically binds at least one human RSPO or a fragment of such a polypeptide. The term "polynucleotides that encode a polypeptide" encompasses a polynucleotide which includes only coding sequences for the polypeptide as well as a polynucleotide which includes additional coding and/or non- coding sequences. For example, the invention provides a polynucleotide comprising a polynucleotide sequence that encodes an antibody to a human RSPO protein or encodes a fragment of such an antibody. The polynucleotides of the invention can be in the form of RNA or in the form of DNA. DNA includes cDNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic DNA; and can be double-stranded or single-stranded, and if single stranded can be the coding strand or non-coding (anti-sense) strand.      [0213] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO:l l , SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:22, SEQ ID NO:25, SEQ ID NO:26, SEQ ID NO:53, SEQ ID NO:55, SEQ ID NO:57, SEQ ID NO:59, SEQ ID NO:68, and SEQ ID NO:69.

In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide comprising polynucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO:56. In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide comprising polynucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO:60. In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide comprising polynucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO:64. In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide comprising polynucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO:72. In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising SEQ ID NO:68 and/or SEQ ID NO:69. In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising SEQ ID NO:70 and/or SEQ ID NO:71. In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising SEQ ID NO:70 and/or SEQ ID NO:74.      [0215] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 80% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 90% identical, at least 95% identical, and in some embodiments, at least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a polynucleotide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:52, SEQ ID NO:54, SEQ ID NO:56, and SEQ ID NO:58. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 80% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 90% identical, at least 95% identical, and in some embodiments, at least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a polynucleotide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:35, SEQ ID NO:36, SEQ ID NO:39, SEQ ID NO:40, SEQ ID NO:60, SEQ ID NO:62, SEQ ID NO:64, SEQ ID NO:66, SEQ ID NO:72, and SEQ ID NO:75. Also provided is a polynucleotide that comprises a polynucleotide that hybridizes to SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:52, SEQ ID NO:54, SEQ ID NO:56, and SEQ ID NO:58, SEQ ID NO:35, SEQ ID NO:36, SEQ ID NO:39, SEQ ID NO:40, SEQ ID NO:60, SEQ ID NO:62, SEQ ID NO:64, SEQ ID NO:66, SEQ ID NO:72, or SEQ ID NO:75. In certain embodiments, the hybridization is under conditions of high stringency.      [0216] In some embodiments, an antibody is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising     SEQ ID NO:23 and SEQ ID NO:24. In some embodiments, an antibody is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising SEQ ID NO:52 and SEQ ID NO:56. In some embodiments, an antibody is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising SEQ ID NO:39 and SEQ ID NO:40. In some embodiments, an antibody is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising SEQ ID NO:60 and SEQ ID NO:64. In some embodiments, an antibody is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising SEQ ID NO:60 and SEQ ID NO:72.      [0217] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides comprise the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide fused in the same reading frame to a polynucleotide which aids, for example, in expression and secretion of a polypeptide from a host cell (e.g., a leader sequence or signal sequence which functions as a secretory sequence for controlling transport of a polypeptide from the cell). The polypeptide having a leader sequence is a preprotein and can have the leader sequence cleaved by the host cell to form the mature form of the polypeptide. The polynucleotides can also encode for a proprotein which is the mature protein plus additional 5' amino acid residues. A mature protein having a prosequence is a proprotein and is an inactive form of the protein. Once the prosequence is cleaved an active mature protein remains.      [0218] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides comprise the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide fused in the same reading frame to a marker sequence that allows, for example, for purification of the encoded polypeptide. For example, the marker sequence can be a hexa-histidine tag supplied by a pQE-9 vector to provide for purification of the mature polypeptide fused to the marker in the case of a bacterial host, or the marker sequence can be a hemagglutinin (HA) tag derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein when a mammalian host (e.g., COS-7 cells) is used. In some embodiments, the marker sequence is a FL AG-tag, a peptide of sequence DYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO: 18) which can be used in conjunction with other affinity tags.      [0219] The present invention further relates to variants of the hereinabove described polynucleotides encoding, for example, fragments, analogs, and/or derivatives.      [0220] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides polynucleotides comprising polynucleotides having a nucleotide sequence at least about 80% identical, at least about 85% identical, at least about 90% identical, at least about 95% identical, and in some embodiments, at least about 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide comprising a RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody), or fragment thereof, described herein.      [0221] As used herein, the phrase a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95% "identical" to a reference nucleotide sequence is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence can include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence. In other words, to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence can be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence can be inserted into the reference sequence. These mutations of the reference sequence can occur at the 5' or 3' terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.      [0222] The polynucleotide variants can contain alterations in the coding regions, non- coding regions, or both. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide variants contain alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide. In some embodiments, nucleotide variants are produced by silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. In some embodiments, nucleotide variants comprise nucleotide sequences which result in expression differences (e.g., increased or decreased expression), even though the amino acid sequence is not changed. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, for example, to optimize codon expression for a particular host (i.e., change codons in the human mR A to those preferred by a bacterial host such as E. coli).      [0223] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides are isolated. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides are substantially pure.      [0224] Vectors and cells comprising the polynucleotides described herein are also provided. In some embodiments, an expression vector comprises a polynucleotide molecule. In some embodiments, a host cell comprises an expression vector comprising the polynucleotide molecule. In some embodiments, a host cell comprises a polynucleotide molecule.      IV.

In certain embodiments, the tumor has elevated expression levels of RSPOl or over-expresses RSPOl . In some embodiments, the tumor has a high expression level of RSPOl . In general, the phrase "a tumor has elevated expression levels of a protein (or similar phrases) refers to expression levels of a protein in a tumor as compared to expression levels of the same protein in normal tissue of the same tissue type. However, in some embodiments, the expression levels of a protein in a tumor are "elevated" or "high" as compared to the average expression level of the protein within a group of tissue types.

Liposomes can be extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter.      [0258] In certain embodiments, sustained-release preparations can be produced. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody), where the matrices are in the form of shaped articles (e.g., films or microcapsules). Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels such as poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) or poly(vinyl alcohol), polylactides, copolymers of L-glutamic acid and 7 ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), sucrose acetate isobutyrate, and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.      [0259] In certain embodiments, in addition to administering a RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody), the method or treatment further comprises administering at least one additional therapeutic agent. An additional therapeutic agent can be administered prior to, concurrently with, and/or subsequently to, administration of the RSPO-binding agent. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a RSPO-binding agent and the additional therapeutic agent(s) are also provided. In some embodiments, the at least one additional therapeutic agent comprises 1, 2, 3, or more additional therapeutic agents.      [0260] Combination therapy with two or more therapeutic agents often uses agents that work by different mechanisms of action, although this is not required. Combination therapy using agents with different mechanisms of action may result in additive or synergetic effects. Combination therapy may allow for a lower dose of each agent than is used in monotherapy, thereby reducing toxic side effects and/or increasing the therapeutic index of the agent(s). Combination therapy may decrease the likelihood that resistant cancer cells will develop. In some embodiments, combination therapy comprises a therapeutic agent that affects (e.g., inhibits or kills) non-tumorigenic cells and a therapeutic agent that affects (e.g., inhibits or kills) tumorigenic CSCs.      [0261] In some embodiments, the combination of a RSPO-binding agent and at least one additional therapeutic agent results in additive or synergistic results. In some embodiments, the combination therapy results in an increase in the therapeutic index of the RSPO-binding agent. In some embodiments, the combination therapy results in an increase in the therapeutic index of the additional agent(s). In some embodiments, the combination therapy results in a decrease in the toxicity and/or side effects of the RSPO- binding agent. In some embodiments, the combination therapy results in a decrease in the toxicity and/or side effects of the additional agent(s).      [0262] Useful classes of therapeutic agents include, for example, antitubulin agents, auristatins, DNA minor groove binders, DNA replication inhibitors, alkylating agents (e.g., platinum complexes such as cisplatin, mono(platinum), bis(platinum) and tri-nuclear platinum complexes and carboplatin), anthracyclines, antibiotics, antifolates, antimetabolites, chemotherapy sensitizers, duocarmycins, etoposides, fluorinated pyrimidines, ionophores, lexitropsins, nitrosoureas, platinols, purine antimetabolites, puromycins, radiation sensitizers, steroids, taxanes, topoisomerase inhibitors, vinca alkaloids, or the like. In certain embodiments, the second therapeutic agent is an alkylating agent, an antimetabolite, an antimitotic, a topoisomerase inhibitor, or an angiogenesis inhibitor. In some embodiments, the second therapeutic agent is a platinum complex such as carboplatin or cisplatin. In some embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is a platinum complex in combination with a taxane.      [0263] Therapeutic agents that may be administered in combination with the RSPO- binding agents include chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, in some embodiments, the method or treatment involves the administration of a RSPOl -binding agent or antibody of the present invention in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent or cocktail of multiple different chemotherapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the method or treatment involves the administration of a RSP02-binding agent or antibody of the present invention in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent or cocktail of multiple different chemotherapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the method or treatment involves the administration of a RSP03 -binding agent or antibody of the present invention in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent or cocktail of multiple different chemotherapeutic agents.

[0273] In certain embodiments, the treatment involves the administration of a RSPO- binding agent (e.g. an antibody) of the present invention in combination with radiation therapy. Treatment with a RSPO-binding agent can occur prior to, concurrently with, or subsequent to administration of radiation therapy. Dosing schedules for such radiation therapy can be determined by the skilled medical practitioner.      [0274] Combined administration can include co-administration, either in a single pharmaceutical formulation or using separate formulations, or consecutive administration in either order but generally within a time period such that all active agents can exert their biological activities simultaneously. [0275] It will be appreciated that the combination of a RSPO-binding agent and at least one additional therapeutic agent may be administered in any order or concurrently. In some embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent will be administered to patients that have previously undergone treatment with a second therapeutic agent. In certain other embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent and a second therapeutic agent will be administered substantially simultaneously or concurrently. For example, a subject may be given a RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody) while undergoing a course of treatment with a second therapeutic agent (e.g., chemotherapy). In certain embodiments, a RSPO-binding agent will be administered within 1 year of the treatment with a second therapeutic agent.

In some embodiments, a RSPO-binding agent will be administered within 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 days of any treatment with a second therapeutic agent. It will further be appreciated that the two (or more) agents or treatments may be administered to the subject within a matter of hours or minutes (i.e., substantially simultaneously).      [0276] For the treatment of a disease, the appropriate dosage of an RSPO-binding agent     (e.g., an antibody) of the present invention depends on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the disease, the responsiveness of the disease, whether the RSPO-binding agent or antibody is administered for therapeutic or preventative purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history, and so on, all at the discretion of the treating physician. The RSPO-binding agent or antibody can be administered one time or over a series of treatments lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved (e.g., reduction in tumor size). Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient and will vary depending on the relative potency of an individual antibody or agent. The administering physician can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies, and repetition rates. In certain embodiments, dosage is from 0.0 ^g to lOOmg/kg of body weight, from O.^g to lOOmg/kg of body weight, from ^g to lOOmg/kg of body weight, from Img to lOOmg/kg of body weight, Img to 80mg/kg of body weight from lOmg to lOOmg/kg of body weight, from lOmg to 75mg/kg of body weight, or from lOmg to 50mg/kg of body weight. In certain embodiments, the dosage of the antibody or other RSPO-binding agent is from about 0.1 mg to about 20mg/kg of body weight. In certain embodiments, dosage can be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. In certain embodiments, the antibody or other RSPO-binding agent is given once every week, once every two weeks or once every three weeks.      [0277] In some embodiments, a RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody) may be administered at an initial higher "loading" dose, followed by one or more lower doses. In some embodiments, the frequency of administration may also change. In some embodiments, a dosing regimen may comprise administering an initial dose, followed by additional doses (or "maintenance" doses) once a week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, or once every month. For example, a dosing regimen may comprise administering an initial loading dose, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of, for example, one-half of the initial dose. Or a dosing regimen may comprise administering an initial loading dose, followed by maintenance doses of, for example one-half of the initial dose every other week. Or a dosing regimen may comprise administering three initial doses for 3 weeks, followed by maintenance doses of, for example, the same amount every other week.      [0278] As is known to those of skill in the art, administration of any therapeutic agent may lead to side effects and/or toxicities. In some cases, the side effects and/or toxicities are so severe as to preclude administration of the particular agent at a therapeutically effective dose. In some cases, drug therapy must be discontinued, and other agents may be tried. However, many agents in the same therapeutic class often display similar side effects and/or toxicities, meaning that the patient either has to stop therapy, or if possible, suffer from the unpleasant side effects associated with the therapeutic agent.      [0279] Thus, the present invention provides methods of treating cancer in a subject comprising using an intermittent dosing strategy for administering one or more agents, which may reduce side effects and/or toxicities associated with administration of a RSPO- binding agent, chemotherapeutic agent, etc. In some embodiments, a method for treating cancer in a human subject comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective dose of a RSPO-binding agent in combination with a therapeutically effective dose of a chemotherapeutic agent, wherein one or both of the agents are administered according to an intermittent dosing strategy. In some embodiments, the intermittent dosing strategy comprises administering an initial dose of a RSPO-binding agent to the subject, and administering subsequent doses of the RSPO-binding agent about once every 2 weeks. In some embodiments, the intermittent dosing strategy comprises administering an initial dose of a RSPO-binding agent to the subject, and administering subsequent doses of the RSPO-binding agent about once every 3 weeks. In some embodiments, the intermittent dosing strategy comprises administering an initial dose of a RSPO-binding agent to the subject, and administering subsequent doses of the RSPO-binding agent about once every 4 weeks. In some embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent is administered using an intermittent dosing strategy and the chemotherapeutic agent is administered weekly.      V.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both to materials and methods, may be practiced without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. EXAMPLES      Example 1      Expression of RSPO and LGR in human tumors      [0283] mRNA from normal tissue, benign tumor and malignant tumor samples of a large number of human patients was analyzed by microarray analysis (Genelogic BioExpress Datasuite). This data revealed elevated expression levels of RSPO 1 in malignant tissue relative to normal tissue in several tumor types including kidney, endometrial, and ovarian. RSPOl was noted to be frequently over-expressed in ovarian cancer (Fig. 1A). In addition, this data suggested elevated expression levels of RSP03 in malignant tissue relative to normal tissue in several tumor types including ovarian, pancreas, and lung (Fig. 1C). In addition, it was found that LGR5 and LGR6 were over-expressed in malignant breast tumors, colon tumors, lung tumors, and ovarian tumors relative to normal tissue, while LGR4 was over-expressed in lung tumors. LGR5 and LGR6 over- expression appeared to be restricted to triple-negative (ER<neg>PR<ne8>HER2<neg>) breast tumors relative to other breast tumor subtypes.      [0284] RNA was isolated from a series of human tumors grown in murine xenografts.      The RNA samples were prepared and processed using established Affymetrix protocols for the generation of labeled cRNA. The processed RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as outlined in the manufacturer's technical manuals. After hybridization, the microarrays were washed, scanned, and analyzed. Scanned array background adjustment and signal intensity normalization were performed using the GCRMA algorithm (Bioconductor, www.bioconductor.org).      [0285] Particular human RSPOs and human LGRs were evaluated - RSPOl (241450_at),     RSP02 (1554012_at), RSP03 (228186_s_at), RSP04 (237423_at), LGR4 (218326_s_at), LGR5 (210393_at) and LGR6 (227819_at). Microarray analysis showed that, while LGR4 and LGR6 were broadly expressed in almost all tumors, many tumors were found to greatly over-express only particular RSPO family members and LGR5 (Table 2), although these expression levels were not compared to expression levels in normal tissue. Generally there is only a single RSPO family member that is highly expressed in a given tumor, suggesting that there may be functional redundancy within the RSPO family.

RSPO-Fc constructs were generated using standard recombinant DNA techniques. Specifically, full-length human RSPOl, RSP02, RSP03 and RSP04 were ligated in-frame to a human Fc region and the recombinant RSPO-Fc proteins were expressed in insect cells using baculovirus. The fusion proteins were purified from the insect medium using protein A chromatography.      [0287] HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG-LGR5-CD4TM-GFP construct. After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of l(^g/ml RSPOl-Fc, RSP02-Fc, RSP03-FC, RSP04-Fc, or FZD8-Fc fusion proteins for 15 minutes. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by the Fc fusion proteins. Cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a positive control and with an anti-PE antibody as a negative control. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0288] As shown in Figure 2, RSPOl, RSP02, RSP03 and RSP04 all bound to LGR5 expressed on the surface of the HEK-293 cells, while FZD8, the negative control, did not bind LGR5.      [0289] Binding affinities between RSPO proteins and LGR5 were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. A soluble LGR5-Fc construct was generated using standard recombinant DNA techniques. Specifically, amino acids 1-564 of human LGR5 were ligated in frame to human Fc and the recombinant LGR5-Fc fusion protein was expressed in insect cells using baculovirus. The LGR5-Fc fusion protein was purified from the insect medium using protein A chromatography. Cleavage of the LGR5 signal sequence results in a mature LGR5-Fc fusion protein containing amino acids 22-564 of LGR5. Recombinant RSPOl-Fc, RSP02-Fc, RSP03-Fc and RSP04-Fc fusion proteins were immobilized on CM5 chips using standard amine-based chemistry (NHS/EDC), Two-fold dilutions of soluble LGR5-Fc were injected over the chip surface ( to 0.78nM). Kinetic data were collected over time using a Biacore 2000 system from Biacore Life Sciences (GE Healthcare) and the data were fit using the simultaneous global fit equation to yield affinity constants (KD values) for each RSPO protein (Table 3).      Table 3      <img class="EMIRef" id="115441282-imgf000113_0001" />    [0290] Human RSPOl, RSP02, RSP03 and RSP04 all bound to LGR5, demonstrating that RSPO proteins may be ligands for LGR proteins.      Example 3      In vitro testing for inhibition of -catenin signaling      [0291] To prepare cell suspensions, fresh human lung adenocarcinoma xenograft tumors     (lung tumor #1 in Table 2) propagated in NOD/SCID mice were minced and digested in medium 199 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 300U/ml collagenase type 3 (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) and 200U/ml DNase I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) for 1 to 2 hours at 37C. The lung tumor cells were filtered through a 40  nylon strainer (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and spun down at 82 x g for 5 minutes. Red blood cells were lysed in ACK buffer (0.8% ammonium chloride, 0.1 mM EDTA, lOmM sodium bicarbonate, 0.1N HC1), washed, and centrifuged at 150 xg for 5 minutes in medium consisting of HBSS (Mediatech, Manassas, VA), 25mM HEPES buffer (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) and 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Dead cells and debris were removed by centrifugation on a cushion of HI-FBS at 82 x g for 8 minutes. Mouse stroma cells were depleted using 501 MagnaBind streptavidin beads (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) per 10<6> cells/ml after staining with 5,ug/ml biotin-conjugated anti~H~2Kd and 2.5  anti-mouse CD45 monoclonal antibodies (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) in SM,      [0292] To produce conditioned medium, me lung tumor cells were cultured in     DME :F12 (3:1) medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with B27 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), insuiin-transferrin-selenium (Invitrogen. Carlsbad, CA), penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), ().5/1 hydrocortisone (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), 20ng/ml EOF (MBL International, Woburn, MA), 20ng/ml basic FGF (MBL International, Wobum, MA) and 5U/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After 24 hours the conditioned medium was harvested (referred to herein as "LT").      [0293] STF-293 cells are stably transfected with a 6xTCF-luciferase reporter vector. One volume of lung tumor cell-conditioned medium (LT) or control medium was added to STF-293 cells in the presence of purified soluble LGR5-Fc, FZD8-Fc, Jag-Fc fusion proteins (lC^g/ml), an anti-FZD monoclonal antibody (4(^g/ml), or antibody LZ1 (4(^g/ml). In addition, Wnt3a L-cell-conditioned medium was used as a positive control and was tested in combination with the lung tumor cell-conditioned medium (LT) at a final dilution of 1 :4. The cells were incubated for 16 hours and luciferase activity was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).      [0294] The effect of purified soluble LGR5-Fc and FZD8-Fc fusion proteins was compared to the control Jagl-Fc protein, and the effect of the anti-FZD monoclonal antibody was compared to the control anti -bacterial lysozyme antibody LZ1. As shown in Figure 3 (left side), the lung tumor cell-conditioned medium (LT) contains an activity that potentiated the Wnt3a-induced -catenin activity. The protein potentiating the - catenin activity in the LT medium was inhibited by soluble LGR5-Fc which binds to RSPO proteins. This activity was also inhibited by FZD8-Fc and the anti-FZD antibody, agents that block Wnt signaling. Soluble Jag-Fc and LZldid not inhibit the activity. Even in the absence of Wnt3a (Fig. 3, right side), the LT medium induced -catenin signaling. Soluble Jag-Fc and LZldid not inhibit this activity. In contrast, soluble LGR5-Fc inhibited the LT medium-induced -catenin signaling, reducing the response to almost control levels. This data suggested that the lung tumor cells produced a protein (or proteins) with RSPO-like activity, this activity was inhibited by LGR5, and this activity was separate from Wnt3a activity.      [0295] Similar experiments were undertaken using co-culture assays using lung tumor cell-conditioned medium and ovarian tumor cell-conditioned medium. As described above, freshly processed tumor cells depleted of stroma cells were cultured overnight. Culture medium and cells were transferred to STF-293 cells with or without Wnt3a L- cell-conditioned medium. LGR5-Fc fusion protein, a FZD8-Fc fusion protein, or a control Fc fusion protein was added (lC^g/ml). The cells were incubated for 20 hours and luciferase activity was measured as described above.      [0296] As shown in Figure 13, -catenin signaling activity was induced by the tumor cells and supernatants and further enhanced in combination with Wnt3a L-cell- conditioned medium (Fig. 13 A, lung tumor LU2; Fig. 13B, lung tumor LU25; Fig. 13C, ovarian tumor OV38). FZD8-Fc, a Wnt pathway inhibitor, reduced the Wnt3a-induced - catenin activity almost to background levels, while LGR5-Fc strongly reduced the tumor- derived -catenin activity. As above, this data suggested that the lung and ovarian tumor cells produced a protein (or proteins) with RSPO-like activity, that this activity was inhibited by LGR5, and that this activity was separate from Wnt3a activity.      Example 4      In vitro testing for inhibition of SPO activity by soluble LGR5      [0297] Conditioned medium from human lung tumor #1 cells was prepared as described in Example 3 and soluble LGR5-Fc and RSP02-Fc were produced as described in Example 2.      [0298] HEK-293 cells were transfected with a 6xTCF-luciferase reporter vector     (TOPflash, Millipore, Billerica, MA). After 24-48 hrs, the transfected cells were incubated with medium containing 25% lung tumor cell-conditioned medium plus 25% Wnt3a-L cell -conditioned medium or medium containing RSP02 (lOng/ml) plus 25% Wnt3a-L cell-conditioned medium. Soluble LGR5 was added to the cells in 4-fold serially dilutions at 2(^g/ml to O.C^g/ml. Soluble Jag-Fc protein was used as a negative control at 2C^g/ml and FZD8-Fc protein was used as a positive control at 2C^g/ml. The cells were incubated for 16 hours and luciferase activity was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).      [0299] As shown in Figure 4, increasing concentrations of soluble LGR5-Fc reduced the induction of luciferase activity by the combination of RSP02-Fc plus Wnt3a-conditioned medium (--) as well as the induction of luciferase activity by the combination of lung tumor cell-conditioned medium and Wnt3a-conditioned medium (--). Negative control Jag-Fc protein did not block the luciferase activity, while FZD8-Fc, which blocks Wnt3a, blocked the luciferase activity. Importantly, LGR5 displayed the same EC50 for inhibition with both the RSP02 protein and the lung tumor cell-conditioned medium. This data demonstrated that the protein(s) with RSPO-like activity produced by the lung tumor cells was inhibited by LGR5, behaved very similarly to a purified RSPO protein, and suggested that the activity in the lung tumor cell-conditioned media was due to a RSPO protein.      Example 5      Generation of anti-RSPOl monoclonal antibodies      [0300] Antibodies were generated against recombinant human RSPOl protein amino acids 31-263 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Mice (n=3) were immunized with RSPOl protein using standard techniques. Sera from individual mice were screened against RSPOl approximately 70 days after initial immunization using FACS analysis. The animal with the highest antibody titer was selected for final antigen boost after which spleen cells were isolated for hybridoma production. SP2/0 cells were used as fusion partners for the mouse spleen cells. Hybridoma cells were plated at 1 cell per well in 96 well plates, and the supernatants were screened against human RSPOl by FACS analysis.      [0301] For FACS screening of anti-RSPOl antibodies a chimeric fusion protein enabling cell surface expression of the N-terminal furin-like domains of human RSPOl was constructed. As shown in Figure 5 A, the fusion protein contains a N-terminal FLAG tag, followed by the two furin-like domains of RSPOl (aa 34-135) and fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of human CD4 and a C-terminal green fluorescent protein tag (FL AG-RSPO 1 furin-CD4TM-GFP) > [0302] HEK-293 cells were transfected with FLAG-RSP01furin-CD4TM-GFP. After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of 501 of hybridoma supernatants for 30 minutes. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by antibody. Cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a positive control and an anti-PE antibody as a negative control. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0303] Several hybridomas were identified that bound RSPOl, including 89M2, 89M4,     89M5, 89M7, 89M19 and 89M25 (Fig. 5B). The heavy chain and light chain variable regions were sequenced from several of these antibodies. After analysis, it was found that antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, and 89M25 comprised the same heavy and light chain variable regions. The hybridoma cell line expressing antibody 89M5 was deposited with the ATCC, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA, USA, under the conditions of the Budapest Treaty on June 30, 201 1 and assigned ATCC deposit designation number PTA- 1 1970. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of 89M5 are SEQ ID NO: 10 and SEQ ID NO:l l . The nucleotide sequences of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of 89M5 are SEQ ID NO: 19 and SEQ ID NO:20. The heavy and light chain CDRs of 89M5 are listed in Table 1 herein. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chain and light chain of 89M5 are SEQ ID NO:21 and SEQ ID NO:22; the nucleotide sequences of the heavy chain and light chain of 89M5 are SEQ ID NO:23 and SEQ ID NO:24.      Example 6      Identification of anti-RSPOl monoclonal antibodies that inhibit induction of - catenin signaling by RSPOl      [0304] HEK-293 cells were transfected with a 6xTCF-luciferase reporter vector     (TOPflash, Millipore, Billerica, MA). After 24-48 hrs, the transfected HEK-293 cells were incubated with a combination of Wnt3a (5ng/ml) and human RSPOl (l Ong/ml, R&D BioSystems) in the presence of anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, 89M7, 89M19, and 89M25, or 2 irrelevant control antibodies 254M14 and 254M26 (2-fold dilutions at 10g/ml to 0.625g/ml). The cells were incubated for 16 hours and luciferase - i n activity was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).      [0305] As shown in Figure 6, anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5 and 89M25 each blocked signaling, whereas anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M7 and 89M19 did not block signaling. As determined by sequencing of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions, antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5 and 89M25 all comprise the same heavy chain and light chain variable regions and therefore, presumably, the same antigen binding site. These results demonstrated that an anti-RSPOl antibody was able to block RSPOl - induced -catenin signaling.      Example 7      Anti-RSPOl antibodies block binding of soluble RSPOl to LGR5      [0306] HE -293 cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG-LGR5-CD4TM-GFP construct (previously described in Example 2). After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of RSPOl-Fc protein (K^g ml) and antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, 89M7, 89M19 or 89M25 (lC^g/ml). A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti -human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by the RSPOl-Fc fusion protein. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0307] As shown in Figure 7, anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5 and 89M25 each blocked binding of RSPOl to LGR5, whereas anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M7 and 89M19 did not block binding of RSPOl to LGR5. These results correlate with the results shown in Example 6 which demonstrated the ability of antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5 and 89M25 to block RSPOl signaling in an assay measuring induction of -catenin activity in a 6xTCF luciferase reporter assay, whereas antibodies 89M7 and 89M19 were not able to block RSPOl signaling. As discussed above, antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5 and 89M25 all comprise the same heavy chain and light chain variable regions and presumably the same antigen binding site, therefore it would be expected that these antibodies all function in a similar, if not identical, manner. Example 8      Binding affinities of anti-RSPOl antibodies      [0308] The KDs of antibodies 89M4, 89M5, 89M7 and 89M25 were determined using a     Biacore 2000 system from Biacore LifeSciences (GE Healthcare). Recombinant human RSPOl-Fc or mouse RSPOl-Fc proteins were immobilized on CM5 chips using standard amine-based chemistry (NHS/EDC). The antibodies were serially diluted 2-fold from  to 0.78nM in HBS-P (0.01M HEPES pH7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) and were injected over the chip surface. Kinetic data were collected over time and were fit using the simultaneous global fit equation to yield affinity constants (34 values) for each antibody.      Table 4      <img class="EMIRef" id="115441282-imgf000119_0001" />    [0309] As shown in Table 4, antibodies 89M4, 89M5, 89M7 and 89M25 all had an affinity constants (KD) for human RSPOl of less than 0.1 nM. These antibodies also had KD of less than 0.1 nM for mouse RSPOl.      Example 9      Inhibition of ovarian tumor growth in vivo by anti-RSPOl antibodies      [0310] Dissociated OV19 ovarian tumor cells (1 x 10<5>cells) were injected in the mammary fat pads of 6-8 week old NOD/SCID mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for 45 days until they reached an average volume of 134mm . The mice were randomized (n = 10 per group) and treated with anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5, 89M25, taxol, a combination of 89M5 and taxol, a combination of 89M25 and taxol, or control antibody 1B7.11. Antibodies were dosed at 15mg/kg once a week, and taxol was dosed at 7.5mg/ml once a week. Administration of the antibodies and taxol was performed via injection into the intraperitoneal cavity. Tumor growth was monitored and tumor volumes were measured with electronic calipers at the indicated time points. Data are expressed as mean  S.E.M.      [0311] At day 35, treatment with antibody 89M5 resulted in a 40% reduction in tumor growth and 89M25 resulted in a 25% reduction in tumor growth as compared to treatment with the control antibody (Fig. 8, p = 0.37 and p 0.19, respectively). Treatment with 89M5 or 89M25 in combination with taxol resulted in a reduction of tumor growth greater than treatment with either agent alone. Treatment with 89M5 and taxol resulted in a 48% reduction in growth (p = 0.12 vs. the control group), and treatment with 89M25 and taxol resulted in a 43% reduction in growth (p = 0.16 vs. the control group). Thus, antibodies 89M5 and 89M25 demonstrated anti-tumor growth activity in the OV19 ovarian tumor model as a single agent, and also displayed anti-tumor growth activity in combination with taxol.      [0312] Subsequent analysis of the tumors from the mice used in this experiment (both control and treated mice) revealed that the tumors were a mixture of human ovarian tumor cells (OV19) and murine T-cell lymphoma cells.      Example 10      Epitope mapping of anti-RSPOl monoclonal antibody 89M5      [0313] To further characterize the specific region(s) of RSPOl that antibody 89M5 binds, an epitope mapping experiment was performed. A series of constructs comprising different regions of human RSPOl were generated using standard recombinant DNA technology (see Fig. 9A). The constructs were fusion proteins each containing a N- terminal FLAG tag, followed by a portion of RSPOl protein and fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of human CD4. In some versions the fusion proteins also comprise a C-terminal green fluorescent protein tag.      [0314] HEK-293 cells were transfected with the individual constructs. After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 for 30 minutes. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by antibody. Cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a positive control and an anti-PE antibody as a negative control. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0315] As shown in Figure 9B, the FACS analysis suggests that amino acids within the furin2 domain of RSPOl are involved in the binding site for anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 (Example 10, Fig. 9). These preliminary results do not preclude that fact that amino acids in other RSPOl domains may be involved in the binding site.      Example 11      Generation of anti-RSP02 monoclonal antibodies      [0316] Antibodies were generated against recombinant human RSP02 protein amino acids 22-205 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Mice (n=3) were immunized with RSP02 protein using standard techniques. Sera from individual mice were screened against RSP02 approximately 70 days after initial immunization using FACS analysis. The animal with the highest antibody titer was selected for final antigen boost after which spleen cells were isolated for hybridoma production. SP2/0 cells were used as fusion partners for the mouse spleen cells. Hybridoma cells were plated at 1 cell per well in 96 well plates, and the supernatants were screened against human RSP02 by FACS analysis.      [0317] As described in Example 5, for FACS screening of anti-RSP02 antibodies a chimeric fusion protein enabling cell surface expression of the N-terminal furin-like domains of human RSP02 was constructed. Similar to what is depicted in Figure 5 A for RSPOl , the RSP02 fusion protein contains a N-terminal FLAG tag, followed by the furin-like domains of RSP02 (aa 31-146) and fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of human CD4 and a C-terminal green fluorescent protein tag (FL AG-RSP02furin-CD4TM-GFP) .      [0318] HEK-293 cells were transfected with FLAG-RSP02furin-CD4TM-GFP. After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of 501 of hybridoma supernatants for 30 minutes. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by antibody. Cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a positive control and an anti-PE antibody as a negative control. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0319J Several hybridomas were identified that bound RSP02, including 130M23,     130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 (Fig. 10). The heavy chain and light chain variable regions were sequenced from several of these antibodies. The hybridoma cell line expressing antibody 130M23 was deposited with the ATCC, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA, USA, under the conditions of the Budapest Treaty on August 10, 2011 and assigned ATCC deposit designation number PTA- 12021. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region of 130M23 are SEQ ID NO:27 and SEQ ID NO:28. The nucleotide sequences of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of 130M23 are SEQ ID NO:35 and SEQ ID NO:36. The heavy chain and light chain CDRs of 130M23 are listed in Table 1 herein. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chain and light chain of 130M23 are SEQ ID NO:37 and SEQ ID NO:38; the nucleotide sequences of the heavy chain and light chain of 130M23 are SEQ ID NO:39 and SEQ ID NO:40.      Example 12      Identification of anti-RSP02 monoclonal antibodies that inhibit induction of - catenin signaling by RSP02      [0320] HE -293 cells were transfected with a 6xTCF-luciferase reporter vector     (TOPflash, Millipore, Billerica, MA). After 24-48 hrs, the transfected HEK-293 cells were incubated with a combination of Wnt3a (5ng/ml) and human RSP02 (lOng/ml, R&D BioSystems) or human RSP03 (lOng/ml, R&D BioSystems) in the presence of anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28. Cells were incubated with a combination of Wnt3a and RSPO, Wnt3a only or with no addition as controls. The cells were incubated for 16 hours and luciferase activity was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).      [0321] As shown in Figure 1 1 , anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25,     130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 each reduced RSP02-induced -catenin signaling, and anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23, 130M24 completely blocked RSP02-induced -catenin signaling. In contrast these antibodies did not block -catenin signaling induced by RSP03. These results demonstrated that antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 are specific inhibitors of RSP02 and are capable of reducing and/or completely blocking RSP02-induced -catenin signaling.      Example 13      Anti-RSP02 antibodies block binding of soluble RSP02 to LGR5      [0322] HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG-LGR5-CD4TM-GFP construct (previously described in Example 2). After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of RSP02-Fc protein (l(^g/ml) and antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti- human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by the RSP02-Fc fusion protein. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0323] As shown in Figure 12, anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23 and 130M24 each blocked binding of RSP02 to LGR5, whereas anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 only weakly blocked or did not block binding of RSP02 to LGR5. These results correlate with the results shown in Example 11 which demonstrated the ability of antibodies 130M23 and 130M24 to completely block RSP02-induced -catenin signaling, whereas antibodies 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 were less potent inhibitors of RSP02-induced -catenin signaling.      Example 14      Generation of anti-RSP03 monoclonal antibodies      [0324] Antibodies are generated against recombinant human RSP03 protein amino acids     22-272 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Mice (n=3) are immunized with RSP03 protein using standard techniques. Sera from individual mice are screened against RSP03 approximately 70 days after initial immunization using FACS analysis. The animal with the highest antibody titer is selected for final antigen boost after which spleen cells are isolated for hybridoma production. SP2/0 cells are used as fusion partners for the mouse spleen cells. Hybridoma cells are plated at 1 cell per well in 96 well plates, and the supernatants are screened against human RSP03 by FACS analysis.      [0325] As described in Example 5, for FACS screening of anti-RSP03 antibodies a chimeric fusion protein enabling cell surface expression of the N-terminal furin-like domains of human RSPO was constructed. Similar to what is depicted in Figure 5A for RSPOl, the RSP03 fusion protein contains a N-terminal FLAG tag, followed by the furin-like domains of RSP03 (aa 32-141 ) and fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of human CD4 and a C-terminal green fluorescent protein tag (FLAG-RSP03furin-CD4TM-GFP).      [0326] HEK-293 cells are transfected with FLAG-RSP03furin-CD4TM-GFP. After 48 hours, transfected cells are suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of 501 of hybridoma supernatants for 30 minutes. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary antibody is performed to detect cells bound by antibody. Cells are incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a positive control and an anti-PE antibody as a negative control. The cells are analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data is processed using FlowJo software.      Example 15      Binding affinity of anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23      [0327] The KD of 130M23 was determined using a Biacore 2000 system from Biacore     LifeSciences (GE Healthcare). Recombinant human RSP02-Fc or mouse RSP02-Fc proteins were immobilized on CM5 chips using standard amine-based chemistry (NHS/EDC). The antibodies were serially diluted 2-fold from  to 0.78nM in HBS- P (0.01M HEPES pH7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) and were injected over the chip surface. Kinetic data were collected over time and were fit using the simultaneous global fit equation to yield affinity constants (KD values) for each antibody.      [0328] Antibody 130M23 had an affinity constant (KD) for human RSP02 of 0.14nM and a KD of 0.35nM for mouse RSP02. Example 16      In vitro testing for inhibition of RSPO activity by anti-RSP02 antibody      [0329] Conditioned medium from human lung tumor LU2 cells was prepared as described in Example 3 and soluble LGR5-Fc was produced as described in Example 2.      [0330] STF-293 cells were incubated with LU2 cells plus 25% lung tumor cell- conditioned medium plus 25% Wnt3a-L cell-conditioned medium. Antibody 130M23 and soluble LGR5-Fc were added to the cells in 5-fold serially dilutions from 5C^g/ml to 0.00C^g/ml. An irrelevant monoclonal antibody, similarly diluted, and a control Fc fusion protein (50ug/ml) were used as negative controls. The cells were incubated for 20 hours and luciferase activity was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).      [0331] As shown in Figure 14, increasing concentrations of soluble LGR5-Fc (--) reduced the induction of luciferase activity by the combination of lung tumor cell- conditioned medium and Wnt3a-conditioned medium. Increasing concentrations of anti- RSP02 antibody 130M23 (--) also reduced the induction of luciferase activity by the combination of lung tumor cell-conditioned medium and Wnt3a-conditioned medium. 130M23 blocked conditioned medium induced activity with an IC5o of 129nM and was greater than 100-fold more potent than LGR5-Fc. A control Fc fusion protein (--), as well as an irrelevant antibody (--) did not block the luciferase activity.      Example 17      Inhibition of pancreatic tumor growth in vivo by anti-RSPO antibodies      [0332] Dissociated PN31 pancreatic tumor cells (1 x 10<5>cells) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6-8 week old NOD/SCID mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for 61 days until they reached an average volume of 120mm . The mice were randomized (n = 10 per group) and treated with anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5, anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23, gemcitabine, a combination of 89M5 and gemcitabine, a combination of 130M23 and gemcitabine, or control antibody 1B7.11. Antibodies were dosed at 15mg/kg once a week, and gemcitabine was dosed at 30mg/ml once a week. Administration of the antibodies and gemcitabine was performed via injection into the intraperitoneal cavity. Tumor growth was monitored and tumor volumes were measured with electronic calipers at specific time points. Data are expressed as mean  S.E.M.      [0333] As shown in Figure 15, treatment with anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 or anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 as single agents had only a minimal effect on tumor growth. Treatment with gemcitabine alone reduced tumor growth by 49% as compared to the controls (p = 0.09). However, treatment with 89M5 or 130M23 in combination with gemcitabine resulted in a reduction of tumor growth greater than treatment with either agent alone. Treatment with 89M5 and gemcitabine resulted in a 59% reduction in growth (p = 0.015 vs. the control group), and treatment with 130M23 and gemcitabine resulted in a 58% reduction in growth (p = 0.016 vs. the control group). Thus, anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 and anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 demonstrated strong anti-tumor growth activity in combination with gemcitabine in a pancreatic xenograft model.      Example 18      Inhibition of pancreatic tumor growth in vivo by anti-RSPO antibodies in      combination with Wnt pathway inhibitors      [0334] Dissociated PN7 pancreatic tumor cells (1 10<5>cells) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6-8 week old NOD/SCID mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for 25 days until they reached an average volume of 130mm . The mice were randomized (n 10 per group) and treated with anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23, anti-FZD antibody 18R5, gemcitabine, a combination of 130M23 and gemcitabine, a combination of 18R5 and gemcitabine, a combination of 130M23 and 18R5, a combination of 130M23, 18R5 and gemcitabine, or control antibody 1B7.1 1. Anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 was dosed at lOmg/kg once a week, anti-FZD antibody 18R5 was dosed at 20mg/kg once a week, and gemcitabine was dosed at 30mg/ml once a week. Administration of the antibodies and gemcitabine was performed via injection into the intraperitoneal cavity. Tumor growth was monitored and tumor volumes were measured with electronic calipers at specific time points. Data are expressed as mean  S.E.M. A parallel set of experiments included mice treated with a FZD8-Fc soluble receptor (lOmg/kg) in combination with gemcitabine and FZD8-Fc in combination with 130M23 and gemcitabine. [0335] Treatment with antibody 130M23 or antibody 18R5 as a single agent resulted in approximately 55% reduction in tumor growth as compared to treatment with the control antibody (Fig. 16A, p < 0.001). Treatment with 130M23 or 18R5 in combination with gemcitabine resulted in a reduction of tumor growth greater than treatment with either agent alone. Treatment with 130M23 and gemcitabine resulted in a 68% reduction in growth (p < 0.001 vs. the control group), and treatment with 18R5 and gemcitabine resulted in a 75% reduction in growth (p < 0.001 vs. the control group). Furthermore, a combination of 130M23, gemcitabine and 18R5 resulted in almost complete inhibition of growth of the PN7 tumors (Fig. 16 A). Similar results were seen with a combination of 130M23, gemcitabine and a FZD8-Fc soluble receptor (Fig. 16B). Thus, an anti-RSP02 antibody such as 130M23 has single agent activity in inhibiting pancreatic tumor growth. Furthermore, combination of an anti-RSP02 antibody with gemcitabine, or a combination of an anti-RSP02 antibody with gemcitabine and a Wnt pathway inhibitor such as anti- FZD antibody 18R5 or a FZD8-Fc soluble receptor, was shown to be a very effective therapy for inhibiting tumor growth in a pancreatic tumor model.      [0336] IHC studies showed that the anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 induced morphological changes in the PN7 tumors of treated mice as compared to untreated mice. These cells also displayed a significant decrease in proliferation using an anti-Ki67 antibody. These results possibly reflect a loss in tumor cells and an increase in stroma.      [0337] The PN7 tumors described above were processed to yield single cell suspensions.      Mouse cells were depleted from the cell mixtures using biotinylated anti-H2K<d> and anti- CD45 antibodies and streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. The remaining human tumor cells were serially transplanted into a new cohort of mice. 90 tumor cells from each treatment group were injected into the flanks of NOD-SCID mice (n = 10 mice per group). Tumors were allowed to grow for 40 days with no treatment and tumor volumes were measured with electronic calipers.      [0338] Figure 16C shows the tumor volume from individual mice in each group. Cells isolated from mice treated with anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 or anti-FZD antibody 18R5 as single agents or in a combination had greatly decreased tumorigenicity as compared to cells isolated from mice treated with control antibody. This reduced tumorigenicity was much greater than the decrease in tumorigenicity observed with gemcitabine alone. Cells from mice treated with combinations of gemcitabine and 130M23, gemcitabine and 18R5, or gemcitabine and FZD8-Fc showed tumorigenicity that was only slightly reduced as compared to cell isolated from mice treated with control antibody. Interestingly, cells isolated from mice treated with a combination of 130M23, 18R5 and gemcitabine or 130M23, FZD8-Fc and gemcitabine demonstrated a significant and striking lack of tumor growth, greater than any of the agents alone or in two agent combinations. These results showed that inhibiting multiple pathways in addition to standard chemotherapy has an additive, and possibly a synergistic effect in reducing tumorigenicity and cancer stem cells.      Example 19      Humanization of RSPO antibodies Humanized antibodies against human RSPOl and RSP02 were generated. The heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region of the murine monoclonal antibodies 89M5 and 130M23 were isolated and sequenced from the hybridoma line using degenerate PCR essentially as described in Larrick, J.M., et al., 1989, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 160: 1250 and Jones, S.T. & Bendig, M.M., 1991, Bio/Technology 9: 88. Human heavy and light chain variable framework regions likely to be structurally similar to the parental 89M5 or 130M23 antibody amino acid sequences were then considered as reference human framework regions to help guide the design of novel synthetic frameworks. To identify the human framework regions bearing similarity to murine frameworks, the predicted protein sequences encoded by the murine heavy chain and light chain variable domains of 89M5 and 130M23 were compared with human antibody sequences encoded by expressed human cDNA using BLAST searches for human sequence deposited in Genbank. The amino acid differences between candidate humanized framework heavy chains and the parent murine monoclonal antibody heavy chain variable regions and light chain variable regions were evaluated for likely importance, and a judgment made as to whether each difference in position contributes to proper folding and function of the variable region. This analysis was guided by examination of solved crystal structures of other antibody fragments (e.g., the structure of Fab 2E8 as described in Trakhanov et al, Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr, 1999, 55: 122-28, as well as other protein crystal structures (e.g., protein data bank structures 1ADQ and 1GIG)). Structures were modeled using computer software including Jmol, quick PDB, and Pymol. Consideration was given to the potential impact of an amino acid at a given position on the packing of the -sheet framework, the interaction between the heavy and light chain variable regions, the degree of solvent exposure of the amino acid side chain, and the likelihood that an amino acid would impact the positioning of the CDR loops. From this analysis, candidate heavy chain variable regions fused in-frame to the human IgG2 constant region and candidate light chain variable regions fused in frame with the human Ig Cl constant region were conceived and chemically synthesized. The candidate heavy chains and light chains comprise: i) a synthetic framework designed to resemble natural human frameworks and ii) the parental 89M5 or 130M23 murine antibody CDRs.      [0340] The functionality of each candidate variant humanized heavy chain and light chain was tested by cotransfection into mammalian cells. Each candidate humanized heavy chain described above was cotransfected into HEK-293 cells with the murine light chain cDNA, and conditioned media was assayed by FACS for RSPO binding activity. Humanized 89M5 heavy chain variant "89M5-H2" (SEQ ID NO:68) exhibited the most robust binding and was selected. The 89M5-H2 humanized heavy chain was cotransfected into HEK-293 cells with each of the candidate humanized light chains, and conditioned media was again assayed for antigen binding by FACS. Light chain variant "89M5-L2" (SEQ ID NO:69) exhibited the most robust binding and was selected. Similarly the humanized 130M23 heavy chain variant "130M23-H1" (SEQ ID NO:70) exhibited the most robust binding and was selected. The 130M23-H1 humanized heavy chain was cotransfected into HEK-293 cells with each of the candidate humanized light chains, and conditioned media was again assayed for antigen binding by FACS. Light chain variant "130M23-L2" (SEQ ID NO:71) exhibited the most robust binding and was selected.      [0341] To increase antibody production, a variant of 130M23-H1L2 was generated. The variant comprises the same heavy chain as 130M23-H1 L2, but has a modified light chain and is referred to as hl30M23-HlL6. Example 20      Binding affinity of humanized 89M5 and humanized 130M23      [0342] The KD of h89M5-H2L2 was determined using a Biacore 2000 system from     Biacore LifeSciences (GE Healthcare). Recombinant human RSPOl-Fc or mouse RSPOl-Fc proteins were immobilized on CM5 chips using standard amine-based chemistry (NHS/EDC). The antibodies were serially diluted 2-fold from lOOnM to 0.78nM in HBS-P (0.01M HEPES pH7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) and were injected over the chip surface. Kinetic data were collected over time and were fit using the simultaneous global fit equation to yield affinity constants (KD values) for each antibody.      [0343] h89M5-H2L2 had an affinity constant (KD) for human RSPOl and mouse RSPOl of less than 0.1 nM.      [0344] The KD of hl30M23-HlL2 and hl30M23-H!L6 were determined using a Biacore     2000 system from Biacore LifeSciences (GE Healthcare). Recombinant human RSP02- Fc protein was immobilized on CM5 chips using standard amine-based chemistry (NHS/EDC). The antibodies were serially diluted 2-fold from lOOnM to 0.78nM in HBS- P (0.01M HEPES pH7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) and were injected over the chip surface. Kinetic data were collected over time and were fit using the simultaneous global fit equation to yield affinity constants (KD values) for each antibody.      [0345] hl30M23-HlL2 had an affinity constant (KD) for human RSP02 of 0.13nM and hl30M23-HlL6 had an affinity constant (KD) for human RSP02 of 0.15nM.      Example 21      FACS binding of anti-RSPO antibodies      [0346] HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding     FLAG-RSP01furin-CD4TM-GFP. As described in Example 5, FLAG-RSPO 1 furin- CD4TM-GFP is a chimeric fusion protein enabling cell surface expression of the N- terminal furin-like domains of human RSPOl . FLAG-RSPO lfurin-CD4TM-GFP transfected cells were incubated in the presence of anti-RSPO 1 antibody 89M5 or humanized anti-RSPO 1 antibody h89M5-H2L2. Five-fold serial dilutions of each antibody were examined for their ability to bind to the RSPOl expressing cells. The cells were stained with Phycoerythrin conjugated anti-IgG to reveal bound antibody. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0347] As shown in Figure 17A, these studies indicate that both anti-RSPOl antibody     89M5 and humanized anti-RSPOl antibody h89M5-H2L2 bind to human RSPOl .      [0348] HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding     FLAG-RSP02furin-CD4TM-GFP. As described in Example 11, FLAG-RSP02furin- CD4TM-GFP is a chimeric fusion protein enabling cell surface expression of the N- terminal furin-like domains of human RSP02. FLAG-RSP02furin-CD4TM-GFP transfected cells were incubated in the presence of anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 or humanized anti-RSP02 antibody hl30M5-HlL2. Five-fold serial dilutions of each antibody were examined for their ability to bind to the RSP02 expressing cells. The cells were stained with Phycoerythrin conjugated anti-IgG to reveal bound antibody. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0349] As shown in Figure 17B, these studies indicate that both anti-RSP02 antibody     130M23 and humanized anti-RSP02 antibody hl 30M23-HlL2 bind to human RSP02.      Example 22      Inhibition of breast tumor growth in vivo by anti-RSPO antibodies in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent      [0350] Dissociated OMP-B39 breast tumor cells (4 x 10<5>cells) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6-8 week old NOD/SCID mice. OMP-039 is a triple negative breast cancer tumor with a high level of RSP02 expression. In addition, the level of RSPOl is higher than other breast tumors characterized in Example 1 (see Table 2). Tumors were allowed to grow for 39 days until they reached an average volume of 120mni3. The mice were randomized (n = 10 per group) and treated with a combination of anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 and anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23, cisplatin, a combination of anti-RSPOl and RSP02 antibodies and cisplatin, or a control antibody. Antibodies were dosed at 15mg/kg once a week and cisplatin was dosed at 1.5mg/kg twice a week. Administration of the antibodies and cisplatin was performed via injection into the intraperitoneal cavity. Tumor growth was monitored and tumor volumes were measured with electronic calipers on the indicated days. Data are expressed as mean  S.E.M.      [0351] As shown in Figure 18, a combination of anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 and anti-     RSP02 antibody 130M23 with cisplatin inhibited tumor growth better than cisplatin alone (p = 0.04, combination group vs cisplatin alone). The triple combination had a significant effect, despite the fact that the combination of antibodies 89M5 and 130M25 without cisplatin had only a minimal effect on this tumor.
