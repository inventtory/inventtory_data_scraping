The invention further provides resin formulations useful in the production of the prepregs.      Composite materials have well-documented advantages over traditional construction materials, particularly in providing excellent mechanical properties at very low material densities. As a result, the use of such materials is becoming increasingly widespread and their fields of application range from ""industrial"" to high performance aerospace components including aircraft fuselages.      Prepregs. comprising a fibre arrangement impregnated with resin such as epoxy resin, are widely used in the generation of such composite materials. Typically a number of plies of such prepregs are ""laid-up"" as desired and the resulting laminate is cured, typically by exposure to elevated temperatures, to produce a cured composite laminate. The term prepreg is used to describe fibres and fabric impregnated with a resin in the unciired or partially cured state and ready for curing. The fibres may be in the form of tows or fabrics and a tow generally comprises a plurality of thin fibres, the fibrous materials may be of carbon fibre, glass or aramid, this invention is particularly concerned with carbon fibre. The chemical composition of the resins employed in the prepregs will depend upon the piOperties required of the cured fibre reinforced material and also the use to which the cured material is to be put. Prepregs are typically prepared by the deposition of a liquid resin composition onto a moving layer of fibrous material and compressing the liquid resin into the fibrous material whilst, at the same time, forming a layer of the resin on the surface of the fibrous material The resin composition may be applied to one or both sides of the layer of fibrous material. The term ""interlayer ' is used herein to describe a resin layer between two fibrous layers. Composite materials is the term used to describe cured prepregs i.e. where the resm has been cured and composites are often made up from a laminate of a plurality of prepreg layers laid up on top of one another. This results in a laminate structure of fibre   arrangements separated by resin inteiieafs or resin inter layers. The interlayers typically comprise cured epoxy resins which are poor conductors of electricity. Although the fibres particularly carbon fibres have some electrical conductivity, the presence of the interleaf iiiterlayers means that conductivity is exhibited only in the plane of the laminate. The electrical conductivity in the direction orthogonal to the surface of the laminate, the so- called ""Z"" direction, is low.      This lack -of conductivity in the ""Z"" direc tion contiibutes to the wlnerabili y of composite laminates to electromagnetic hazards -such as lightning strikes. A lightning strike can cause damage to the composite material which can be quite extensive, and could be catastrophic if occurring on an aircraft structure in flight This is <'>therefore a particular problem for aerospace <'>structures, particularly aircraft structures made from such composite materials.      Additionally composites for use in aerospace applications must meet exacting standards on mechanical properties. Thus, any improvements in conductivity must not impact negatively on the required mechanical properties.      A wide range of techniques and methods have been suggested to provide lightning strike protection to such composite materials. There have been many suggestions involving the addition of conductive elements at the expense of increasing the weight of the composite material.      There have been man}? proposals to use electrically conducting particles including carbon particles to increase the electrical conductivity of fibre reinforced composites. For example, WO2011/027160; WO2011/114140 and WO2010/150022 are all concerned with increasing the eieciiical conductivity of carbon fibre reinforced composites such as carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resins. They are in particular concerned with increasing the electrical conductivity in the ""Z"" direction and disclose that conductive particles such as carbon particles may be included in the thermosetting resin to increase the conductivity. Yet further it is suggested that the resin may include particles of thermoplastic materials that are insoluble in the thermosetting resin such as polyamides in order to improve the impact resistance of the composite comprising the cured prepreg. These references also   include a thermoplastic resin thai is soluble in the thermosetting resin to improve the flow of the resin during processing. Examples of soluble mennoplastic resins that may be used include polyethersnlphones and polyamideimid.es. It has been suggested that conductive particles may be included in an interleaf resin layer as is described in Russian Patent 22635SI which uses hard lerite carbon particles in the interleaf layer to provide lightning protection of exposed aircraft parts. WO 2008/056123 and WO2011/027160 also provide conductive particles in the interleaf layers to improve the ""Z"" direction conductivity. WO2008/05 123 employs metallic particles and WO2011/027160 employs hard glassy carbon particles at a level of from 0.3 to 2.0 vvt % based on the total resin in the prepreg.      United States Patent 7931958 B2 employs both conductive particles and thermoplastic resin particles in an interleaf layer in a prepreg based composite. The conductive particles are used to increase the ""Z"" direction conductivity and the thermoplastic resin particles perform the well known function of toughening the cured composite. These known conductive particles are costly and highly specialised materials. They ma be particles or fibres having a thermoplastic nucleus coated with a conductive substance or a conductive particle such as a carbon particle such as Bellpearl C-600, C-800, C-2000 deiived from phenolic resins or Nicabeads ICS. PC and MC (produced by Nippon Carbon Co Ltd) which are hard carbon particles produced by carbonising and adding a resin surface coating . Also commonly metal or metal-coated conductive particles have been used for this purpose. However, introducing metal into prepregs has been found to be undesirable due to the possibility of corrosion effects, explosion hazards and differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion of the materials.      According to United States Patent 7931958 B2 the total amount of the thermoplastic material and the conductive particles should be 20 wt % or less with respect to the prepreg and the ratio of the weight of mennoplastic particle to the conductive particle is from 1 to 1000. The particles are preferably of a size at most 150  preferably from 5 to 30 . Where the Examples use carbon particles 0.4 parts of Bellpearl C-2000 are used together   with 1 .6 parts of an epoxy modified nylon particle in 100 parts of the thermosetting epoxy resin system, a ratio of 49.0 to provide a <'>""Z"" direction volume resistivity of 28 x 10<3>  cm.      An alternative method for increasing tiie conductivity of composites based on cared prepregs in the <**>Z"" direction is described in PCT publications WO201.0/150022 and WO2011/114140 in. which <'>the surface of the carbon fibres is disrupted during the prepreg manufacturing process. For example, prior to impregnation with the resin, the fibre tow may be passed over rollers with an abrasive surface. This forms protuberances or broken fibrils at the surface of the fibre tows which will extend into the interleaf iterlayer when the resin is applied to the fibres and may contact protuberances formed on the next fibrous layer. This provides to provide an electrically conductive pathway across the interlayer and hence improves electrical conductivity<7> in the ""Z"" direction.      There remains a need to further increase the electrical conductivity in the ""Z"" direction of composites derived from prepregs whilst retaining or enhancing the mechanical properties of the composite. According to the invention, there is provided a prepreg, a moulding material, a composite, a use and a resin composition useful in the production of the prepregs as defined in any of the accompanying claims. We have found that potato shaped graphite (PSG) is particularly useful for increasing the electiical conductivity of fibre reinforced composite, particularly carbon fibre reinforced composite.      The term ""potato graphite"" will be used herein to describe graphite processed to increase the porosity or spherocity of the graphite. The process may be practiced on natural (e.g.. vein graphite) or artificial graphite (e.g., highly crystalline synthetic graphite). Prior to processing, the graphite is commonly scaly (e.g., plate like) or flake graphite having a relatively high degree of crystaUinity. The graphite is processed by nulling, rolling, grinding, compressing, defonmng, etc. the graphite to bend, fold, shape, form, etc. the flakes into a roughly spherical shape. This process may increase the isotropic properties of the graphite over the more anisotropic flake form of the graphite. The potato shaped graphite particles may be coated or uncoated. They may be coated by vapour deposition   which typically deposits a highly conductive layer of carbon. The PSG particle can exhibit a planar crystalline structure, whereas the CVD carbon layer is deposited on top of this as an amorphous carbon coating. The Carbon coating can lower the specific resistivity of the PSG. The PSG particles may also be coated by other coating processes known to the art, for example metallisation or sputtering. They may be coated by carbon in any of its forms, or with metals or polymers. The term potato shaped graphite' is common to the art as can be seen in the following examples: High-Purity Graphite      Powders for High Performance, by Giovanni Juri, Henri-Albert Wilhelm and Jean      L'Heureux, Timed Ltd. Switzerland, 2007 and Graphite: High-tech Supply Sharpens Up, Penny Crossley, industrial Minerals, 2000.      The term ""potato shaped graphite"" is also used herein to describe graphite having a shape that is typically produced by the process described above (whether produced by such process, by another process or processes, naturally occurring, etc.). ""Potato shaped graphite"" commonly ranges in shape from the shape of a potato to almost spherical . ""Potato shaped graphite"" is typically elongated, oblong, etc. and may include graphite having an ellipsoid shape, an ovoid shape, a rectangular shape, an oblate spheroid shape, etc. Both ""potato graphite"" overall and individual particles of ""potato graphite"" do not necessarily have a uniform shape and do not necessarily have a symmetrical shape. As used herein, the term ""potato shaped graphite"" is intended to encompass graphite produced by the process described above, and graphite having the shapes as explained in this paragraph.      Typically PSG have at least one of the following two characteristics: a tap density between 0.3 and 1.5, preferably between 0.5 and 1.4, most preferably between 1 and 1.3 g/ec, when measured according to the method associated with the instrument sold under the name of Logan Instrument Corp. Model Tap-2. They also have a granulometric dispersion measured according to the method associated with the particle analyser sold under the name Microtac Model I 00 Particle Analyzer, such that the D90/D10 distribution ratio varies between 2 and 5, and the particles have a size between 1 urn and 50 , preferably such that the D90 D10 distribution ratio varies between 2.2 and 4.2 and the particles have a size between 2 um and 30  and or combinations of the aforesaid ranges.   We have found that coated PSG particles as supplied Nippon Power Graphite Company of Japan, haying an average particle size of 10 to 20 microns, preferably of 15 microns are particularly suitable for increasing the electrical conductivity of the prepreg. Coated PSG typically has a harde surface <'>than uacoated PSG and a. lower specific resistivity, the resistivity can be at least 50% lower than the uiicoated PSG. In addition PSG particles from KGS Naturgraphii of Germany are suitable for use in this invention. Other suppliers of spheroidal or near spherical graphite with the properties similar to those described above are also suitable for use in this invention. The present invention therefore provides a prepreg comprising a fibre reinforced curable resin the prepreg containing potato shaped graphite.      In a further embodiment the invention provides a composite comprising a fibre reinforced resin the composite containing potato shaped graphite. in a further embodiment the invention provides a resin composition useful in the production of such a prepreg or composite comprising a curable resin containing potato shaped graphite. The invention is particularly useful in compositions comprising resin impregnated fibrous layers separated by an interlayer. Accordingly, the invention therefore provides a composite material comprising at least two layers of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin and an interleaf resin layer there between, said interleaf resin layer or interlayer comprising an electrically conductive particle. The electrically conductive particle may comprise potato shaped giapliite. Preferably the composite material contains from 0.5 to 10 weight % preferably from 1 to 8 weight %, more preferably 0.5 to 5 weight %, especially 1.5 to 5 weight % and most preferably from 2 to 4 weight % in relation to the resin of said electrically conductive particle. Conventionally, in a composite material a resin matrix reinforces the fibrous material by virtue of its presence around the fibrous material or fibrous reinforcement, in the context of this invention, as a result of the structure of the composite material independent layers   of resin in which the fibrous reinforcement is present can be distinguished as fibre reinforced resin layer's, and these layers by virtue of their laminate structure form an mterlayer or interleave there between. In another embodiment of the invention, the pr esence of the electrically conductive particle is optional. In this embodiment,- t least one layer of the carbon fibre reinforcement has a weight in the range of from 10 to 200 g/m<2>, preferably of from 15 to 150 g/m<2>. Advantageously, the carbon fibre reinforcement may be in the form of a spread fabric or flat fibre tow fabric such as the fabric as disclosed in WO 98/46817, the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.      In a preferred embodiment the resin or resin composition and/or the interlayer additionally contain a toughener which is typically a thermoplastic material. The thermoplastic material may be in the form of a particle. The thermoplastic particle may be present in the range of from 5 to 20 weight % in relation to the resin, preferably from 9 to 15 weight % in relation to the resin, arid more preferably from 9 to 14 weight % in relation to the resin. In a yet further preferred embodiment the thermoplastic material is a polyamide. Suitable examples of thermoplastic particles include, by way of example, poly amides, polycarbonates, polyacetal, polyphenylene oxide, poiyphenylene sulphide, polya.cryla.tes, poly ethers, polyesters, polyimides. polyamidoimides, polyether imides, polyurethanes. Polyamides are the preferred type of thermoplastic particles. The polyamide particles may be made from polyamide 6 (caprolactam - PA6). polyamide 12 (laurolactam - PA12), polyamide 11 , polvurethane, polymeihyl metha.cryla.te, crosslinked polymethyl methaciylate, densified polyethylene sulfone. or any combination thereof. Preferred thermoplastic particles are polyamide particles that have a melting point of between about 140C and 240C. The particles should have particle sizes of below 100 microns, it is preferred that the particles range in size from 5 to 60 microns and more preferably from 10 to 30 microns. It is preferred that the average particle size be around 20 microns. Suitable polyamide particles that may be used are: Orgasol 1002 D NAT! (PA6), Rilsan PA11 P C20HT (PA11), Ultramid 4350 (PA6T).   Hie resin or resin formulations used in the present invention preferably comprise curable epoxy resins, curing agents and curing agent accelerators. Cure accelerators may be usually .heat activated and are usually included in the resin to shorten the cure cycle time. Typically the fommlatioiis are cured by heating to a certain temperature for a certain time. The .formulations are developed to possess the desired cure temperature and cure time for the intended application. The reactivity of the formulation is measured as the time required to accomplish a certain degree of cure when held at a certain temperature. The resin system may also contain a thermoplastic material which is soluble in the epoxy resin such as polyethersu!fone to improve the toughness of the resin. in the production of finished articles including composites the prepregs may be cured and laminated together such as in a stack or they may be laminated to other materials. Typically curing takes place by heating the prepregs in a mould, an autoclave, a press or in a vacuum bag to cure the epoxy resin. The cure cycles employed for curing prepregs and stacks of prepregs are a balance of temperature and time, taking into account the reactivity of the resin and the amount of resin and fibre employed. From an economic point of view, in many applications it is desirable that the cycle time is as short as possible, curing agents and accelerators are usually selected to achieve this. As well as requiring heat to initiate curing of the resin, the curing reaction itself can be highly exothermic. This needs to be taken into account in the time/temperahire curing cycle in particular for the curing of large and thick stacks of prepregs, as is increasingly the case with the production of laminates for industrial application where high temperatures can be generated within the stack due to the exoiherm of the resin curing reaction. Excessive temperatures are to be avoided as they can damage the mould or cause some decomposition of the resin. Excessive temperatures can also cause loss of control over the cure of the resin leading to run away ern e. in addition to these problems, there is a desire to produce laminar structures from prepregs in which the cured resin has a high glass transition temperature (Tg), to extend the usefulness of the structures by improving their resistance to exposure at high temperatures, and/or high hiuiiidity for extended periods of time which can cause an undesirable lowering   of the Tg. Preferably, the Tg is from 150C to 200 C, more preferably from I60C to 200     C.      Potato shaped graphite (PSG) particles are described in United States Patent Publication 2010/0092808, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, and have at least one of the following characteristics: a tab density between 0.3 and 1.5 g cc, a potato like shape, and a graniilometric dispersion such that the D90 D10 ratio varies between 2 and 5. and the particles have a size between 1 and 50  as measured using a Microtac Model XI 00 particle analyser. In an embodiment in which disrupted fibres are also in the resin interlayer, the size and shape of the carbon particles is less important as both the fibres and the particles contribute to the increase in conductivity.      Additionally; we have found that by use of the disrupted fibres, smaller amounts of conductive particles are required to achieve a given electr ical conductivity. Potato shaped graphite is a relatively soft material which allows the material to partly disintegrate during resin impregnation and additionally, due to their shape and softness the use of potato shaped graphite particles reduces the tendency of the resin composition to damage the surface of the rollers that are employed in the manufacturing of prepregs. PSG particles that are in a spherical or near spherical shape are preferred as this enables the conductivity to be increased for a minimal concentration of PSG in relation to the resin. It is preferred that the prepreg contain from 0.05 to 4.5 wt % potato shaped graphite, more preferably to 0.1 to 3.0 wt %, and most preferably between 0.25 wt % and 1.5 wt %      One suitable potato shaped graphite (PSG) is the product supplied by NGS Naturgraphit of Germany, called SG25/99.95 SC which has an average particle size of from 10 to 30 microns. Alternatively, PSG supplied by Nippon Power Graphite Company of Japan, called GHDR-15-4 and having an average particle size of from 10 to 30 microns may preferably be used. The GHDR-15-4 comprises a carbon coating deposited by carbon vapour deposition on to its outer surface. Spherical or spheroidal graphite available from other suppliers such as Timrex are also suitable.   In one embodiment the composite of the invention may be formed by curing <'>two or more separate layer's of fibrous reinforcement, impregnated with resin with an interleaf layer of resin containing the potato shaped graphite particles therebetween. The layers preferably comprise omdirectional tows, die tows of each layer being substantially parallel. Tlie two layers may be conjoined by compression so that the unidirectional tows are in the same plane. One or more additional <'>fibrous layers may also be combined with the conjoined layers.      The prepregs of the present invention may be prepared by the process described and illustrated in WO2010/150022, the contents of which, is hereby incorporated by reference. This process comprises feeding a layer of unidirectional conductive fibres having a defined width, bringing into contact with a first face of the fibres a first layer of resin comprising thermosetting resin containing potato shaped graphite and compressing the resin and fibres together by passing over one or more impregnation rollers. The pressure exerted onto the conductive fibres and resin preferably does not exceed 40 kg per centimetre of tlie width of tlie conductive fibres. The resin is preferably provided i sufficient amount for the resin to enter tlie interstices of the fibres and leave a first outer layer of resin essentially free of unidirectioiial conductive fibres. This outer layer becomes tire interlayer. In particular continuously feeding tows of unidirectional conductive fibres, bringing into contact with a face of the fibres a first layer of resin comprising thermosetting resin, and compressing the resin and fibres together through at least one S-wrap stage whilst providing sufficient resin to both enter the interstices of the fibres and leaving a first outer layer of resin.      Prepregs produced by this process can be manipulated to have a disrupted fibre layer, such that when a plurality of such prepregs are stacked together, producing a prepreg stack comprising a plurality of structural layers separated by resin-containing disrupted conductive fibres interleaf layers and containing electrically conductive particles. The prepreg stack is then cm ed to form a cured composite lammate, much greater conductivity in the ""Z"" direction is obtained whilst retaining excellent toughness properties.      Alternatively the interleaf prepregs may be produced in a two stage process. The first stage disrupts the surface of the fibre to produce disrupted fibres and brings the fibre into contact   with resin which enters the interstices, followed by bringing into contact with another resin comprising conductive particles and optionally toiighener particles. This second stage is intended merely to lay down the resin including the particulate materials and in so doing produce a uniform thickness layer of resin free of conductive fibres which becomes an interleaf layer when a plurality of such prepregs are stacked together.      The preferred process to manufacture prepregs of this invention is therefore a continuous process involving the passage of many thousands of fibres through a series of stages, typically guided by rollers. The point where the fibres meet the resin or resin composition of the invention, usually in sheet form, is the start of the impregnation stage. Before the fibres are contacted with the resin and reach the impregnation zone they are typically arranged in a plurality of tows, each tow comprising many thousands of filaments, e.g. 12,000. These tows are mounted on bobbins and are fed initially to a combing unit to ensure even separation of t e fibres. It has been found that unusually low fibre tensions just after the bobbin feed position provide further improvement to the disruption of the fibres in the eventual prepreg. Thus, the tension per filament at this position is preferably from 0.0007 to 0.025 g, preferably from 0.01 to 0.015 g. if disruptive or disrupted fibres are required the fibres may also be passed over roughened surfaces such as abrasive rollers to produce the disruptive or disrupted fibres which become part of the interleaf layer. The fibre processing speed and tension may be controlled to give the desired degr ee of disruption. in the process, a second layer of resin comprising thermosetting resin may be brought into contact with the other face of the fibres typically at the same time as the first layer, compressing the first and second layers of resin such that resin enters the interstices of the fibres. Such a process is considered to be a one-stage process because, although each face of the fibres is contacted with one resin layer, all the resin in the eventual prepreg is impregnated in one stage.   Resin impregnation typically involves passing the resin and fibres over rollers, which, may be arranged .in a variety of ways. Two primary arrangements are the simple ""nip"" arrangement and the ""S-wrap"" arrangement. An S-wrap stage is where the resin and fibres, both in sheet form, pass around two separated rotating rollers in the shape of the letter ""S""s known as S-wrap rollers. Alternative rolle arrangements include the widely used ""nip"", wherein the fibre and resin are pinched, or nipped, together as they pass between the pinch point between two adjacent or opposing rotating rollers. The pressures induced in the resin and fibres can be controlled to cause the desired degree of disruption of the fibre. Parameters such as separation between rollers, speed, relative speed between rollers and resin and fibres and the contact area of the rollers can be vari ed to achieve the desired degree of (fibre) disruption and also resin impregnation.      It is understood that S-wrap provides ideal conditions for reliable and reproducible impregnation of the resin between the interstices of the fibres whilst also providing sufficient disruption.      However, nip stages are also possible, provided the pressures are kept low, e.g. by control over the gap between adjacent rollers.      Multiple sets of S-wra or nip rollers can be used, with each set gradually increasing the pressure applied to the resin. A typical process may also combine sets of S-wrap and Ni rollers in the same production line.      The pressure exerted onto the conductive fibres and resin preferably does not exceed 35 kg per centimetre of width of the conductive fibre layer, more preferably does not exceed 30 kg per centimetre. Rollers from 200 to 400 mm in diameter, more preferably from 220 to 350 mm, most preferably from 240 to 300 mm, have been found to provide the right conditions for achieving the desired disrupted fibre structures.   For example, when in S-wrap arraiigement, two rollers are preferably spaced apart to provide a gap between the centres of them of from 250 to 600 mm, preferably from 280 to 360 mm, most preferably from 300 to 340 mm, e.g. 320 mm.      Two adjacent pairs of S-wrap rollers are preferably separated between the centres of respective rollers of from 200 to 1200 mm, preferably from 300 to 900 mm, most, preferably from 700 to 900 mm e.g. S00 mm. The impregnation rollers may rotate in a variety of ways. They may be freely rotating or driven. If driven, they are conventionally driven so that there is no difference between the speed of rotation and the speed of passage of the resin and fibres over the rollers. Sometimes it may be desirable to apply an increase or decrease of speed of up to 40%, preferably up to 30%, preferably still up to 20%, preferably still up to 30% or most preferably of up to 5% relative to the passage of resin and fibres to promote impregnation or fibre conductivity. Such a difference is referred to in the art as ""trim"".      Following impregnation of resin into the fibres, often there is a cooling stage and further treatment stages such as laminating, slitting and separating.      In a further embodiment, the invention provides a stack of such moulding materials or structures.      The prepregs of the invention may be characterized by its resin content and/or its fibre volume and resia volume and/or its. degree of impregnation as measured by the water up take test.      Resin and fibre content of uncured prepregs or composites are determined in accordance with ISO 11667 (method A) for moulding materials or structures which contain fibrous material which does not comprise unidirectional carbon. Resin and fibre content of uncured prepregs or composite which contain unidirectional carbon fibrous material are determined   in accordance with DIN EN 2559 A. (code A). Resin and fibre content of cured composites which contain carbon fibrous material are detemiined in accordance with DIN EN 2564 A.      The fibre and resin volume % of a prepreg or composite can be determined from the weight % of fibre and resin by dividing the weight % by the respective density of the resin and carbon fibre.      The % of impregnation of a tow or fibrous material which is impregnated with resin is measured by means of a water pick up test.      The water pick up test is conducted as follows. Six strips of prepreg are cut to a size of 100 (+/-2) mm x 100 (+ -2) mm. Any backing sheet material is removed. The samples are weighed near the nearest 0.001 g (Wl). The ships are located between PTFE backed aimmniiuii plates so that 1 mm of the prepreg ship protrudes from the assembly of PTFE backed plates on one end and whereby the fibre orientation of the prepreg is extends along the protruding part. A clamp is placed on the opposite end, and 5 mm of the protruding part is immersed in water having a temperature of 23 C, relative air humidity of 50% +/- 35%, and at an ambient temperature of 23 X. After 5 minutes of immersion the sample is removed fi om the water and any exterior water is removed with blotting paper. The sample is then weighed again W2. The percentage of wate uptake WPU (%) is then calculated by averaging the measured weights for the six samples as follows: WPU (%)=[(<W2>- <W1 )/<Wl>)x 100. The WPU {%) is indicative of the Degree of Resin Impregnation (DRI). Typically, the values for the resin content by weight, for the uncured prepreg of the invention are in the ranges of from 15 to 70% by weight of the prepreg, from 18 to 68% by weight of the prepreg, from 20 to 65% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 60% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 55% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 50% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 45% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 40% by weight of the prepreg. from 25 to 35% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 30% by weight of the prepreg, from 30 to 55% by weight of the prepreg, from 32 to 35% by weight of the prepreg. from 35 to 50% by weight, of the prepreg and/or combinations of the aforesaid ranges.   Typically, the values for the resin content by volume for the uncured prepreg of the invention are in the ranges of from 15 to 70% by volume of the prepreg, from 18 to 68% by volume of the prepreg, from 20 to 65% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 60% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 55% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 50% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 45% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 40% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 35% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 30% by volume of the prepreg, from 30 to 55% by volume of the prepreg, from 35 to 50% by volume of the prepreg and/or combinations of the aforesaid ranges.      Water pick up values for the uncured prepreg moulding material and tows of the invention may be in the range of from 1 to 90%, 5 to 85%, 10 to 80%, 15 to 75%, 1 to 70%, 15 to 60%, 15 to 50%, 15 to 40%, 15 to 35%, 1 to 30%, 20 to 30%, 25 to 30% and/or combinations of the aforesaid ranges. In a further embodiment the invention provides a process wherein a layer of imidireetional fibrous tows which are fully impregnated with liquid resin are superimposed on a layer of dry unimpregnated unidirectional fibrous tows and the structure consolidated so that the resin penetrates the spaces between the unimpregnated tows but leaves the spaces between the filaments within the tows at least partially unimpregnated. A supporting web or scrim may be provided on one or both sides of the structure preferably before consolidation.      In a preferred embodiment the interior of the tows is at least partially resin free to provide an air venting path or structure, so that air that may be present in the tows from the outset or that may be introduced during impregnation with the liquid resin is not trapped within the structure by the resin and can escape during preparation and consolidation of the prepreg. The air is able to escape along the length of the tows and also from the second side of the fibrous layer if the impregnation by the resin is such that some or all of the surface of the second side of the fibrous layer is not carrying resin. Furthermore, the provision of the spaces between the filaments of the tows will allow air trapped between the prepregs during stack formation to escape particularly if, in addition, one side of the prepreg is not entir ely coated with resin.   Hie prepregs of this invention may be produced from normally available epoxy resins which may contain a hardener or curing agent and optionally an accelerator. In a preferred embodiment the epoxy .resin is free of a traditional hardener such as dicyandiamide and in particular we have found. <'>that desirable prepregs can be obtained by use of hardener -such as anhydrides, particularly polycarboxylic anhydrides; amines, particularly aromatic amines e.g. l,3-diariiiiiobenzene, <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000017_0001"" />and particularly the sulphones and methylene bisanilines, e.g. 4>4'-diaminodiphenyl sulphone (4,4' DDS), and 3,3 '-diarninodiphenyl sulphone (3,3' DDS), 4.4'-methylenebis (2-ineihyl-6- isopi pyla iline) (M-MIPA), 4.4'-methylenebis (3-chloro-2t6-diethylene aniline) ( - CDEA), 4, '-methylenebis (2,6 diemyleneaiiilhie) (M-DEA) and the phenol- formaldehyde resins, and/or combinations of the aforesaid curing agents. Preferred curing agents are the methylene bisanilines and the amino sulphones, particularly 4,4' DDS and 3,3' DDS. The relative amount of the curing agent and the epoxy resin that should be used will depend upon the reactivity of the resin, the desired shelf life, desired processing properties and the nature and quantity of the fibrous reinforcement in the prepreg.      In order to produce composites with substantially uniform mechanical properties it is important that the structural fibres and the epoxy resin be mixed to provide a substantially homogenous prepreg. The preferred prepreg of this invention contain a low level of voids between the tows. It is therefore preferred that eacli prepreg and the prepreg stack has a water pick-up value of less than 6% or less than 2%, more preferably less than 1 %, most preferably less than 0.5%. The water pick-up test determines the degree of wateiproofing or impregnation between the miidireetional tows of the prepregs of this invention. In this test, a specimen of prepreg material is initially weighed and clamped between two plates in such a way thai a strip 5 mm wide protrudes. This arrangement is suspended in the direction of the fibres in a water bath at room temperature (2IC) for 5 minutes. The specimen is then removed from the plates and weighed again and the difference in weight provides a value for the degree of impregnation within the specimen. The smaller the amomit of wa ter picked up, the higher the degree of waterproofing or impregnation.      The prepregs of this invention are intended to be laid-up with other composite materials (e.g. other prepregs which may also be according to this invention or they may be other      18   prepregs) to produce a curable laminate or a prepreg stack. The prepreg is typically produced as a roll of prepreg and in view of the tacky nature of such materials, a backing sheet is generally provided to enable the roll to be unfurled at the point of use. Thus, preferably the prepreg according to the invention may comprise a backing sheet on an external face to facilitate handling of the material and or rolling up of the material. The backing sheet ma comprise a polyolefin based material such as polyethylene, polypropylene and/or copolymers thereof. The backing sheet may comprise embossing. Tins has the advantage of providing the prepreg with an air venting surface structure. The air venting surface structure comprising embossed channels which allow air to escape during processing. This is particularly useful as this prevents inter-ply entrapment as inter- ply air is effectively removed via the air venting surface channels.      A preferred use of the prepregs of the present invention is as a tape; the prepregs can be prepared as a roll of ma terial prepared specifically for an automatic tape lay-up device. The prepregs are provided with backing sheets which are removed when they are laid up in the mould. Thus, the prepreg typically provided with a backing sheet is preferably sufficiently flexible so as to be able to form a roll with a diameter of less than 20 cm, preferably less than 10 cm. Known automatic lay-up apparatus requires the roll to satisfy-' particular dimensions. For example, the roll is either wound onto a 254 mm or 295 mm inside diameter core within a tolerance of 0.5 mm. As such, the composite material is preferably not so thick that it cannot easily be rolled. Thus typically the composite material has a thickness of from 0.5 to 5.0 mm. preferably from 0.5 to 4.0, most preferably from 1.0 to 3.0 mm. The roll can be cut to standard prepreg tape sizes which include 600 mm (24'<*>), 300 mm (12"")s 150 mm 75 mm (3""), 50 mm (2""), 25 mm (1""), 6.34 mm (1/4 "") and 3. IS mm (1/8"") in width, and cut within a tolerance of 0.050 mm and then laid-up as several layers of tape and cured. Tapes are frequently used in this way in the production of aircraft components.      The prepregs of this invention are produced by impregnating the fibrous material with the epoxy resin composition of the invention as previously described. The viscosity of the resin composition and the conditions employed for impregnation are selected to enable the desired degree of impregnation . It is preferred that during impregnation the resin containing   the conductive particles and optionally the thermoplastic toughening particles has a viscosity of from 0.1 Pa.s to 100 Pa.s, preferably from 6 to 100 Pa.s, more preferably from 18 to SO Pa.s and even more preferably from 20 to 50 Pa.s. In order to increase the rate of impregnation, the process may be carried out at an elevated temperature so that the viscosity of the resin is reduced. However it must not be so hoi for a sufficient length of time that premature curing of the resin occurs. Thus, the inipregnation process is preferably earned out at temperatures in the range of from 40C to 110C more preferably 60C to 80C. it is preferred that the resin content of the prepregs is such that after curing the structure contains from 30 to 40 wt %, preferably 31 to 37 wt % more preferably 32 to 35 wt % of the resin. The relative amount of resin and multifilament tow, the impregnation line speed the viscosity of the resin and the density of the multifilament tows should he correlated to achieve the desired degree of impregnation between the tows and to provide the interleaf layer of resin that is essentially free of the fibres providing the reinforcement. The epoxy resin used in resin composition of the invention and/or in the preparation of the prepreg preferably has an Epoxy Equivalent Weight (EEW) in the range from 10 to 1500, preferably it has an EEW in the range of from 50 to 500. Preferably the resin composition comprises the epoxy resin and an accelerator or curing agent. Suitable epoxy resins may comprise blends of two or more epoxy resins selected from nionofcneiional, difunctional, trifunctional and/or tetrafunctional epoxy resins.

Difunctional epoxy resins may be selected from diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A. diglycidyl dihydroxy naphthalene, or any combination thereof.   Suitable trifunctional epoxy resins, by way of example, may include those based upon phenol and cresol epoxy novolacs, glyeidyl ethers of phenol-aldehyde adducts, aromatic epoxy resins, aliphatic triglycidyl ethers, dialipliatic triglycidyl ethers, aliphatic polyglycidyi amines, heterocyclic glycidyi imidines and amides, glyeidyl ethers, iloorinated epoxy resins, or any combination thereof.

The aforesaid hardeners may be present in relation to the resin system, such that the resin contains hardener in the range of from 10 to 25 weight % in relation to the resin, preferably from 10 to 20 weight %, and more preferably from 15 to 20 weight % in relation to the resin.      In a preferred embodiment, the resin may comprise a combination of one or more of the following components: a base resin component in the form of a tri-g!ycidyl aminophenoi in the range of from 8 to 34% by weight, of the resin, a further base resin component in the form of a bis-phenol epoxy in the range of from 20 to 28% by weight of the resin, a further base resin component in the form of a tetra-glycidyl amine in the range of from 25 to 35% by weight of the resin, a toughener in the form of a polyethersulphone in the range of from 10 to 25% by weight of the resin, a curative in the form of methyl anhydride (NMA) or   cu.nmodiphenylsmfone in the range of from 2 to 28% by weight of the resin. The resin may further comprise a polyaniide as herein described in the range of from 10 to 15% by weight of the resin. A preferred exemplary resin is composed of: 25 to 35 wt% tetrafimctional epoxy resin; .18 to 28 wt% difunciional epoxy resin; 4 to 18 wt% polyethersiufone (PES) 2 to 10 wt.% polvamide 12 (PA 12) particles; 2 to 10 wt% polyamide 11 (PAl l) particles; 1 to 8 wt% potato-shaped graphite (PSG) particles; and 17.4 to 27.4 wt% curing agent.

Polyamide particle sizes of irom 5-30 microns are preferred for these formulation. Polyamide particle sizes of from 10-20 microns are even more preferred.      Where disruptive or disrupted fibres are employed in this invention they may be derived from the reinforcing fibres and particularly carbon filament tows and they provide conductive filaments located at the surface of the carbon fibre layer. These filaments extend into the resin interlayer so that when cured under elevated temperature, a cured composite material is produced comprising a aired structural layer of packed conductive- fibres and an interlayer of cured resin, the interlayer of cured resin, comprising the disruptive fibres dispersed therein together with the electiOconductive particles.   The disruptive fibres are believed to form electrical contacts between, themselves and also with the conductive particles and thus providing electrical conductivity across the interiayer so increasing the electrical conductivity in the ""Z"" direction of the cured composite material. If two such pfepregs. are laid together, the first oute layer of resin of one prepreg, and if present an oute layer of resin of the other prepreg, form a resin interleaf layer between two layers of electrically conductive fibres.      The conductive disrupted filaments may be prepared by manipulation of an outer face of the structural layer of conductive fibres to generate fibres by disrupting a proportion of the reinforcing fibres.      Tims, in a second aspect, the invention relates to a process for producing a prepreg, the process comprising passing a sheet of electrically conductive fibres to a fibre disrupting means. This causes a proportion of the fibres or fibrils on an external face of the sheet to become disrupted filaments. The fibres are subsequently impregnated with the thermosetting resin of this invention, thus generating an outer layer of resin in contact with the external face of the sheet comprising the structural fibres which also comprises the disrupted filaments, and wherein the tliemiosetting resin additionally contains electrically conductive particles.      The electrically conductive particles preferably have a size whereby at least 50% of the particles present in the resin have a size within 20  or 10  or 5  of the thickness of the resin interleaf layer. In other words the difference between the thickness of the resin interleaf layer and the size of the electrically conductive particles is less than 10 . Preferably the electrically conductive particles have a size whereby at least 50% of the particles present in the resin have a size within 5 um of the thickness of the resin layer. The resin interleaf layer can be measured by microscopy analysis and is well known in the art. The size of at least 50% of the electrically conductive paiticies is therefore such thai they bridge across the interleaf thickness and the particles are in contac t with an upper fibrous reinforcement ply and a lower fibrous reinforcement ply arranged about the resin layer.   The disrupting means manipulates the fibres at an external face to become filaments which may be free filaments or may remain attached to the base carbon fibre. The term ""free <>filaments"" means -filaments which are not physically or chemically bound to any oilier body and are essentially mobile. Free filaments thus formed are not adhered to any other fibres and are freely mobile.      For example, tire free fibres typically have a distribution of lengths with a mean length of less than 2.0 cm, preferably less than 1.0 cm, more preferably less than 0.5 cm.      The disruption means may generate the disrupted filaments in a number of ways depending on how the structural fibres are arranged, for example by breaking points of adhesion between structural fibres and breaking structural fibres into shorter lengths, or by forming loop, or individual breaks which permit free ends of filaments to migrate into the interlayer.      Thus, the invention can involve actively generati g fuzz or broken fibres. As is described in WO2011/1141 0, which is hereby incorporated by reference, the conductive fibres are unidirectional fibres and the disruption means involves passing the fibres over an abrasion surface, thereby causing breakage of a proportion of the fibres on the external face passing in contact with the abrasion surface, whilst the fibres not in contact with the abrasion surface remain unbroken. it has been found that breaking from 0.5 to 5.0 t. % of the fibres in at least one location provides good results.      As discussed above, unidirectional fibre sheets are typically formed from a plurality of tows of fibres, which are spread out to merge together, prior to impregnation with resin. A common method of achieving this is to pass the fibres over a plurality of sequential spreader bars or rollers.   It is therefore convenient for the abrasion surface to be incorporated in an existing spreader bar arrangement. Thus, in a preferred, embodiment, the abrasion surface is the surface of a spreader bar. Furthermore, it. has been found that if the abrasion surface spreader ba is positioned late in di sequence of spreader bars, then further improvements in conductivity can be obtained. Thus, preferably the abrasion surface spreader bar is in the last three, preferably in the last two. and most preferably is the last spreader bar in a spreader bar sequence. The abrasion surface may be made from any suitable material, such as metal or ceramic, however tungsten carbide is preferred.      In a. preferred embodiment, the process involves passing the sheet of electric-ally conductive fibres to a second fibre disrupting means to cause a proportion of the fibres on the other external face of the sheet to become free fibres.      Tims, at least two spreader bars may comprise abrasion surfaces, each one in contact with each of the external faces of the sheet of conductive fibres. However, it has been found that the roughness of the abrasive surface is a key parameter and thus preferably the abrasive surface has a Ra roughness of at least 1.5 micrometres, more preferably at least 2.5 micromeires.      Another important factor is the relative speed of movement of the fibres over the surface. Preferably the relative speed of movement is from 2 to 20 m/'min.      Once the sheet of electrically conductive fibres comprising free fibres on one or both external faces is prepared, the next stage is resin impregnation as previously described. The good mechanical properties are generally attributed to the presence of interlayers which are free of structural fibres, and contain toughening materials such as thermoplastic particles that, are insoluble in the resin. However, these traditional interlayers contribute to   the poor ""Z"" direction electrical conductivity because they provide a spacing between adjacent layers of conductive fibres. The present invention overcomes this problem without affecting the good mechanical performance provided by the interiayer by providing the disruptive fibres and providing electrically conductive particles in the resin. Thus the invention is equally applicable if the impregnation process is a one-stage or two-stage process.      In a preferred embodiment where an additional toughening particulate material is included in the resin composition of the invention,, the additional toughening material can be of a wide variety of materials.      Where the additional toiighening material is a polymer it should be insoluble in the matrix resin, typically an epoxy resin at room temperature and at the elevated temperatures at which flie resin is cured. Depending upon the melting point of the thermoplastic polymer. it may melt or soften to varying degrees during curing of the resin at elevated temperatures and re-solidify as the cured laminate is cooled. Suitable thermoplastics should not dissolve in the resin, and include thermoplastics, such as polyamides (PAS), and polyefherimide (PEI). Polyamides such as nylon 6 (PA6) and nylon 12 (PA 12) and nylon 11 (PA11) and/or mixtures thereof are preferred.      The reinforcing fibres may be synthetic or natural fibres or any other form of materia] or combination of materials that, combined with the resin composition of the invention, forms a composite product. The reinforcement web can either be provided via spools of fibre that are unwound or from a roll of textile. Exemplary fibres include glass, carbon, graphite, boron, ceramic and aramid. Preferred fibres are carbon and glass fibres particularly carbon fibres. Hybrid or mixed fibre systems may also be envisaged. The use of cracked (i.e. stretch-broken) or selectively discontinuous fibres may be advantageous to facilitate lay- up of the product according to the invention and improve its capability of being shaped. Although a unidirectional fibre alignment is preferable, other forms may also be used. Typical textile forms include simple textile fabrics, knit fabrics, twill fabrics and satin weaves. It is also possible to envisage using non-woven or non-crimped fibre layers. The surface mass of fibre filaments within the fibrous reinforcement is generally 80 to 4000   g/m<2>, preferably 100 to 2500 g/m<2>, and especially preferably 150 to 2000 g m<2>. The filaments are arranged in Sows. The number of carbon filaments per tow can vary from 3000 to 320,000, again preferably from 6,000 to 160,000 and most preferably from 12,000 to 48,000. For fibreglass reinforcements, fibres of 600 to 2400 tex axe particularly adapted. Carbon fibre is preferred if the prepregs and composites are used in aerospace components..      The tows may be spread to form light weight reinforcement material, typically having a weight in the range of from 10 to 200 g/nr (gsm), preferably of from 15 to 150 g m<2>, more preferably fr om 20 to 100 g m<2> or fiom 30 to 80 g/m<2> and/or combinations of the aforesaid ranges. One or more resin layers may be reinforced by containing this light weight fabric. The light weight reinforcement may comprise carbon reinforcement. Oilier resin layers may contain carbon reinforcement of a heavier area weight as hereinbefore described.      Advantageously, the carbon fibre reinforcement may be in the form of a spread fabric or fiat fibre tow fabric such as the fabric as disclosed in WO 98/46817, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of such spread fabric are 268 gsi , 194 gsm, 134 gsm and 75 gsm as derived from T700 carbon fibre as supplied by Toray. Alternatively, commercial fabrics such as mwltiaxial non-crimp fabrics (NCF) C-Ply 268 gsm (2 x 134 gsm, 0+/- 45), C-Ply 1 0 (2 x 75) 0/20/0/25 derived from the same T700 fibres as supplied by Chomarat; or Textreme 160 ( 2 x 80 gsm plies 0/90), or Textreme 160 ( 2 x 80 gsm plies 0/90) derived from the same T700 fibres as supplied by Oxeon SE.      Spread tow fabrics and tapes can be produced using HS (high strength), IM (intermediate modulus) and HM (high modulus) carbon fibres as well as other types of high performance fibres. Spread tow carbon unidirectional materials may be available in the following fibre types and weights: Intermediate modulus carbon > 21 gsm, high strength carbon > 40 gsm, high modulus carbon > 65 gsm, heavy tow (> 48k filaments) > 100 gsm.      Spread tow carbon fabrics may be available in the following fibre types and weights. For high strength carbon fabrics: (from 12k filaments) 80 gsm, 160 gsm and 240 gsm, (from 15k filaments) 100 gsm, (from 24k filaments) 160 gsm and 320 gsm and for heavy tows 200 gsm and more. For intermediate modulus carbon fabrics: (from 12k filaments) 43 gsm,   (from 18k . filaments) 76 and 152 gsm, (from 24fc filaments) 82 gsin and 1 4 gsm. For high modulus carbon fabrics: from 12k - 130 gsm. The fibre angles may range from unidirectional to 0/90 and 45/45 fabrics. Alternative angles may also be used such as +45/- 45, +3G/-6G, +50/-25, etc.      The interleave or iiiierlayer which may be formed by combining carbon reinforced resin layers whereby the carbon reinforcement is of a light weight, may differ from the interleave of resin layers containing a heavier carbon fibre reinforcement. The interleave may have a thickness in the range of from 10 to 45 , preferably from 1      Particles which may be present in the interleave may have a size in the range of from 15 to 30 , preferably from 15 to 25 . The particles may comprise toughners, electrically conductive particles and/or combinations of the aforesaid particles.      Exemplary layers of unidirectional fibrous tows are made from HexTow carbon fibres, which are available from Hexcel Coiporafion. Suitable HexTow carbon fibres for use in making unidirectional fibre tows include: IM7 carbon fibres, which are available as tows mat contain 6,000 or 12,000 filaments and weigh 0.223 g/m and 0.446 g/m respectively; IM8-IM10 carbon fibres, which are available as tows that contain 12,000 filaments and weigh from 0.446 g m to 0.324 g/m; and AS? carbon fibres, which are available in tows that contain 12,000 filaments and weigh 0.800 g/m, tows containing up to 80,000 or 50,000 (50K) filaments may be used such as those containing about 25,000 filaments available from Toray and those containing about 50,000 filaments available from Zoltek. The tows typically have a width of from 3 to 7 mm and are fed for impregnation on equipment employing combs to hold the tows and keep them parallel and unidirectional.      Once prepared the prepreg may be rolled-up, so that it can be stored for a period of time. it can then be unrolled and cut as desired and optionally laid up with other prepiegs to form a prepreg stack in a mould or in a vacuum bag which is subsequently placed in a mould and cured.      28   Once prepared, the prepreg or prepreg stack may be cured, by exposure to an elevated temperature, and optionally elevated pressure, to produce a cured composite laminate. As discussed above, the prepregs of the present invention can provide excellent mechanical properties without requiring the high pressures encountered in an autoclave process.      Thus, in further aspect, the invention relates to a process of curing the thermosetting resin within a prepreg or prepreg stack as described herein, the process involving exposing the prepreg or prepreg stack to a temperature sufficient to induce curing of the thermosetting resin composition and is preferably carried out at a pressure of less than 10 or 7 or 3.0 bar absolute.      The curing process may be carried out at a pressure of less than 10 or 7 o 3.0 or 2.0 bar absolute, preferably less than 1 bar absolute. In a particularly preferred embodiment the pressure is less than atmospheric pressure. The curing process may be carried out at one or more temperatures in the range of from 150 to 260C, preferably from ISO to 220 C, more preferably from 160 to 210C for a time sufficient to cure the thermosetting resin composition to the desired degr ee. Curing at a pressure close to atmospheric pressure can be achieved by the so-called vacuum bag technique. This involves placing the prepreg or prepre stack in an air-tight bag and creating a vacuum on the inside of the bag. This has the effect that the prepreg stack experiences a consolidation pressure of up to atmospheric pressure, depending on the degree of vacuum applied. The vacuum bag techniques can also be applied within an autoclave.      Once aired, the prepreg or prepreg stack becomes a composite laminate, suitable for use in a structural application, for example an aerospace structure. Such composite laminates c an comprise structural fibres at a level of from 45% to 75% by volume (fibre volume fraction), preferably from 55% to 70% by volume, more preferably from 60% to 68% by volume (DEN EN 2564 A).   The laminates produced from the prepregs of this invention preferably contain less than 1% by volume of voids, or less than 0.7% by volume of voids, typically less than 0.1% by volume and. particularly less than 0.05% by volume based on the total volume of the .laminate as measured by microscopic analysis of 20 spaced cross sections measuring 30 x 40 ram in cross section (spacing 5 cm) of a cured sample of the laminate.      The unique properties of the lightweight layers used in this invention make it possible to cure the laminates using such layers in an out-of-autoelave process. This relatively lo pressure and low cost curing process can be used because- the damage tolerance (e.g. Compression After Impact. - CAT) of the cured laminate is not substantially less than the damage tolerance achieved using the higher pressure and higher expense of an autoclave. In contrast, out-of-autociave curing of laminates that have interleaf zones toughened with insoluble<'> thermoplastic particles produces cured laminates that have<'> damage tolerances that are significantly reduced.      Within this application the electrical conductivity of composite laminates in the ""Z"" direction is measured by the following method. A panel is prepared from multiple unidirectional prepreg layers so that the fibre orientations of subsequent layers in 0/90. The panel is cured by autoclave aire at a temperature of 180C for 2 hours under a pressure of 0.7 MPa to form a cured panel of 300 mm x 300 mm x 3rnm in size. Specimens (four) for test are then cut from the panel so that these are sized as 40 mm x 40 mm x 3 mm. The square faces of the specimens are sanded on a finisher machine to expose the carbon fibres. Excess sanding is prevented as this would penetrate past the first ply into the first mtralaminar layer. The square faces are then coated with a. metal such as gold via thermal sputtering to a thickness of approximately 30 nm or tin-zinc to a thickness of at least. 10 micrometers via arc-spraying. Any metal on the sides of the specimens is removed by sanding prior to testing.      Each side of the specimens is contacted with a copper braid or wire to form electrodes which extend diagonally across the metal plated surfaces. A power source (TTz EL-302P   programmable 30V/2A power supply unit, Thurlby Tliandar Instnmienis, Cambridge, UK) which is capable of varying both voltage and current is used to detemime the resistance. Two or four electrodes can be used per sample, the latter is preferred as it is more reproducible. The power source is contacted with the electrodes and held in place using a clamp. The clamp has a non-conductive coating or layer to prevent an electrical path from one braid to the other. A current of one ampere is applied and the voltage noted. Using Ohm's Law resistance can then be calculated (R= V/T). The test, is carried out on each of the cut specimens to give a range of values. To ensure confidence in the test each specimen is tested two times. To verify the measurement, the resistivity is also measured using a Flux Multimeter by placing one electrode on one plated surface and the other electrode on the opposite plated surface.      From the calculated resistance [Ohm], the conductivity [Siemens] is calculated as Conductivity () = thickness of specimen (t)/resistance (R) x area of specimen (A) The cross ply conductivity is calculated by dividing the conductivity value by the thickness of the laminate (3 mm), so through thickness conductivity =  /thickness.      Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a process which may be used to manufacture prepregs of the present invention.      Figure 2 is a schematic representation of another process which may be used<'> to manufacture prepregs of the present invention.      Ti iing to Figure 1, the process proceeds from right, to left beginning with a creel unit 8 which can support 370 spools of carbon fibre tows, each tow having 12,000 individual carbon filaments. Each fibre bobbin on the creel is tensioned by a strap and spring arrangement to provide a uniform tow to tow fibre tension to the machine. The tows of fibre pas from the creel to a comb. Before they enter the comb a measurement of individual tow tension is taken at location 10 in Figure 1. Individual 12k carbon fibre tow tensions are measured here with a hand held fibre tensiomeier. Fibre break load on the creel from the strap and spring assembly is controlled to provide a fibre tension at this point of around 160 g/tow.   A random selection of ten tows from each of the process webs Is measured for quality control and checking the nominal fibre tow tension is at the preferred individual tow tension of 160 g/tow. The fibre tows then pass through, a comb 12. The fibre comb acts to separate the carbon fibre tows and align them into the fibre spreading bar section and control the overall fibre web width so that prepreg fibre area! weight is within required tolerances. The fibre tows then pass onto a load cell roller 14 which measures the global overall applied tension to the carbon fibres. The fibres then pass through spreader bars 16. These bars control fibre tensioning and spreading to control the final fibre tension and alignment of fibres before they make contact with the resin coated films at the pinch point 22.      The two bars forming pinch point.22 are locked so they do not rotate, other bars before this do rotate. The first spreader bar 16 is a load cell roller to monitor overall global fibre tension incoming to the spreader bar system. The fibre tows are heated in tins spreader bar section by an infrared heater (not shown) in preparation for impregnation by the resin composition of the invention. The infrared heater softens the fibre sizing in order to help promote good fibre impregnation. The fibre sizing is an epoxy solution that is applied to the carbon fibre at. point of manufacture to aid fibre handling but in some instances the sizing can restrict fibre spreading and impregnation.      The two pre-coated resin film rolls are loaded to the prepreg machine unwinds, one above the prepreg web 18 and one below the prepreg web 20. These film rolls provide resin that is fed by top film unwind 18 and bottom film unwind 20. The resin and fibres meet at pinch point 22. No significant impregnation occurs at this point.      Pre-coated resin films are at nominally 69 gsm for this 268 fibre area! weight product so that 34% resin content by weight is achieved in the final product. The resin is coated onto the right side of a super calendared double sided differential value silicone release coated paper. Film roll braking tensions at unwinds 18 and 20 are controlled and matched with the final fibre web tension in order to run a crease free prepreg web through the hot S-wrap impregnation zone 24. 28.   The resin and fibres then pass through the first S-wrap compactor 24 and then through another infrared heating stage 26 for further heating. The prepreg is heated under the TR heater to 120 to 130C so that resin viscosity is reduced before the web enters the 2<nd>., 3<rd> and 4<i34> heated S-wrap roll sets, as shown in Figure 1 , for resin impregnation into the structural fibrous layer of  2k carbon fibre tows. At this stage of the process, after the IR heater 26, the resin has a low enough viscosity for impregnation into the fibres.      The resin and fibres pass through three more S-wrap compactors 28 where the impregnation occurs to produce disrupted fibre layers with reliable and sufficient impregnation. These S-wrap roller sets are heated to 135 to I40C, are 270 mm diameter and are separated to form a gap between them of 350 to 450 mm.      The rotational speed on these rollers are controlled so that web wrapping forces are high in order for these forces to act on the prepreg web for disruption of the structural fibre layer and cause high resin flow into the carbon fibres for good impregnation to be achieved. The disruption of the structural fibre layer by the S-wrap wrapping forces has been found to be required for low resistance values and impregnation is needed for success in the automated prepreg tape laying operation in customer processes. The fibre and resin then passes over a chilled plate 30. The prepreg web is chilled on this chill plate to cool the prepreg to 20 to 22C so that a process paper can be removed prior to further conventional processing prepreg processing stages that follow the chill plate and which are not shown here but are known to the skilled person.      We shall discuss the process of Figure 2 (Process 2) in relation to the below Examples.      Examples      In the following examples prepregs were prepared using two different processes illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 corresponding to Process 1 and Process 2 respectively. Common to both processes the fibre tows are supplied from a creel 100 (or 8 of figure 1) which contains multiple spools holding the fibre tows. Each fibre tow contains multiple carbon fibre filaments (12000 filaments) which each have a diameter of about 5 microns. The tows are spread out by conducting the tows over spreader bars. The spreader bars are cylindrical   bars which have a smooth surface (smface roughness of less than 0.1 microo). Hie tension in the fibres, and the path of the fibre tows over the bars causes the fibre tows to flatten arid tints spread. Spreader bars are widely used to flatten and spread fibre tows.      Followin the spreader bars, the fibres were impregnated on both sides by resin films of this invention 104 (or 18 and 22 of Figure I). The resin films contained thermoplastic particles (PA 6 or PA 11) and the resins of the Examples of the invention also contained co ductive particles. The first stage of impregnation is common to both processes, whereby the fibres and resin were ran over an S shaped compactor (S wr ap) 106 (or 24 of Figure 1) and through an infrared heating chamber 107 (or 26 of figure 1). The heating of the resin encouraged the resin to How into the fibres. The remaining steps of impregnation wa performed by either of the methods depic ted in Figure I or 2. Figure 2, referred to herein as Process 2, passed the resin and fibres through 3 nip rollers (3 N) 1 10, which compacted and further compressed the resi into the fibres. Figure 1 , referred to herein as Process 1, passed the resin and fibres through 3 further S -wraps (28) which compacted and further compressed the resin into the fibres. The impregnated fibres were then chilled by a chill plate 1 12 (or 30 of figure i).      Following this step, backing papers were rewound 114 and the prepreg was backed with polythene backing 116 (not shown on figure 1)      The products of the invention contain conductive particles in combination with the thermoplastic particles. A product is a prepreg containing an uncured thermosetting resin and a carbon fibre of the areal weight 268 g/niA The thermosetting resin contains a blend of Afunctional epoxy resin (from Huntsman), bisphenol-F epoxy, and 4,434DS curative. The resin contains a thermoplastic additive in the form of polyethersulphone (PES), which is dissolved in the thermosetting resin, in addition the product contains thennoplastic paiticles in the form of polyamide such as PA 6 ( nylon 6) or PA 11 (nylon 11) in a concentration of 9.5 to 13.5 weight % based on the resin. The volume average diameter of   the thermoplastic particles is 20 microns as determined by Coulter measurement (laser diffraction analysis).      The Examples compare the ""Z"" direction conductivity and mechanical performance in systems in which the fibres are smooth or disrupted and ""di&i iption"" in the fibre beds on either side of the resin layer, may be inferred from microphotographs. The interlayers are formed when prepregs plies are stacked up together. The conductive fibre elements appear to include broken fibre filaments and/or fibre filaments which have been displaced as a result of the force exerted during impregnation of the fibre tows with resin.      The lay up of the prepregs is a 0/90 configuration.      The resistance and conductivity in the Examples were determined as follows.      Conductivity of composite laminates test method      The conductivity is measured by coating samples with a metal and attaching electrodes to the sample. We have found that the values obtained vary according to the metal used and the thickness of the metal coating and accordingly measurements should be made on samples using the same metal and provided with a metal layer of substantially the same thickness.      A panel is prepared by autoclave cure that is 300 mm x 300 mm x 3 mm in size. The lay- up of the panel is 0/90. Specimens (typically four) for test are then cut from the panel that are 40 mm x 40 nun. The square faces of the specimens should be sanded (for example on a Linisher machine) to expose the carbon fibres. This is not necessary if peel ply is used during the cure. Excess sanding should be avoided as this will penetrate past the first ply. The square faces are then coated with an electrically conductive metal a thin (approximately 3 am) layer of gold via a sputterer (Technique 1) or a 120 micron thick layer of tin-zinc (70:30) applied by arc spraying (Technique 2 ). Any gold or tin zinc on the sides of the specimens should be removed by sanding prior to testing. The metal coating is required to ensure low contact resistance. The tin- zinc arc spraying technique i preferred as we have found that there is lesson significant variability in the results as opposed to   samples which were coated by gold sputtering and tested for conductivity as herein described.      A power source (TTi EL302-P programmable 30V 2A power supply unit, Tburlby Tliandar Instruments, Cambridge, UK) that is capable of varying both voltage and current is used to determine the resistance. The specimen, is contacted with the electrodes (tinned copper braids) of the power source and held in place using a clamp (one must ensure the electrodes do not touch each other or contact other metallic surfaces as this will give a false result). Two or four electrodes per specimen were used, the latter was preferred as it is more reproducible. Ensure the clamp has a non-conductive coating or layer to prevent an electrical path from one braid to the other. A current of one ampere is applied and the voltage noted. Using Ohm's Law resistance can then be calculated (V/l). The test is carried out on each of the cut specimens to give range of values. Each specimen is tested two times. To verify the measurement, the resistivity<7> is also measured using a Flux Multimeter by placing one electrode on one plated surface and the other electrode on the opposite plated surface. From the resistance (R) a conductivity value can be calculated as defined herein before.      Example 1      A prepreg which contains an uncured thermosetting resin composition of the invention and a carbon 7 fibre of the area! weight 268 g/ni<2> was prepared on an experimental pilot prepreg hue. The thermosetting resin contained a blend of trifimctional epoxy resin (from Huntsman), bisphenol-F epoxy, and 44DDS curative. The resin contained a thermoplastic additive in the form ofpoiyethersulphone (PES), which was dissolved in the thermosetting resin. In addition the product contained thermoplastic particles in the form of polyamide PA 6 (nylon 6) in a concentration of 13.5 weight % based on the total weight of the formulated thermosetting resin (which also contains the additive particles). The volume average diameter of the thermoplastic particles was 20 microns as determined by Coulter measurement (laser diffraction analysis). The prepreg was produced in accordance with Process 1 as described hereinbefore. We have observed that the Z-direciion electrical conductivity of this material is in the range of 1-6 S/ni.   Example la      This product is a prepreg which is identical i composition to Example 1. However, the product is produced, by a process that includes two rough spreader bars (RSB) and the step. of doubling up of the fibre tows by additio al smooth fibre spreading bars (NFS). The rough spreader bars have a surface roughness of 4 microns as opposed to the smooth spreader<'> bars which have a roughness of approximately 0.1 micron. Before the fibre is fed into the impregnation line, the fibre tows ran through the spreader bar arrangement which includes the rough spreader bars, in the NFS pattern around the spreader bars forming an undulating surface in the fibre layer. Following fibre spreading, the unidirectional fibre tows are impregnated by two resin films on either side of the fibres as it is fed between nip rollers. The ""Z"" direction electrical conductivity of tins maieriai is in the range of from of 4-15 S/m and the fibres are disrupted as is observed from micrographs of a cured quasi isotropic laminate.      Example lb      Prepreg was produced in the same way as in Examples I, la; however this time conductive particles were also added to the prepregs of Examples 1, la. The resulting product contained iliemiopiasiic particles in the form of polyamide 6 (PA 6) in a concentration of 13.5 wt % based on the thermosetting resin. The resin further contained glassy carbon particles (CMS) having a volume average diameter of 15 or 30 microns as determined by Coulter measurement using a Becknian Coulter. The concentration of the particles varied from 1 wt % to 3 wt %.      Carbon microspheres (CMS) were supplied by HTW Hochiemperaiur-Werkstoffe of Germany and are called Sigradur G (10-20) that have an average particle size of 15 microns and Sigradur G (20-50) that have an average particle size of 30 microns as determined with a Beckman Coulter.      Conductivity achieved was between 5.0-12.1 S/m at a loading range of 0.5-3.0 weight % in relation to the resin. The results are presented in the below Table 1.

Example 2      The CMS used in Example lb was replaced with potato shaped graphite (PSG), SG25/99.95 SC, of average particle size 20  obtained from NGS Naturgraphit of Germany) with the following results:      38   Prepreg system Technique 2 Technique 1      4 point 2 point      Conductivity S/ni Conductivity S/ni     No disrupted fibres with 0.5 0.4      LQ wt % PSG      Di.smpt.ed fibres by Process 1 with 4.0 3.1      1.0 wt % PSG      Table 2      The prepress of Example 2 were all prepared in the same way as in Examples 1,1a. Additional Examples      Prepregs (20 ni 0.3 m) with different amounts of conductive particles were manufactured on the pilot prepreg line employed in Example LI a, lb by feeding a continuous layer of unidirectional carbon fibres and bringing into contact with two layers of curable resin containing the electrically conductive particles and thermoplastic toiighner pailicles (Rilsan PA 1  or Orgasol PA 6 from Arkema) in a so-called 2 film process.      The potato shaped graphite (PSG) was supplied by NGS Naturgraphit of Germany and are called SG25/99.95 SC and have an average particle size of 20 microns. Another PSG was supplied by Nippon Power Graphite Company of Japan and called GHDR-15-4.      Planar graphites were supplied by Tirncal Ltd of Switzerland and are called Timrex SFG44 and Timrex KS44. These particles have an average particle size of 22 microns. Another planar graphite was supplied by Graphit Kropfmulil of Germany and is called SGA20 M and has an average particle size of 20 microns.      The prepreg was made using IMA carbon fibre at an area! weight of 268 gsm. For resistance panels 12 ply laminates were produced using 0/90 lay-up and cured at 180C for 2 hours in an autoclave at 3 bar pressure.   Prepregs were made by process  or 2. The prepregs made Process 1 were prepared containing the conductive particles wherein the pressure exerted onto the carbon .fibres and resin did not exceed 40 kg per centimetre of the width of the carbon fibre layer. In this case, the disruption of the fibres was much less severe when compared to prepreg prepared by the 2 .film Nip process of .Figure 2 (Process 2). In addition, for comparison, prepregs were made containing no conductive particles but prepared by using rough spreader bars (RSB) on the carbon tows and using Process 2. In addition, for comparison prepregs, made by Process 2 were prepared containing 'planar' conductive particles. Example 3      Tliis product is a prepreg produced on a pilot prepreg line containing an uncured thermosetting resin and a carbon fibre IMA. The area! weight of the fibre was 268 g m<2>. In addition the product contained thermoplastic particles in the form of PA I I in a concentration of 13.5 wt % based on the thermosetting resin.      The product was produced by the Process 2      The impregnated fibre was heated to improve the flow of the resin films into the fibres. Subsequently, the impregnated fibre passed through a set of ""S wrap rollers"" to align the unidirectional fibres and further enhance homogeneity and impregnation of the prepreg material. Subsequently, following heating of the fibres by an IR table to improve resin flow, the material was passed through 3 sets of nip rollers of Figure 2. Finally , the paper backing layers were removed and a polythene backing sheet (polyethylene sheeting) was applied to form the final prepreg product. This is common to all examples employing Process 2.

The areal weight of the fibre is 268 g/nr. In addition the product contained thermoplastic paiticles in the form of PA6 in a concentration of 13.5 wt % based on the thermosetting resin. The prepreg also contained PSG SG25/99.95 SC in a concentration of 1 wt% based on thermosetting resin. Tins product was produced using the (S-wrap) 2 film process.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000040_0001"" />    Table 4      Example 5-9      These prepregs had an area! weight of the fibre of 268 g/ni<2>. These products contained thermoplastic particles in the form of PA I I in a eoiiceiitratioii of 9.5 wt % based on the thermosetting resin. The prepreg also contained PSG SG25/99.95 SC in varying   concentrations of between I to 4 wt% based on thermosetting resin. This product was produced using the (S-wrap) 2 film process of Figure 1.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000041_0001"" />    Table 5      It is shown in Table 5 that iiicreasmg the conieiii of the PSG increases the conductivity of the composite. A maximum conductivity of 29 S m is achieved at 3 wt% loading of PSG. Increasing the loading of the PSG above 3 t% does not improve conductivity value further.   Examples 10 to 12      These prepregs were prepared as in Example 3, using a fibre layer of 268 g ni<2> areal weight These prepregs contained themioplastic particles in the form of PA  having a concentration varying from 9.5 to 13.5 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight. The prepreg contains PSG SG25/99.95 SC in concentrations of between 3 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight. This product was produced using the 2 film Nip process.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000042_0001"" />    Table 6      Table 6 shows by using Process 2 in combination with PSG particles, that conductive values greater than 100 S/m can be achieved. By lowering the themioplastic particle content conductivity can also be increased. Example 13      This prepreg was prepared as for Example 3, using a fibre layer of 268 g/iir areal .weight. The product contained thermoplastic particles in the form of PA 6 in a concentration of 10.5 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight. The prepreg contained PSG   SG25/99.95 SC in a concentration of 3 wt % based on the formulated memiosett g resin weight. This product was produced using the 2 film Nip process.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000043_0001"" />    Table 7      Table 7 shows by the combination of Process 2 with PSG particles can produce a prepreg with conductivity values greater than 90 S/m. This confirms that using a different thermoplastic particle does not significantly affect conductivity values.      Example 14      This prepreg was prepared as for Example 3, using a fibre of 268 g/m<2> area! weight . The product contains thermoplastic particles in the form of PA l 1 in a concentration of 10.5 wt % based on the thermosetting resin. The prepreg contains PSG GHDR-I5-4 in a concentration of 3 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight. This product was produced using the 2 film Nip process.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000043_0002"" />    Table 8   Table 8 shows that the combiiiaiioii of Process 2 with PSG GHD -I5-4 particles to the prepreg, conductivity values greater than 100 S in can be achieved.      Examples 15 to IS      These prepregs were prepared as for Example 3, using a fibre layer of 268 g/rn<2> areal weight. The product contained thermoplastic particles in the fomi of PA 11 in a concentration of 10.5 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight. The prepregs contained graphite particles with a planar shape rather tha a potato shape, which were applied with a concentration of 3 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight. These products were produced using the 2 film Nip process.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000044_0001"" />    Table 9   Table 9 shows by the combination of Process 2 and the addition of planar conductive particles to a prepreg achieves conductivity values of only 36 S/iii. This demonstrates that the shape of the particle is important and that spherical or spheroidal particles can result in composites having higher conductivity      Mechanical Performance      A further 100 metres of prepreg from examples 3, 12 and 15 were produced. Mechanical properties were compared to identical laminates formed without any conductive particles. A cured ply thickness of 0.25 mm was assumed for the 268 gsni fibre areal weight fibres.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000045_0001"" />    Table 10 it can be seen that the presence of the electrically conductive carbon particles has little or no effect on mechanical performance whereas the use of the planar particle of Example 15 reduced the impact strength.      Examples 19 to 24      Prepregs were prepared using layers of fabric having an areal weight of 268 g/m<2> on a semi commercial prepreg line.

REFERENCE TO GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT      [0002] (none)      REFERENCE TO MICROFICHE APPENDIX      [0003] (none)      FIELD OF THE INVENTION      [0004] The present invention relates to monitoring of living subjects, such as during exercise, and more particularly to exercise monitoring of persons where measured or input exercise data is communicated by a mobile communications device to and from the internet.   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION      [0005] Several attempts have been made in the past to achieve efficient interactive communication of medical or health information between a subject or patient and a reviewer or provider of that information. However, in general, previous systems have limited the user to the general location in which the device was located. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,047, images and data were transmitted by standard telephone lines or wireless telemetry systems.      [0006] Even where devices are portable, as in the case of a laptop computer with a modem, an ordinary POTS phone line must be found and used. Where the user's computer employs a broadband connection, such as DSL or satellite, the choices of location are even more limited.      [0007] Attempts have been made to remedy this deficiency. As noted above, some telemetry systems allow a ""wireless"" distance to be placed between a health measuring unit and a remote monitoring system. However, such systems are limited in their range.      [0008] Other systems have used cellular telephone technology to increase the wireless health monitoring range. However, these systems have several deficiencies, such as requiring significant modification of the mobile phone. For example, U.S. Pat. No.      5,772,586, issued Jun. 30, 1998 to Heinonon et al, discloses a method for monitoring the health of a patient. This system uses a specialized connection between the patient health measuring unit and the cellular phone, however. The patient health measuring unit is located in the battery space of the mobile phone and is connected to a communication bus of the mobile phone. Other systems have been proposed, but these suffer from similar deficiencies in that they require specially modified cellular phones to be employed.      [0009] The deployment of the above systems also currently lacks employment of full back-end server functionality with which to provide a wide range of interactive communication with the patient. Instead, such systems, if internet-enabled, are often limited to mere one-way non-interactive data transfer via a modem.   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION      [0010] Embodiments of the present invention overcome one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a full-feature health and exercise monitoring system that may wirelessly connect to a back-end server application via the internet. The invention allows wireless access to and from a wide variety of present exercise or health-related instruments and devices, while maintaining the capability of connecting to future such devices.      [0011] The advent of multimedia mobile phones and other personal communications devices that include a digital camera, or are able to connect with one, allows the capture and transmission of health and exercise information, including images. In embodiments of the present invention, multimedia mobile phones are used to transmit voice and images as well as data from an exercise monitoring device. In addition to the uploading of images, the display screen of a wireless internet device (""WID""), such as a smart phone, is used to allow the display of images such as illustrations, diagrams or video clips which may be downloaded from a server as part of an interactive user interface (e.g., for the purpose of describing to a user how to set up an exercise regime). The ability to include images in a system that is based on a WID connected to a exercise monitoring device helps facilitate the remote analysis and monitoring of exercise, fitness, nutrition, or health.      [0012] The reviewer or provider of exercise or health information is understood to include not only the user but also a trainer, coach, specialist, caregiver, physician, another user, or a software application or algorithm that may analyze the information. The information can include data from a variety of monitoring devices and images relating to the condition of the user. The images could include photographs or videos of the user's specific situation that could aid their exercise regime.      [0013] In particular, the invention may be embodied in several systems. Two      complementary such systems are described herein, although extensions to other such systems can be envisioned. In the first embodiment, a health or lifestyle management plan may be implemented. Various exercise parameters, such as those relating to fitness, nutrition or exercise, may be received from an exercise monitoring device, and the same   may be wirelessly communicated to a server. The exercise parameters may include physiological data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, or temperature; or data corresponding to the amount of exercise performed, such as number of miles traveled, how much work performed, or the like. In some cases, derived data, such as number of calories burned, may also be measured by an appropriate calculation. An application may process, store, and perform calculations on the exercise parameters, these may be reported back to the user, and a health, nutrition, or fitness specialist or other reviewer may optionally review the same or different derived or measured values. The second embodiment of the invention may be employed to manage the disease state or condition of a patient. In this embodiment, the patient, or a caregiver, may employ a health monitoring device (""HMD""), in particular a medical device, and a wireless connection to provide data from the medical device for processing via the internet, including a review by a physician or other health care professional if required.      [0014] In other embodiments, the condition of subjects may be evaluated by collecting exercise, health, or medical data and providing information in response to those data by means of a WID designed to display interactive information through a connection to the Internet. The present invention may be connected to various HMDs, and may      communicate information via a wireless connection such as a wireless Internet connection. The user of the present invention may be the subject, or another person such as a trainer, coach, or physician. Wireless internet connectivity has many advantages. For example, in the first embodiment, a person interested in tracking an exercise program may take the WID to the local health club and attach the same to an exercise machine, send data output from various exercise machines over the Internet, which may include data relating to how much exercise or work was performed, and physiological data such as heart rate, and receive a personalized response from an application program running on a server. The individual may input caloric content of foods eaten, and may further input caloric content of exercise performed. In this way, e.g., a person in a weight-loss program may see in great detail whether they are expending more calories in the form of exercise than the same individual is consuming in the form of food. Alternatively, in the second embodiment, a diabetic could connect a blood glucose meter to a WID away from home   and download data to a Diabetes Management Company's server and, in response, receive guidance displayed on the screen (or by voice) about choices for the next meal.      [0015] In general, in the health management embodiment, the system may be employed to monitor the physiological status of a healthy subject while exercising, or performing other activities by receiving data from a variety of exercise monitors that provide physiological data and/or data corresponding to the amount of exercise or work performed. Exercise monitors that provide physiological data may include heart rate monitors, respiration rate monitors, blood pressure monitors, accelerometers, pedometers, body weight scales, body fat gauges, biofeedback devices, physiotherapy or chiropractic equipment, or the like, and the same may be separate devices or devices incorporated within an exercise machine. Exercise machines may include, e.g., treadmills, rowing machines, steppers, other aerobic or anaerobic exercise equipment, weight machines, or any other type of exercise machine. Exercise data corresponding to an amount of exercise performed may be measured by such machines and sent to the WID as described. For clarity, such devices are termed herein ""exercise monitors"" or ""exercise monitoring devices"" and the same measure ""exercise parameters"" or ""exercise data"". Exercise parameters or data may include the above physiological data and/or data corresponding to an amount of exercise or work performed.      [0016] In more detail, embodiments of the present invention provide a method and system for assisting subjects to maintain a healthy lifestyle by collecting and transmitting exercise data and in turn receiving information in response to those data by means of a WID designed to display interactive information through a connection to the Internet. The present invention may be connected to various HMDs, both medical and exercise-related in nature, and may communicate information via a wireless connection such as a wireless Internet connection.      [0017] A major advantage of embodiments of the invention is that the same frees the patient from the constraints of wired systems. The same allows users with consumer ""off- the-shelf wireless devices, e.g. mobile phone, to significantly extend the range of connectivity over that of wired computers, or even wireless telemetry systems.   [0018] The WID may be a web-enabled mobile phone. Alternatively, the WID may be a PDA, palm, handheld, tablet, netbook, or laptop computer, equipped with a wireless modem. Besides these, the WID may be a hybrid device that combines the functions of a computer, PDA and telephone in some fashion. It should also be noted that the WID may be a web-enabled mobile phone or hybrid device using a satellite communications network.      [0019] In a separate embodiment, an adaptor is used if necessary to convert the output signal of the exercise monitoring device to a suitable input signal for the, e.g., WID. The adaptor allows connection of the WID to an exercise monitor, either separately or one that forms part of an exercise machine or other variety of health care equipment, and the connection may be made via several techniques.      [0020] As for wired techniques, a standard parallel bus, universal serial bus (USB), Firewire, serial cable, or similar industry-standard connection may be used if the input/output ports between the HMD and the WID are appropriate. Otherwise, a suitable separate adaptor may be employed.      [0021] The connection may also be an input such as a memory device reader, a disk drive or other media input for input of data, a USB port or phone jack or other such wired input, again employing an adaptor if required.      [0022] As for wireless techniques, infrared (IR), microwaves, radio frequency (RF), a variety of cellular protocols, a variety of 802.11 protocols, 802.15 protocols, 802.16 protocols, 802.20 protocols, other IEEE 802 family protocols, short range wireless transmission, wide area network or broadband transmission methods, such as      Bluetooth, wireless universal serial bus protocols (W-USB), WiFi, WiMax, WiFiMax, Long Term Evolution (LTE), ultrawideband protocols (UWB), Voice over IP (VOIP), or satellite communication protocols or other wireless protocols, or optical techniques including lasers, may be employed. As above, an adapter is used if necessary to convert the output of an exercise device to a suitable wireless signal for the WID, for example, a Bluetooth virtual serial cable.   [0023] The user, or other person such as a trainer, may also input data manually, such as by a stylus, keypad, touch screen, synchronization from a PC, or by various other techniques discussed below. Such a capability may be especially useful for the input of food data, e.g., caloric content consumed, or the like.      [0024] A major advantage of the invention is that by use of an optional adaptor, the system is compatible with current and prior HMDs as well as maintaining a capability of adapting to future such systems.      [0025] A digital camera may be integral to the WID to provide photographic or video images to supplement the data from the HMD. Alternatively, the WID may be connected to a camera either through a wired or wireless connection. The HMD may also provide image data (e.g., exercise machine on-screen signals could be transmitted visually if an output connection is not available).      [0026] The interaction between a WID and a back-end server may provide a major additional advantage in certain embodiments of the invention. In particular, the relatively small amount of memory currently provided on a WID as compared to a back-end server limits the functionality of applications running on the WID, especially in terms of computing capacity, processing power, and user interface. By providing significant application functionality on the back-end, less memory and processing capabilities become necessary on the WID (i.e., on the ""front-end""). Thus, memory may be used in the WID for an enhanced user interface or for other purposes, according to the user requirements. The invention is protocol-independent.      [0027] In a method according to an embodiment of the invention, the user connects to a specific Internet site and a software program, resident on a computer readable medium such as a hard disk drive, flash memory, permanent disk storage such as a DVD-ROM, firmware, or the like, on a remote server located on the Internet, downloads an interactive user interface for that patient or subject user and an application for the measurement of the exercise information or that allows, enables, controls, or otherwise provides for the transfer of information from the exercise monitor to the WID. Alternatively, the software may have been previously installed on the WID by a supplier or a from a memory device,   or downloaded to a computer readable medium of the WID such as an internal memory storage, or in another manner as is known in the art, from a personal computer or wireless access point or via other wireless download technologies via a synchronization operation in known fashion.      [0028] The software provides a personalized display for the user and configures the WID to control and monitor devices connected via a generic input/output port to the WID. The software may be designed to suit the constraints of the small display screens of WIDs. The software, as well as inputs from the user or other inputs, can control the manner, content, and display of information presented to the user, and measured or input data can be stored for review by the user, a trainer, coach, health care professional, other user, or be processed further by a software algorithm or application. The algorithm may be of varying complexity, from a simple program that merely provides a response to the user, to an artificial intelligence algorithm, such as an expert system, collaborative filtering system, rules-based system, case-based reasoning system, or other such artificial intelligence application.      [0029] Further information may be provided to or from the user, including information entered manually, e.g., calories consumed or exercise performed. The user may input this information directly on the WID or via a personal computer, which then may download the input information to the WID via a synchronization operation using standard protocols, such as those for smart phone devices.      [0030] The user may also input supplemental information via a PC connected independently to the server via the internet. Alternatively, the user may input this information via connection with another device using standard protocols, wired or wireless connections including a variety of 8021.1 1 protocols, a variety of 8021.15 protocols, a variety of 802.16 protocols or wireless transmission methods such as Bluetooth, WiFi, WiMax, WiFiMax, or infrared wireless connections. In addition, a Global Positioning System (GPS) device can be used to provide data about the location of the user. The GPS information can be used to calculate an exercise parameter corresponding to the amount of exercise performed, e.g., by tracking the distance travelled.   [0031] The use of a WID equipped with a ""hands-free"" earpiece and microphone allows the user to interact with the trainer, coach, or health care professional while recording exercise data. The use of a camera-equipped mobile phone further allows the trainer or health care professional to instruct the user to send photographs or video to assist in the exercise performance or analysis. The deployment of voice processing technology may be used to allow an even more convenient user interface.      In all of these respects, the portable aspect of the WID is important: to wit, the user may conveniently carry the WID on their person wherever they go, allowing data entry at the time needed or as is convenient. A wearable WID such as implemented by a smart watch, eyewear, article of clothing, or other device or configured to be worn by a person, makes it even more convenient for a user to carry the WID on their person.      [0032] A, trainer, coach, or other person reviewing the data may also input supplemental information via a PC connected independently to the server via the internet to supplement the data input to the WID.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS      [0042] Various acronyms are used for clarity herein. Definitions are given below.      The term ""HMD"" may encompass not only devices with physiological and exercise data sensors but also devices with a keypad, keyboard, mouse, touch screen, pointer, pressure sensor, or other such inputs that the patient or user may employ to perform data entry of the desired parameters. In general, HMDs include some means for determining an exercise or health parameter. For receiving physiological data, an HMD may be a heart rate monitor, a blood pressure monitor, an ambulatory ECG recorder, a respiratory monitor, a temperature monitor and so on.      [0043] For receiving exercise data corresponding to the amount of exercise performed, an HMD may be an exercise monitor such as a pedometer, accelerometer, biofeedback device, or other sensor tracking duration, rate, intensity or total amount of exercise, such as number of miles traveled. In a healthy lifestyle management embodiment, an HMD may be incorporated within an exercise machine, including treadmills, rowers, steppers, exercise cycles, or other aerobic or anaerobic exercisers, the same providing exercise data corresponding to the amount of exercise performed such as number of miles traveled,   duration of exercise or rate of work performed, and the same may provide physiological data such as heart rate, and additional derived data such as the number of calories.      [0044] The term ""subject"" as used herein primarily indicates a human subject. The same may be, a person interested in maintaining health via accurate recording of exercise, fitness, and nutrition, and so on, or a medical patient under a physician's care or the care of another healthcare professional The term ""user"" is generally used to refer to a user of the WID, which may be synonymous with the subject or may alternatively be another person using a similar WID to review the data from the first user. A user may also be a trainer, fitness coach, physician monitoring an exercise program, or the like. The term ""patient"" is used, in addition to a person under the care of a physician, to also refer to a ""normal"" or healthy individual who is interested in maintaining a healthy physiological balance.      [0045] The term ""signal communication"" is used to mean any type of connection between components where the connection is, e.g., electromagnetic, and where the connection allows information to be passed from one component to another. This term may be used in a similar fashion as ""coupled"", ""connected"", ""information communication"", ""data communication"", etc. The following are examples of signal communication schemes. As for wired techniques, a standard USB or serial cable may be used if the input/output ports are compatible and an optional adaptor may be employed if they are not. As for wireless techniques, examples of employable techniques include: infrared (IR), microwaves, radio frequency (RF), a variety of cellular protocols, a variety of 802.1 1 protocols, 802.15 protocols, 802.16 protocols, 802.20 protocols, other IEEE 802 family protocols, short range wireless transmission, wide area network or broadband transmission methods, such as Bluetooth, wireless universal serial bus protocols (W-USB), WiFi, WiMax, WiFiMax, Long Term Evolution (LTE), VOIP, ultrawideband protocols (UWB), satellite communication protocols or other wireless protocols, or optical techniques including lasers. The user may also input data manually, such as by a stylus or keypad, touchpad or by various other techniques discussed above and below.      [0046] The term ""generic input/output port"" is used to mean any type of conventional, standard, universal, stock, consumer, or ""off-the-shelf port for data input and output.   These may include both wired and wireless ports and may be located externally or internally to the WID. A further description is given below.      [0047] Various embodiments of the invention are now described in more detail.      [0048] Referring to FIG. 1, a system is shown for monitoring exercise data from a patient or subject 38. The system includes a wireless exercise monitoring apparatus (""WEMA"") 10 described in further detail below. WEMA 10 is linked in a wireless fashion to a wireless connection point of presence (""POP"") 19, the same including at least a base station antenna 15 coupled to a server 17. Server 17 is in turn connected to the wired, or even a wireless (not shown) Internet 21, which may include the World Wide Web.      [0049] It should be noted that the base station embodiment shown in FIG. 1 may be replaced or removed for mobile phones which connect via satellite i.e., ""satellite phones"", rather than via a cellular network or other wireless communication.      [0050] Referring to FIG. 2, a first embodiment of WEMA 10 is shown. WEMA 10 includes an HMD 11 , which may include an optional monitor screen 40, coupled via an optional adaptor 42 to a WID 12. WID 12 connects wirelessly via an antenna 60 to base station 15 (see FIG. 1). One function of WID 12 may be to provide the user interface; other functions are described below.      [0051] As noted above, HMD 1 1 may include a physiological sensor 24 which connects to the HMD via a connection 44 (or which may alternatively connect directly to the WID) or a sensor 24' tracking an amount of exercise performed that connects to the WID (or HMD) via a connection 44'; or may include a manual system 36 for input of      physiological and exercise data via a connection 34. Manual system 36 may also be used to input data directly into WID 12 via a connection 32. Manual system 36 may include, e.g., a keyboard or keypad 30, a mouse 26, a pen-type device 28, touch screen 28' and may also employ a separate monitor (not shown). Of course, the user may also view information on monitor 40 or on a screen 41 of WID 12. In many embodiments, the touch screen or keypad system employed by many current mobile phones such as the iPhone, may be preferred for such manual data input.   [0052] Data may also be input via entry on a computer 37. This data may then be synchronized to WID 12 in known fashion. Alternatively, computer 37, or another computer may be used to connect to a server using the wired internet. This use may be particularly advantageous when entering a large amount of data. As noted above, in this way the user may be afforded a more convenient environment in which to manipulate data to supplement the data input to the WID.      [0053] It will be clear to one of skill in the art given this teaching that cable 32, as well as cables 34 and 44, may be replaced with wireless circuitry to communicate signals wirelessly. Alternatively, cables 34 or 44 may be replaced by a direct plug and socket connection. In this connection, adaptor 42 may be a direct plug and socket connection.      [0054] For exercise devices and applications, physiological sensor 24 may include, e.g., a sensor appropriate for measuring heart rate, respiration, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen levels, blood pressure, electrocardiograms (ECG), or any other desired physiological parameter. Sensor 24 may also include a camera configured as a heart pulse monitor by detecting color or heat changes. Sensor 24 may connect via an optional cable 44 to subject 38. Alternatively, sensor 24 may be distal of HMD 11, i.e., at or within subject 38. In other words, if cable 44 is employed, sensor 24 may be proximal or distal of cable 44. In some applications, such as some types of cardiac monitoring, sensor 24 is implanted within the patient. The sensor 24' tracking the exercise performed may include, e.g. a pedometer, accelerometer, biofeedback device, timer, GPS device, or other sensor tracking duration, rate, intensity or total amount of exercise. Either or both the physiological sensor and/or sensor tracking the amount of exercise may be incorporated in exercise machines such as a treadmill, exercise bicycle, stepper and so forth.      Alternatively, other exercise monitors may also be employed so long as the measured data may either be transferred to WID 12, e.g., via optional adaptor 42, described in further detail below, or by being read by a user, e.g., from a display, and manually input to the WID.      [0055] If a wireless communications capability is added, sensor 24 or sensor 24' need not physically connect with HMD 11 or WID 12 at all. That is, the same may measure an exercise parameter and may communicate the same to WEMA 10 wirelessly. The short-   range wireless communications schemes which may be employed include infrared, radio frequency including a variety of 802.15 protocols such as Bluetooth, a variety of 802.11 protocols such as WiFi or any other such wireless transmission schemes, including those described above.      [0056] As examples of sensor types, to measure heart rate, sensor 24 may be placed via a chest band or an adhesive sensor disposed on the chest. As an example of sensor type 24' to measure the amount of exercise performed, a pedometer may be disposed on the user to track the number of miles travelled. Other exercise monitors may also be employed so long as the measured data may either be transferred to WID 12, e.g., via optional adaptor 42, described in further detail below, or by being read by a user, e.g., from a display, and manually input to WID 12. Alternatively, the measured data may be transferred to WID 12 via wireless communication schemes, using a variety of 802.15 protocols such as Bluetooth, a variety of 802.1 1 protocols such as WiFi, infrared, optical, microwaves, etc., directly from sensor 24 or sensor 24' or from HMD 1 1 as described in greater detail below. HMD 1 1 may be a wearable device, such as a watch in wireless communication with sensor 24, e.g. a heart rate chest band; or sensor 24 can be integrated with the watch, e.g. a resident pulse monitor. Sensor 24 may also be integrated in an article of clothing, e.g. smart apparel. The wearable device may communicate wirelessly with WID 12, e.g. a mobile phone, or with the Internet 11 directly via other transceiver means.      [0057] . The user, who may or may not be the same person as subject 38, may input data to WID 12 to supplement the measured data. For example, in a health or exercise system, if subject 38 consumes a known number of calories, this information may be entered via manual system 36 directly into WID 12 or into HMD 1 1. Further, the user, the subject, and the sensor are not necessarily the sole sources of information. Data stored on the server, or on a separate server operated for health management, may also be employed to result in a health benefit to subject 38.      [0058] The data used to benefit the subject 38 may be from a camera as well as from an HMD. Referring to FIG. 3, an embodiment of a WID 244 is shown equipped with a camera 224 and an optional memory device 246. The camera may be integral to the WID,   or may be separate and connected via a cable. The camera may be incorporated in a wearable WID, e.g smart      [0059] Particularly important types of visual data about a user that may be wirelessly transmitted from the WID are those corresponding to photographic pictures, both still and video, and graphical or visual data output images from an HMD, e.g., an exercise machine. In either case, a trainer, coach, or medical personnel may use such data to take appropriate action.      [0060] To obtain the first type of data noted above, photographic data, a camera may be employed, which is either resident on the WID or is otherwise available by way of a wired or wireless link. The WID may store photographic data, either still or video, and transmit the same wirelessly to a point of collection, e.g., a server application, or may save the photographic data on the memory device or in other device storage for contemporaneous or later transmission, again either via a streamed, non-streamed, or other transmission method. The WID may be in the form of a wearable device equipped with a camera, e.g. eyewear or watch. As noted above, the WID may connect with a physiological sensor 24, e.g. a distal or integrated pulse monitor, and with a sensor 24' to measure the amount of exercise performed, e.g. a distal or integrated GPS device.      [0061] There are various ways in which visual data may be communicated to a remote reviewer. A simple method is to send the visual data via an email message. In more advanced methods, the visual data may be integrated with a data stream of other medical information. Current systems may be used in combination with the present invention to facilitate the handling and transmission of visual data by a WID. In all cases, the visual data may be stored, e.g., as a separate file or may be included as an embedded object in a data file on the memory device or in an email.      [0062] In more detail, a data port from a HMD that is coupled to a user may be employed to send visual information from the same to an input port on the WID. This transmission may be accomplished via the techniques described above. Such data may be in either a raw form or in a preformatted-for-video form, and may be stored in the WID or on the memory device. In either case, it may be required to format the data in a way suitable for   the display screen of the WID. In some cases, viewing on the WID is not necessary, and the data may be sent in its original form, optionally undergoing some intermediate processing, directly on to the trainer, coach or other remote reviewer's system for viewing or analysis. Examples of this type of data may pertain to the performance of exercise data or other sources of data. The remoter reviewer may include another user, similarly equipped with a WID, e.g. when the users are engaged in team activities.      [0063] Alternatively, a subset of the data may be sent, such as a compressed version, while the remainder, i.e., the complete version of the user data, may be maintained on the WID and/or memory device for purposes of maintaining a complete user record.      [0064] The memory device 246 may be a smartcard, a smartmedia card, a memory card, memory stick, compact flash card, memory cubes, micro-drives, disk-on-keys, flash memory-keys, micro-laser disks, nano-storage devices, bio-memories, battery/memory combination device, USB flash drives, and so on, or indeed any other type of removable media that may be connected to a WID to store information. Typically, these memory devices are capable of storing substantial amounts of data. The same may also include a memory and power source or combination device. In another embodiment, the memory device 246 may be inserted (not shown) in a memory device reader, which is in turn connected to a WID via a link.      [0065] Of course, in some devices, including some current smart mobile phones or other wireless mobile devices such as netbooks, there is no need for a separate memory device 246 as the internal storage capacity, e.g. in the form of solid state memory, microdrive or other memory storage devices, is sufficient to store all applications and data. Whether via a memory device 246 or internal storage, enhanced functionality and storage are provided for the WIDs 244 or 250. This may be particularly important for exercise data, as certain physiological monitoring apparatuses produce copious amounts of data, e.g., cardiac monitoring equipment, and thus require substantial storage capabilities. This is particularly true for memory-intensive video and multimedia content.      [0066] Another reason such memory devices are particularly pertinent in medical device monitoring is that they store data which can then be wirelessly transmitted in a streamed   or non-streamed fashion. In the event of drop-outs, interruptions, or unavailability of the wireless network, no loss of data occurs, as the data has been stored on the memory device and may be wirelessly transmitted at a later time when cellular or mobile service is again available. The memory device thus serves as a backup storage media. In the event of an extended period of unavailability of a wireless network, the memory device may be replaced or overwritten to provide practically unlimited storage until such time as the network is available and the data can be uploaded. In more detail, in the case of a dropout or other disruption of wireless service, the data may be stored on the memory device or in the WID if it has not already been, as may be the case for streamed data. The WID may periodically test for the availability of the wireless network, and may wait until the network is available. Once the system is again available, the advice from the trainer, coach or other reviewer may be sent to the WID and the user may again take action.      [0067] Of course, even if the wireless network is available, the memory device or onboard WID memory may store the data for various purposes. This real-time capability and robustness is often very important in ensuring user safety and ensuring that a high level of care is being delivered to the user by the trainer, coach, or medical personnel, particularly in field situations, such as running or, bicycling, where the wireless connection may be the only source of communication. A related reason why memory devices are particularly pertinent in exercise device monitoring is that they allow a greater level of buffering for real-time data monitoring, thus allowing more pre-analysis and filtering of data.      [0068] A further benefit of the use of memory devices is that they provide for easy application downloading onto a WID. For example, a memory device may be inserted into a WID and a large application program may be easily downloaded onto the computer-readable media of a WID from the memory device rather than through a wired or wireless synchronization or downloading process via a PC or the internet or both. Appropriate types of computer-readable media have been described above. Downloading in this fashion may be particularly rapid and complete. The downloaded data may include visual data, such as still or video photographic images, that instruct a user on the operation of a device. In an alternative embodiment, visual data need not be downloaded but may rather be streamed, either from a stored video on a server or in real-time via a user with a webcam. In downloaded or streamed but generally not live systems, the user   interface may be interactive, allowing the user to access a knowledge database resident on the server or memory device or previously downloaded onto the memory of the WID.      [0069] Referring to FIG. 4, WEMA 10 is shown communicating wirelessly with the Internet. In doing so, WEMA 10 generally sends a wireless signal to a base station 14 (in known fashion) that is connected to a server 18 that is in signal communication (in known fashion) with the internet 20. Server 18 communicates via a protocol (in known fashion) to Internet 20, which also communicates via a protocol (in known fashion) to a server 22 running an application 62. Server 22 may be accessed (in known fashion) by a client computer 44 through a connection 64.      [0070] As noted, the protocols for data communication are known. They include a variety of cellular protocols, a variety of 802.1 1 protocols, 802.15 protocols, 802.16 protocols, 802.20 protocols, other IEEE 802 family protocols, wide area network or broadband transmission methods, WiFi, WiMax, WiFiMax, Long Term Evolution (LTE), VOIP, ultrawideband protocols (UWB), or other wireless communication protocols, and may include a satellite instead of ground-based communication systems. However, they currently vary amongst known techniques. The present invention is not limited to any particular protocols, and may be implemented in any languages supported by the WID and server. In particular, the wireless communications schemes envisioned by the present invention include cellular, mobile, satellite, and other such wireless techniques. In such wireless communication systems, an additional security layer may be employed, including industry-standard encryption and decryption of the transmitted data, especially as health information is highly sensitive and private data.      [0071] Of course, as computing capabilities continue to increase, it is expected that the capabilities of WEMA 10, servers 18 and 22, as well as application 62 and client 44, and other components, will correspondingly increase.      [0072] Application 62 running on server 22 which is stored in computer readable media as described above may interact with WEMA 10 in a number of ways. Referring to FIG. 5, WEMA 10 is shown in signal communication with server 22 via a connection 72. Connection 72 schematically represents the wireless Internet connection and intervening   pathways. WEMA 10 includes an application that may be viewed as having two components: a base wireless or device application 70 and an application presentation layer or user interface 68. User interface 68 is employed to, e.g., present a menu of options to the user, to allow the user to choose inputs, and to generally operate the device. User interface 68 may vary widely in sophistication, e.g., from a simple data entry field to a full graphical user interface. These applications may accept as inputs data from a sensor 24 and sensor 24' as well as from a manual input 36.      [0073] Server 22 has a base server application 62 stored on computer-readable media as described above with which the same calculates or provides a response based at least in part on data from WEMA 10. Application 62 may include an algorithm 63 for analyzing data from the HMD, and either application 62 or algorithm 63 may optionally access data from an external data source 74 and may further consult an artificial intelligence system 76. Server 22 may be accessed by a remote computing device 37' by the subject user, a trainer, coach, or any other reviewer.      [0074] External data source 74 may be a memory or disk or other such storage that stores health data, such as healthy and unhealthy weight/height ranges, healthy and unhealthy cholesterol counts, the user's prior medical or health history, healthy and unhealthy heart rate values, information corresponding to the caloric and other nutritional content of foods, information corresponding to the caloric expenditure values of various exercises, algorithms for calculating various health parameters, etc. In general, any data that may benefit the health of a user may be stored in external data source 74. External data source 74 may be a memory device or other such storage that stores supplemental data such as treatment protocols. In general, any data that may benefit or otherwise affects the health condition of a user may be stored in external data source 74. External data source 74 may also include online access of health information from external databases or other sources.      [0075] As noted, application 62 or algorithm 63 may also consult AI system 76 for suggestions as to health benefits. AI system 76 may even interact with external data source 74 to extract useful information from the same. AI system 76 may employ, e.g., case-based reasoning, rules-based systems, collaborative filtering, neural networks, expert systems, or other such systems as are known.   [0076] It should also be noted that each of application 62, algorithm 63, external data source 74, or AI system 76, may physically reside on more than one server, e.g., on an array of servers for, e.g., storage or multiple processing purposes. Each of application 62, algorithm 63, external data source 74, or AI system 76, or combinations of each, may also respectively reside on different servers.      [0077] The extent to which server application 62 interacts with wireless application 70 depends on the use to which the system is put. For example, in a less interactive embodiment, device application 70 may act to measure a user's heart rate during exercise and report the same to server application 62. In this case, a trainer may simply review the measured value and send the user a response reporting that the value is acceptable or not. In a highly interactive embodiment, a user may have numerous HMDs 1 1 measuring a variety of physiological data and/or other data tracking the amount of exercise performed, connected via optional adaptors to a WID 12, and wireless application 70 may correspondingly send a large amount of exercise data to server application 62. The trainer, coach, or physician accessing server application 62, may in turn send detailed plans for an exercise regimen via connection 72. The received data may be analyzed using algorithm 63, external data source 74, and AI system 76. In this sense, the two applications may be highly interactive.      [0078] It is noted that an Application Service Provider (ASP) may operate application 62. That is, application 62 may be leased by an ASP to a company specializing in fitness or lifestyle management, and the ASP may perform all necessary upgrades and maintenance to application 62 and its associated components.      [0079] To initialize the system, the program starts and a wireless application is loaded into computer readable media in the WID, if it has not been pre-loaded. The initial loading of the wireless application may occur via synchronization from a desktop or via downloading from a server over the internet. The server application may be loaded into computer readable media in an appropriate internet-connected server. Subject data may be loaded into the WID or into the server application. In the latter case, the subject information may later be transferred to the WID. The initialization scheme then ends.   [0080] The wireless application may access the server and server application, or vice- versa, as determined by the respective program instructions.      [0081] Referring to FIG. 6, a flowchart of a method is shown for a system of exercise, fitness, nutrition or health monitoring, and/or exercise management. In this example, the HMD is in the form of a general exercise machine such as a treadmill, stepper, exercise bicycle and so forth. An exercise monitor may be integral to the exercise machine or may be separate.      [0082] In the method, both exercise data and visual data may be wirelessly transmitted from the WID. Visual data include that corresponding to photographic pictures, both still and video, and graphical or visual data output images from an HMD, e.g., an exercise machine or equipment display screen, or other images related to the exercise being performed. A trainer or coach may review these images and use them to guide the user as appropriate as described below.      [0083] After the start (step 242) of the method, a user interacts with a WID (step 240). By the interaction, visual data may be captured (step 241 '), and/or the user may send supplemental data to the server and server application (step 241).      [0084] To obtain the visual data noted above, photographic data, a camera may be employed, which is either resident on the WID (camera 224 of FIG. 3) or is otherwise available by way of a link. The WID may store photographic data, either still or video, and transmit the same wirelessly to a point of collection, e.g., a server application, or may save the photographic data on the memory device for contemporaneous or later transmission, again either via a streamed, non-streamed, or other transmission method (step 208 of FIG. 6).      [0085] Also after the program is started (step 242), a sensor measures an exercise parameter (step 216), where the exercise parameter corresponds to physiological data or to data corresponding to the amount of exercise performed.   [0086] The exercise monitor sensor may send the parameter to the exercise machine (step 218) or the parameter may be sent directly to the WID (step 218'). It is understood here that the ""sensor"" may pertain to any of the exercise monitors discussed above.      [0087] If the parameter is sent to the exercise machine as an intermediate step, the exercise machine then sends the parameter to the WID (step 220). In any case, the WID wirelessly communicates the parameter to the application server (step 222), e.g., via the wireless web.      [0088] An alternative and complementary way of entering the parameter is by user input. For example, the user may enter the parameter into the exercise machine or into the WID. This parameter may correspond to an amount of exercise performed, an amount of food consumed, etc. Such data and other types are termed supplemental data, and may be transmitted to the server and server application (step 241). Calculations by the server application may take into account the supplemental data as well as the visual data and exercise data.      [0089] The server application processes the parameter (step 224 and optionally step 225), and calculates a response (step 226) based at least in part on the parameter. The server application may optionally employ external data (step 232) or an AI system (step 234) in the calculation. The application server then sends the response to the WID (step 228), where the response is displayed (step 230). Alternatively, the application server may sends the response to an alternate WID (step 228'), such as that of a coach or teammate, where the response is displayed (step 230').      [0090] The same definitional statements regarding the terms ""response"", ""calculate"", ""sensor"", etc., as given before, apply in this embodiment as well.      [0091] As an optional step, a trainer, coach, or other specialist may notify the user of the response (step 238) after having the same displayed on their client computer (step 236). The specialist may be replaced in this example by an application that may also include an algorithm.   [0092] To devise the exercise data mentioned above, a data port from a HMD that is coupled to a user may be employed to send information from the same to an input port on the WID. This transmission may be accomplished via the techniques described above. Such data may be in either a raw form or in a preformatted-for-video form, and may be stored in the WID or on the memory device. In either case, it may be required to format the data in a way suitable for the display screen of the WID. In some cases, viewing on the WID is not necessary, and the data may be sent in its original form, optionally undergoing some intermediate processing, directly on to the remote reviewer's system for viewing or analysis. Examples of this type of data may be the display output of an exercise machine or other sources of data. Alternatively, a subset of the data may be sent, such as a compressed version, while the remainder, i.e., the complete version of the user's data, may be maintained on the WID and/or memory device for purposes of maintaining a complete user record.      [0093] The WID may store the HMD data, and transmit the same wirelessly to a point of collection or may save the data on the memory device for contemporaneous or later transmission, again either via a streamed or other transmission method. The memory device may be any type of computer-readable media, including, e.g., a smartcard, a smartmedia card, a memory card, memory stick, compact flash card, memory cubes, micro-drives, disk-on-keys, flash memory-keys, micro-laser disks, nano-storage devices, bio-memories, battery/memory combination device, USB flash drives, and so on, or indeed any other type of removable media that may be connected to a WID to store information.      [0094] In the case of a dropout or other disruption of wireless service, the data may be stored on the memory device or in the WID if it has not already been, as may be the case for streamed data. The WID may periodically test for the availability of the wireless network, and may wait until the network is available. Once the system is again available, the advice from the caregiver may be sent to the WID and the on-site personnel may again take action.   [0095] Using such data, an off-site trainer, coach, or other health care professional may give the user valuable guidance and advice. Moreover, no wired or dedicated connection is necessary.      [0096] More particularly, for visual data, there are various ways in which such data may be communicated to an off-site reviewer. A simple method is to send the visual data via an email message. In more advanced methods, the visual data may be integrated with a data stream of other information. Current systems may be used in combination with the present invention to facilitate the handling and transmission of visual data by a WID. In all cases, the visual data may be stored, e.g., as a separate file or may be included as an embedded object in a data file on the memory device or in an email.      Adaptor Hardware      [0097] A description is given below of a particular type of adaptor hardware. As noted above, the adaptor may optionally be used to connect a HMD to a WID.      [0098] In general, a connection is necessary between a HMD 1 1 and a WID. The nature of this connection may vary. For example, the connection may be wired or wireless. For wired systems, the connection may be direct or an adaptor may be employed, either on one or both ends of the direct wired connection, to adapt the signal appropriately. In the same way, for wireless systems, the connection may be direct, if both HMD and WID employ the same wireless protocol, or an adaptor may be involved to modify the signal of one or both devices. These connections, all of which are encompassed by the present invention, are discussed in more detail below.      [0100] Referring to FIG. 7, an embodiment of the connection is shown. In this figure, a hardware (or ""wired"") connection is shown, i.e., an adaptor 168, disposed between a HMD 160 and a WID 162. The HMD 160 may connect to an exercise machine via a connector 52 with optional adaptor 124. This connection may also be wireless as has been described. In most circumstances, it is assumed that the varieties of HMDs will vary more widely than the varieties of WIDs. Accordingly, HMD 160 will likely have one of a variety of types of connectors for input/output purposes, here shown as a connector 164. Connector 164 mates with a connector 172 of adaptor 168. At another point on adaptor   168 is a connector 172' for connecting to a generic input/output port 164' on WID 162. A cable 170 is disposed between the two connectors, cable 170 capable of including adaptor circuitry if desired.      [0101] Of course, the use and structure of adaptor 168, between HMD 160 and WID 162, depends on factors such as the prevalence of an industry standard for such      communications. In other words, if the output of HMD 160 is readily acceptable to WID 162, then the same may be directly connected or may be connected via a simple cable, the same basically extending from pin-to-pin. For example, a standard Universal Serial Bus (USB) or serial cable (RS232) may be used if the input/output ports between the HMD and the WID are compatible. Otherwise, a suitable adaptor circuit that provides for appropriate signal and pin conversion may be employed. For example, a standard USB- to-serial (RS232) cable or the like may be used as required. The connection may also be an input for data, e.g. a USB port or phone jack or other such wired input, or a media storage device, again employing an adaptor circuit if required.      [0102] Port 164 can be used to communicate with HMD 160 and connector 164 via a number of types of wired connections, including USB, or Firewire. In some cases, optional adaptor 168 may also be employed.      [0103] In other embodiments, such as for devices connected to proprietary connectors, a less standard and perhaps proprietary pin-out may be required.      [0104] Referring to FIG. 8, an embodiment of a wireless implementation of the WEMA 10 is shown. In FIG. 8, a wireless connection is shown between HMD 160 and WID 162. HMD 160 may have an integral wireless modulator/demodulator disposed within (not shown). More likely, however, is that HMD 160 has an adaptor 165 connectable thereto which performs these functions. WID 162 may have an integral wireless      modulator/demodulator (not shown), although an adaptor can also be used in this context.      [0105] While the device shown in FIG. 8 is described in the context of general wireless communications, various protocols may be employed. For radio frequency      communications, a variety of 802.11 protocols, 802.15 protocols, other IEEE 802 family protocols, short-range wireless transmission methods such as Bluetooth, wireless   universal serial bus protocols (W-USB), or other wireless transmission methods may be advantageously employed. Other techniques employing a similar configuration include those employing IR, microwaves, optical techniques including lasers, and so on.      [0106] It should be understood that the above is merely exemplary, and that the form of the adaptor may vary widely between HMDs and WIDs.      [0107] As noted above, besides the exercise data transmission from HMDs, other sorts of transmissions may also occur. For example, visual data, such as photographs or videos, may be transferred as an indication of the user's performance condition and to aid remote analysis. Alternatively, other visual indications of a user's status, such as graphical or other outputs of HMDs, may provide information useful for a trainer, coach, or other reviewer.      [0108] In certain embodiments, a set of visual data from a camera or from an HMD and voice communication may be transmitted via the telecommunications infrastructure from the WID. The visual data may thus be sent via an appropriate protocol to a server for retrieval and analysis by a trainer, coach or other reviewer.      [0109] The advent of multimedia mobile phones and other WIDs that include a digital camera (or are equipped with a link to one) allow the capture and transmission of photographic images using low-cost consumer devices. Embodiments of the invention may employ these in combination with HMDs.      [0110] It will be understood that the above description of a ""Method And Apparatus For Exercise Monitoring Combining Exercise Monitoring and Visual Data With Wireless Internet Connectivity "" has been with respect to particular embodiments of the invention.

The method includes transmitting a plurality of paging channels using a plurality of distinct transmitting (TX) beams in a paging available interval by a paging transmitter (PT), each of the plurality of paging channels comprising same paging information; and transmitting a plurality of synchronization channels (SCHs) and/or broadcast channels (BCHs) using a plurality of distinct TX beams, each of the plurality of SCHs comprising a synchronization sequence, and each of the plurality of BCHs comprising system parameters, wherein the TX beams are transmitted in one or more time durations through one or more antenna arrays.","APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING/RECEIVING PAGING IN A BEAM FORMED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORK    The present disclosure relates to an apparatus and method for transmitting and receiving paging in a beam formed wireless communication network.     In the recent years, several broadband wireless technologies have been developed to meet the growing number of broadband subscribers and to provide more and better applications and services. The 3<rd>generation partnership project 2 (3GPP2) developed code division multiple access 2000 (CDMA 2000), 1x evolution data optimized (1x EVDO) and ultra mobile broadband (UMB) systems. The 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) developed wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), high speed packet access (HSPA) and long term evolution (LTE) systems. The institute of electrical and electronics engineers developed mobile worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) systems. As number of users of mobile communication is increasing along with number of services provided over these systems, there is a need of mobile communication with large capacity, high throughput, lower latency and better reliability.     super mobile broadband (SMB) system based on millimeter waves i.e. radio waves with wavelength in the range of 1millimeter (mm) to 10 mm, which corresponds to a radio frequency of 30 gigahertz (GHz) to 300 GHz, is a candidate for next generation mobile communication technology as vast amount of spectrum is available in mmWave band. An SMB network consists of multiple SMB base stations (BSs) that cover a geographic area. In order to ensure good coverage, SMB base stations need to be deployed with higher density than macro-cellular base stations. In general, roughly the same site-to-site distance as microcell or Pico-cell deployment in an urban environment is recommended. At higher frequency the propagation path losses are higher and hence the propagation distance is shorter. Beamforming techniques are used to decrease the high path loss and to increase the propagation distance for communication at higher frequency. Beamforming can be classified into transmission (TX) beamforming performed in a transmitting end and reception (RX) beamforming performed in a receiving end. In general, the TX beamforming increases directivity by narrowing an area in which the propagation is directed by using a plurality of antennas. In this situation, aggregation of the plurality of antennas can be referred to as an antenna array, and each antenna included in the array can be referred to as an array element.     The antenna array can be configured in various forms such as a linear array, a planar array, etc. The use of the TX beamforming results in the increase in the directivity of a signal, thereby increasing a propagation distance. Further, since the signal is almost not transmitted in a direction other than a directivity direction, a signal interference acting on another receiving end is significantly decreased. The receiving end can perform beamforming on a RX signal by using a RX antenna array. The RX beamforming increases RX signal strength in a specific direction by increasing the antenna gain in a specific direction, and excludes a signal transmitted in a direction other than the specific direction from the RX signal, thereby providing an effect of blocking an interference signal.     The frame structure for one such wireless communication using beamforming technique is illustrated in Figure 1. The BS transmits a synchronization signal through a synchronization channel (SCH) which assists MS to detect the presence of base station. The BS also transmits broadcast signal through a broadcast channel (BCH). The BCH carries essential system information which enables MS to have initial communication with the BS. The SCH and BCH are transmitted repetitively by performing beamforming on the channels with different transmission beams wherein each TX beam transmits the SCH and BCH in different direction. Because of hardware limitation of one antenna array at the BS (one antenna array is needed for one beam direction) the TX beams in different directions are transmitted at different times. The mobile station (MS) uses receive beamforming to detect the synchronization signal. The mobile station (MS) uses multiple RX beams to detect the SCH transmitted using multiple TX beams. Consider for example, SCH and BCH is transmitted using four TX beams and MS uses four RX beams to search the SCH and BCH. Four TX beams are transmitted in four different time durations (e.g., slots) in a sub frame on the high frequency carrier as illustrated in Figure 1.     In conventional wireless communication system, paging is transmitted to page mobile stations which are attached to the wireless communication network but are in idle mode. In the idle mode, MS wake ups at regular intervals for short periods to receive paging and other broadcast information. In beam formed wireless communication system, paging cannot be broadcasted.     Therefore, there is a need for Paging channel operation in a beam-formed system which is not disclosed in the state of the art. It needs to be defined such that MS wakeup time is minimized as much as possible.     The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the present disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the present disclosure.

A method and apparatus proposed in various embodiments of the present disclosure may be applied to any of various communication systems such as a long term evolution (LTE) system, an LTE-advanced (LTE-A) system, a high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) mobile communication system, a high speed uplink packet access (HSUPA) mobile communication system, a high rate packet data (HRPD) mobile communication system proposed in a 3rd generation project partnership 2 (3GPP2), a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) mobile communication system proposed in the 3GPP2, a code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile communication system proposed in the 3GPP2, an institute of electrical and electronics engineers (IEEE) mobile communication system, an evolved packet system (EPS), a mobile internet protocol (Mobile IP) system, and/or the like.     Figure 2 illustrates a schematic diagram depicting transmission and reception of paging information on a paging channel using N transmitting (TX) beams in paging available interval, according to one embodiment.     According to one embodiment of the paging channel transmission, the paging channel carrying paging information is transmitted using N transmitting (TX) beams in the paging available interval. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N different time durations if only one antenna array is available with paging transmitter (PT) for transmitting paging channel. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N/2 different time durations if two antenna arrays are available with paging transmitter (PT) for transmitting paging channel and so on. The paging channel transmission using N TX beams is not repeated for multiple receive (RX) beams in paging receiver (PR) which means that only one set of N TX beams is transmitted by paging transmitter (PT). In a beam-formed system paging receiver (PR) typically receives the transmission using multiple RX beams wherein the paging receiver (PR) uses one RX beam to receive one set of N TX beams and same is repeated for each RX beam.     The paging available interval can be of one frame duration wherein each frame comprises of multiple sub frames. Paging channel may be present in one or more SFs of paging available interval wherein the paging channel in different SFs carries different paging information (e.g. Different set of paging receivers (PR)may be assigned different SF for paging). In one method the sub frame zero (SF0) may not be used for paging channel. The number of paging channel TX beams in this embodiment of the disclosure is equal to the number of SCH/BCH beams. The order of transmission of TX beams for paging channel is same as order of SCH/BCH beams. Paging channel sub frame for paging may be fixed (pre-specified) i.e. paging channel for all paging receivers (PR) in a paging available interval is fixed. Alternately paging channel SF in paging available interval can be specific to paging receiver (PR). BCH may indicate if paging is there in PAI or not. BCH of PAI Frame and up to P frames before PAI should include paging indicator for paging in PAI Frame. The resources for paging channel transmissions in paging SF may be fixed or indicated by a control channel.     Figure 3illustrates a schematic diagram depicting a paging receiver wake up time for reception of paging information, according to one embodiment.     According to one embodiment of the Paging Channel Reception, paging receiver (PR) determines the wake up time before the paging available interval. The number of frames paging receiver (PR) wakes up early before the paging available interval depends on the location of paging channel in paging available interval, the location of SCH/BCH and the number of receive beams used by paging receiver to receive transmissions from paging transmitter(PT). As illustrated in Figure 3, the paging receiver uses two RX beams for receiving the transmissions from the paging transmitter (PT). If the paging is transmitted in SF0 of paging available interval then paging receiver wakes up at paging receiver wake up time 1 or paging receiver wake up time 2 depending on whether the paging is located before the SCH/BCH transmissions in SF0 or paging is located after the SCH/BCH transmissions in SF0. If the paging is located before the SCH/BCH transmissions in SF0 of frame F9 then paging receiver wakes up at paging receiver wake up time 1 (i.e. before the frame F7) and the RX beam for receiving the paging channel is the RX beam used to receive synchronization signal and BCH in F7 & F8. If the paging is located after the SCH/BCH transmissions in SF0 of frame F9 then paging receiver wakes up at paging receiver wake up time 2 (i.e. before the frame F8) and the RX beam for receiving the paging channel is the RX beam used to receive synchronization signal and BCH in F8 & F9. If the paging is located in any sub frames from SF1 to SF4 of frame F9 then paging receiver wakes up at paging receiver wake up time 2 (i.e. before the frame F8) and the RX beam for receiving the paging channel is the RX beam used to receive SCH/BCH in F8 & F9. Paging receiver wakes up at the determined wake up time and start searching for SCH/BCH. Paging receiver then performs the DL synchronization based on received SCH/BCH.     Figure 4 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver, according to one embodiment.Paging receiver (PR)determines the best TX beam wherein the best TX beam is the TX beam corresponding to SCH/BCH transmission which was successfully received by paging receiver. Paging receiver determines the best RX beam (Best RX beam amongst the multiple RX beams used by paging receiver to receive the transmissions from paging transmitter) wherein the best RX beam is the RX beam which was used by paging receiver to successfully receive the SCH/BCH transmission from paging transmitter. Paging receiver determines the paging channel to be received and decoded amongst the plurality of paging channel transmitted by the paging transmitter (plurality of paging channels are transmitted using multiple TX beams) wherein the Paging receiver (PR)determines this using the determined best TX beam. Paging receiver receives & decodes the determined paging channel in the paging available interval using the determined best RX beam amongst the plurality of RX beams supported by paging receiver. Note that Ifpaging receiver fails to decode the determined paging channel then it may decode other paging channel corresponding to other TX beams sequentially).In one exemplary embodiment, suppose beam 0 is the best TX beam determined by paging receiver based on reception of SCH/BCH transmissions. Paging receiver first decodes paging channel corresponding to beam 0 using best RX beam. If it fails to decode paging channel it decodes paging channel corresponding to beam 1 and so on. Alternatively, the paging receiver may decode all the TX beams corresponding to the paging channel using the best RX beam.     Figure 5 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver (PR), according to another embodiment.The paging receiver determines the best RX beam (Best RX beam amongst the multiple RX beams used by paging receiver to receive the transmissions from paging transmitter) wherein the best RX beam is the RX beam which was used by paging receiver to successfully receive the SCH/BCH transmission from paging transmitter (PT). Paging receiver receives & decodes the one or more paging channels in the paging available interval using the determined best RX beam amongst the plurality of RX beams supported by paging receiver (Note: paging receiver starts receiving from the first paging channel slot. If it fails to receive/decode the paging channel it receives paging channel in other paging channel slots sequentially). In this case paging receiver does not care about the best TX beam used to receive the SCHBCH transmissions.     Figure 6 illustrates a schematic diagram depicting transmission and reception of paging information on a paging channel using N transmitting (TX) beams and repeated P times in paging available interval, according to another embodiment.     According to one embodiment of the Paging Channel Transmission, the paging channel carrying paging information is transmitted using N transmitting (TX) beams and repeated P times in the paging available interval. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N different time durations if only one antenna array is available with paging transmitter (PT)for transmitting paging channel. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N/2 different time durations if two antenna arrays are available with paging transmitter (PT)for transmitting paging channel and so on. The number of repetition P is equal to number of RX beams which means that set of transmissions using N TX beams is repeated P times. The repetition of TX beams may be in same paging SF or in different paging SF. The number of repetition may be fixed for all paging receivers (PR) or it can be different for different paging receivers. There may be different group of paging receivers in network with different RX beamforming capability. Some may have two RX beams while others may have four RX beams. Based on paging receivers capability the network may group paging receivers in different groups and each group may be paged in different times with different repetition of TX beams. Paging receiver indicates its capability of RX beamforming to network when it attaches with network. This information can be used by the network to form paging receiver groups and apply different repetition for paging channel transmissions.     The paging available interval can be of one frame duration wherein each frame comprises of multiple sub frames. The number of paging channel TX beams in this embodiment of the present disclosure may or may not be equal to number of SCH/BCH beams. Paging channel sub frame for paging may be fixed or predefined i.e. paging channel for all paging receivers in a paging available interval is fixed. For example SF0 or SF1 or SF2 or SF3 or SF4 can be fixed for paging wherein the repetition is in same SF. Alternately two sub frames, (SF0,SF1) or (SF1,SF2) or (SF2,SF3) or (SF3,SF4) can be fixed for paging wherein the repetition is in different SF and two RX beams are used by paging receiver. Similarly other combinations are possible. Alternately paging channel SF in paging available interval can be specific to paging receiver. BCH may indicate if paging is there in PAI or not. BCH of PAI Frame and up to P frames before PAI should include paging indicator for paging in PAI Frame. The resources for paging channel transmissions in paging SF may be fixed or specified by a control channel.     According to one embodiment of the Paging Channel Reception, paging receiver determines the wake up time before the paging available interval. The number of frames paging receiver wakes up early before the paging available interval depends on the location of paging channel in paging available interval, the location of SCH/BCH and the number of receive beams used by paging receiver to receive the transmissions from paging transmitter(PT). As illustrated in Figure 6, the paging receiver uses two RX beams for receiving the transmissions from paging transmitter. If the paging is transmitted in SF0 of paging available interval then paging receiver wakes up at paging receiver (PR)wake up time 1 or paging receiver wake up time 2 depending on whether the paging is located before the SCH/BCH transmissions in SF0 or paging is located after the SCH/BCH transmissions in SF0. If the paging is located before the SCH/BCH transmissions in SF0 of frame F9 then paging receiver wakes up at paging receiver wake up time 1 (i.e. before the frame F7). If the paging is located after the SCH/BCH transmissions in SF0 of frame F9 then paging receiver wakes up at paging receiver wake up time 2 (i.e. before the frame F8). If the paging is located in any sub frames from SF1 to SF4 of frame F9 then UE wakes up at paging receiver wake up time 2 (i.e. before the frame F8). The paging receiver wakes up at the determined wake up time and start searching for SCH/BCH. The paging receiver then performs the DL synchronization using the received SCH/BCH.     Figure 7 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver, according to yet another embodiment.Paging receiver determines the best RX beam (Best RX beam amongst the multiple RX beams used by paging receiver (PR) to receive the transmissions from paging transmitter) wherein the best RX beam is the RX beam which was used by paging receiver to successfully receive the SCH/BCH transmission from paging transmitter (PT). Paging receiver then monitors the time duration where the first set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. The paging receiver receives the paging channel transmissions corresponding to N TX beams sequentially using determined best RX beam. If paging receiver fails to receive and decode the paging channel using the best RX beam in the time duration where the first set of paging channels are transmitted then paging receiver monitors the time duration where the next set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmission using RX beam other than the determined best RX beam. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmissions corresponding to N TX beams sequentially using the next RX beam.     Figure 8 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver (PR), according to another embodiment. The Paging receiver determines the best TX beam wherein the best TX beam is the TX beam corresponding to SCH/BCH transmission which was successfully received by paging receiver. paging receiver determines the best RX beam (Best RX beam amongst the multiple RX beams used by paging receiver to receive the transmissions from paging transmitter) wherein the best RX beam is the RX beam which was used by paging receiver to successfully receive the SCH/BCH transmission from paging transmitter(PT). Paging receiver then monitors the time duration where the first set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives/decodes the paging channel corresponding to best TX beam amongst the plurality of paging channel transmissions. In one method, if paging receiver fails to decode paging channel corresponding to best TX beam it receive/decode other paging channel transmissions corresponding to TX beam other than determined best TX beam. In another method, if paging receiver fails to decode paging channel corresponding to best TX beam it does not receive/decode other paging channel transmissions corresponding to TX beam other than determined best TX beam. If paging receiver(PR) fails to receive and decode the paging channel using the best RX beam in the time duration where the first set of paging channels are transmitted then paging receiver monitors the time duration where the next set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmission using RX beam other than the determined best RX beam. Paging receiver receives/decodes the paging channel corresponding to best TX beam amongst the plurality of paging channel transmissions. In one exemplary embodiment, if paging receiver fails to decode paging channel corresponding to best TX beam it receive/decode other paging channel transmissions corresponding to TX beam other than determined best TX beam. In another exemplary embodiment, if paging receiver fails to decode paging channel corresponding to best TX beam it does not receive/decode other paging channel transmissions corresponding to TX beam other than determined best TX beam.     Figure 9 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver, according to another embodiment. The paging receiver (PR) does not determine the best RX beam or best TX beam. Paging receiver monitors the time duration where the first set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmission using the first RX beam (any RX beam). If paging receiver fails to receive and decode the paging channel using the selected RX beam in the time duration where the first set of paging channels are transmitted then paging receiver monitors the time duration where the next set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmission using RX beam other than the RX beam already used.     Figure 10 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by a paging receiver (PR), according to another embodiment. The Paging receiver determines the best TX beam wherein the best TX beam is the TX beam corresponding to SCH/BCH transmission which was successfully received by paging receiver. Paging receiver monitors the time duration where the first set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmission using the first RX beam (any RX beam). Paging receiver receives/decodes the paging channel corresponding to best TX beam. In an exemplary embodiment, if paging receiver fails to decode paging channel corresponding to best TX beam it receive/decode other paging channel transmissions corresponding to TX beam other than determined best TX beam. In another exemplary embodiment, if paging receiver fails to decode paging channel corresponding to best TX beam it does not receive/decode other paging channel transmissions corresponding to TX beam other than determined best TX beam. If paging receiver fails to receive and decode the paging channel using the selected RX beam in the time duration where the first set of paging channels are transmitted then paging receiver monitors the time duration where the next set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted in the Paging Available Interval. Paging receiver (PR) receives the paging channel transmission using RX beam other than the RX beam already used. Paging receiver receives/decodes the paging channel corresponding to best TX beam. In an exemplary embodiment, if paging receiver fails to decode paging channel corresponding to best TX beam it receive/decode other paging channel transmissions corresponding to TX beam other than determined best TX beam. In another exemplary embodiment, if paging receiver fails to decode paging channel corresponding to best TX beam it does not receive/decode other paging channel transmissions corresponding to TX beam other than determined best TX beam.     Figure 11 illustrates a schematic diagram depicting transmission and reception of paging information on a paging channel using N transmitting (TX) beams and repeated P times in paging available interval, according to yet another embodiment.     According to one embodiment of the Paging Channel Transmission, the paging channel carrying paging information is transmitted using N transmitting (TX) beams and repeated P times in the paging available interval. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N different time durations if only one antenna array is available with paging transmitter (PT) for transmitting paging channel. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N/2 different time durations if two antenna arrays are available with paging transmitter (PT) for transmitting paging channel and so on. The number of repetition P is equal to number of RX beams which means that set of transmissions using N TX beams is repeated P times. The repetition of TX beams may be in same paging SF or in different paging SF. The number of repetition may be fixed for all paging receivers or it can be different for different paging receivers. There may be different group of paging receivers in network with different RX beamforming capability. For example, some may have two RX beams while others may have four RX beams. Based on paging receivers capability the network may group paging receivers in different groups and each group may be paged in different times with different repetition of TX beams. Paging receiver (PR) indicates its capability of RX beamforming to network when it attaches with the network. This information can be used by the network to form paging receiver groups and apply different repetition for paging channel transmissions. The number of paging channel TX beams in this embodiment of the disclosure may or may not be equal to number of SCH/BCH beams.     In this embodiment the paging channel not only carries the paging information but it also carries the information transmitted in the BCH. A paging synchronization channel (carrying synchronization signal) is also transmitted before each paging channel transmission using the same beam as the beam used for paging channel transmission. Sequence used for synchronization signal in paging synchronization channel preceding the paging channel is different from sequence used for synchronization signal preceding the BCH. Paging synchronization channel in paging channel sub frame is transmitted only if paging is present. If there is no paging then paging synchronization channel and paging channel is not transmitted. Paging synchronization channel preceding the paging channel is used for DL synchronization as well as to detect paging.     The resources for paging channel transmissions in paging SF may be fixed or indicated by control channel. If the resources are indicated using the control channel then after receiving the synchronization signal transmitted before paging channel, paging receiver (PR) will receive control channel and then decode the paging channel. In this case synchronization signal, control channel and paging channel are transmitted one after another using the same beam and repeated for multiple TX beams.     Figure 12 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver (PR), according to yet another embodiment. The paging receiver needs to wake up only at the SF carrying the paging. The paging receiver does not need to receive and decode SCH/BCH for receiving paging. In the exemplary embodiment as illustrated in Figure 12, paging receiver wakes up at the beginning of the paging location (e.g. Paging sub frame in a paging available interval frame) in the paging available interval. The paging receiver monitors the time duration where the first set of paging synchronization channel & paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. The paging receiver receives the paging synchronization channel & paging channel transmissions using the first RX beam (any RX beam). If paging receiver is able to receive the paging synchronization signal, it will decode the paging channel following the paging synchronization signal and receive the paging and BCH information. If paging receiver fails to receive and decode the paging synchronization channel & paging channel using the selected RX beam in the time duration where the first set of paging synchronization channel & paging channel are transmitted then paging receiver monitors the time duration where the next set of paging synchronization channel & paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. The paging receiver receives the paging channel transmission using RX beam other than the RX beam already used.     In this embodiment paging receiver does not receive and decodes the SCH/BCH in every paging available interval. As a result paging receiver will not have information about the paging area change in case paging is not there in paging available interval as the paging area change information is present in the BCH. In order to solve this problem, the present embodiment performs a timer based location search wherein the paging receiver receives and decodes the SCH/BCH only if the location search timer is expired before the paging available interval. Location search timer is reset every time paging area information is read from BCH or BCH information carried in the paging channel. If the location search timer is not expired than paging receiver will not receive and decode the SCH/BCH in the paging available interval. It will only receive and decode the paging synchronization channel transmitted before paging channel and the paging channel.     Figure 13 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver, according to yet another embodiment.     Location Update: In this exemplary embodiment, wherein the paging receiver (PR) monitors the SCH/BCH in the paging available interval, the paging receiver procedure is executed only when the location search timer is expired before the paging available interval. Paging receiver determines the wakeup time wherein the wake up time is determined based on the paging location (e.g. Paging sub frame in a paging available interval frame) in the paging available interval and number of receive beams supported by the paging receiver. Paging receiver wakes up at the determined wake up time and start searching for SCH & BCH. Paging receiver performs the DL synchronization using the received SCH/BCH. Paging receiver monitors the time duration where the first set of paging synchronization channel & paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives the paging synchronization channel & paging channel transmissions using the first RX beam (any RX beam or the best RX beam determined using SCH/BCH). If paging receiver fails to receive and decode the paging synchronization channel & paging channel using the selected RX beam in the time duration where the first set of paging synchronization channel & paging channel are transmitted then paging receiver monitors the time duration where the next set of paging synchronization channel & paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmission using RX beam other than the RX beam already used.     Paging receiver may also execute the procedure as explained in figure 7, 8, 9 &10 in case the paging receiver monitors the SCH/BCH in the paging available interval wherein the paging receiver monitors the SCH/BCH in the paging available interval if the location search timer is expired before the paging available interval.     Figure 14 & Figure 15 illustrate a schematic diagram depicting transmission and reception of paging information on a paging channel using N transmitting (TX) beams, according to another embodiment.     According to one embodiment of the Paging Channel Transmission,the paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N different time durations if only one antenna array is available with paging transmitter (PT)for transmitting paging channel. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N/2 different time durations if two antenna arrays are available with paging transmitter (PT)for transmitting paging channel and so on. The paging channel transmission using N TX beams is repeated for P-1 receives (RX) beams in paging receiver where P is the number of receive beams in paging receiver (PR). In a beam-formed system paging receiver typically receives the transmission using multiple RX beams wherein the paging receiver uses one RX beam to receive one set of N TX beams and same is repeated for each RX beam. The number of paging channel TX beams in this embodiment of the present disclosure may or may not be equal to number of SCH/BCH beams.     In this embodiment, the paging channel not only carries the paging information but it also carries the information transmitted in the BCH. A paging synchronization channel (carrying synchronization signal) is also transmitted before each paging channel transmission using the same beam as the beam used for paging channel transmission. Sequence used for synchronization signal in paging synchronization channel preceding the paging channel is different from sequence used for synchronization signal preceding the BCH. Paging synchronization channel in paging channel sub frame is transmitted only if paging is there. If there is no paging then paging synchronization channel and paging channel is not transmitted. Paging synchronization channel preceding the paging channel is used for DL synchronization as well as to detect paging.     The resources for paging channel transmissions in paging SF may be fixed or indicated by control channel. If the resources are indicated using the control channel then after receiving the synchronization signal transmitted before paging channel, paging receiver will receive control channel and then decode the paging channel. In this case paging synchronization signal, control channel and paging channel are transmitted one after another using the same beam and repeated for multiple TX beams.     Figure 16 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver (PR), according to another embodiment.     According to one embodiment of the Paging Channel Reception,the paging receiver wakes up only at the beginning of paging available interval. Paging receiver monitors the time duration where the SCH/BCH using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives the SCH/BCH transmission using the first RX beam (any RX beam).     If the SCH/BCH is successfully received paging receiver performs the DL synchronization using the received SCH/BCH. Paging receiver monitors the time duration where the first set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmissions corresponding to N TX beams using the RX beam used for receiving SCH/BCH. If the Paging channel is not successfully received then paging receiver monitors the time duration where the next set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted (if available, otherwise stop receiving paging). Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmission using RX beam other than the RX beam already used. Paging receiver may receive paging channel corresponding to the TX beam of SCH/BCH reception.     If the SCH/BCH is not successfully received, the paging receiver monitors the time duration where the first set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted. Paging receiver receives the paging synchronization channel & paging channel transmissions corresponding to N TX beams using the RX beam not already used. If the Paging synchronization channel & paging channel is not successfully received then paging receiver monitors the time duration where the next set of paging channel transmissions using N TX beams are transmitted (if available, otherwise stop receiving paging). Paging receiver receives the paging synchronization channel & paging channel transmissions corresponding to N TX beams using the RX beam not already used.     Location Update: In this embodiment paging receiver does not receive and decodes the SCH/BCH in every paging available interval. As a result paging receiver will not have information about the paging area change in case paging is not there in paging available interval as the paging area change information is present in the BCH. In order to overcome this problem, the embodiment provides a timer based location search wherein the paging receiver receives and decodes the SCH/BCH only if the location search timer is expired before the paging available interval. Location search timer is reset every time paging area information is read from BCH or BCH information carried in the paging channel. If the location search timer is not expired than paging receiver will not receive and decode the SCH/BCH in the paging available interval. It will only receive and decode the paging synchronization channel transmitted before paging channel and the paging channel.     Figure 17 illustrates a schematic diagram depicting transmission and reception of paging information on a paging channel using N transmitting (TX) beams in a paging available interval, according to another embodiment.     According to an embodiment of the Paging Channel Transmission, , the paging channel carrying paging information is transmitted using N transmitting (TX) beams in the paging available interval. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N different time durations if only one antenna array is available with paging transmitter (PT) for transmitting paging channel. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N/2 different time durations if two antenna arrays are available with paging transmitter (PT) for transmitting paging channel and so on. The paging channel transmission using N TX beams is not repeated for multiple receive (RX) beams in paging receiver (PR) which means that only one set of N TX beams is transmitted by paging transmitter (PT). In a beam-formed system paging receiver typically receives the transmission using multiple RX beams wherein the paging receiver uses one RX beam to receive one set of N TX beams and same is repeated for each RX beam.     The paging available interval can be of one frame duration wherein each frame comprises of multiple sub frames. Paging channel may be present in one or more SFs of paging available interval wherein the paging channel in different SFs carries different paging information (e.g. Different set of paging receivers may be assigned different SF for paging). The number of paging channel TX beams in this embodiment of the present disclosure is equal to number of synchronization/BCH beams. The order of transmission of TX beams for paging channel is same as order of synchronization/BCH beams. Paging channel sub frame for paging may be fixed (pre-specified) i.e. paging channel for all paging receivers in a paging available interval is fixed. Alternatively paging channel SF in paging available interval can be specific to paging receiver. BCH may indicate if paging is there in PAI or not. BCH of PAI Frame and up to P frames before PAI should include paging indicator for paging in PAI Frame. The resources for paging channel transmissions in paging SF may be fixed or indicated by a control channel.     In this embodiment of the present disclosure additional SCH/BCH are transmitted by the paging transmitter. The additional SCH/BCH is transmitted only if paging is there in time durations (paging subframe) meant for paging. The time durations or SFs where additional SCH/BCH are transmitted depends on the location of paging SF in paging available interval and number of receive beams supported by paging receiver. For the case of two receive beams, the additional SCH/BCH is transmitted in paging SF if SCH/BCH is not already present in the paging SF. For example, as illustrated in Figure 17 if paging SF is other than the SF0 in paging available interval wherein SCH/BCH is transmitted in the SF0 in the system then additional SCH/BCH are transmitted by the paging transmitter (PT) in the paging SF if paging is there in the paging SF. For the case of two receive beams, the additional SCH/BCH is transmitted in SF preceding the paging SF if SCH/BCH is already present in the paging SF. According to an exemplary embodiment as illustrated in Figure 18, if paging SF is the SF0 in paging available interval wherein SCH/BCH is transmitted in the SF0 in the system then additional SCH/BCH are transmitted by the paging transmitter (PT)in the SF preceding the paging SF if paging is there in the paging SF. For the case of P receive beams, if SCH/BCH is already present in paging SF then additional SCH/BCH are transmitted in those P-1 sub frames preceding the paging subframe where SCH/BCH is not normally transmitted. For the case of P receive beams, if SCH/BCH is not already present in paging SF then additional SCH/BCH are transmitted in those P sub frames including & preceding the paging subframe where SCH/BCH is not normally transmitted.     The additional SCH/BCH transmitted because of paging differs from normal SCH/BCH transmission as follows: In one exemplary embodiment, the preamble used for both the SCH is same but sub frame ID in BCH of normal BCH transmission and sub frame ID in BCH transmission is different. Sub frame ID in BCH will be the ID of the sub frame in which the BCH is transmitted. For example, if the normal SCH/BCH are transmitted in SF0 of every frame and additional SCH/BCH because of paging are transmitted in SF1 then BCH in SF0 will have sub frame ID set to 0, whereas BCH in SF1 will have sub frame ID set to 1. In this method, even the paging receiver which is not looking for paging can receive the SCH/BCH and can perform the DL synchronization. In another method different preamble of synchronization sequence is used for SCH during normal SCH transmission and SCH transmission during the paging. The BCH content is same in both cases. In this case the additional SCH/BCH is only read by the paging receivers looking for paging.     According to an embodiment of Paging Channel Reception,paging receiver wakes up P-1 sub frames before the beginning of paging sub frame in the paging available interval. Paging receiver monitors the P sub frames for receiving and decoding the SCH/BCH. Paging receiver monitors the P sub frames by using the P receive beams wherein different receive beam is used in different sub frames. If the SCH/BCH is received and decoded in any one of the P sub frames then paging receiver stops monitoring the SCH/BCH in remaining of the P sub frames.     Figure 19 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver (PR), according to another embodiment. The paging receiver determines the best TX beam wherein the best TX beam is the beam which is used by paging transmitter (PT) for transmission of the SCH/BCH which was successfully decoded by the paging receiver. Paging receiver also determines the best RX beam wherein the RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the SCH/BCH. The determined best RX beam and TX beam are then used to receive the paging channel transmitted by paging transmitter (PT) using multiple TX beams. Paging receiver receives the paging channel using the best RX beam. Instead of receiving all paging channels corresponding to multiple TX beams paging receiver may only receive the paging channel corresponding to the best TX beam. Alternatively paging receiver can receive the paging channel corresponding to the best TX beam and if it fails to receive and decode the paging channel it can receive and decode the paging channel corresponding to other TX beams.     Figure 20 illustrates a flow diagram of a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver(PR), according to another embodiment. The Paging receiver only determines the best RX beam wherein the best RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the SCH/BCH. The Paging receiver does not concern about the best TX beam. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmitted by the paging transmitter using multiple TX beams sequentially until the paging channel is received & decoded.     Location Update: In this embodiment paging receiver does not receive and decodes the SCH/BCH in every paging available interval. As a result paging receiver will not have information about the paging area change in case paging is not there in paging available interval as the paging area change information is present in the BCH. In order to overcome this drawback, the present disclosure provides a timer based location search wherein the paging receiver receives and decodes the SCH/BCH only if the location search timer is expired before the paging available interval. Location search timer is reset every time paging area information is read from BCH or BCH information carried in the paging channel. If the location search timer is not expired than paging receiver will not receive and decode the SCH/BCH in the paging available interval. It will only receive and decode the paging synchronization channel transmitted before paging channel and the paging channel.     Figures 21, 22, & 23 illustrate schematic diagrams depicting transmission and reception of paging information on a paging channel using N transmitting (TX) beams in a paging available interval, according to three further embodiments.     According to one embodiment of the Paging Channel Transmission, the paging channel carrying paging information is transmitted using N transmitting (TX) beams in the paging available interval as illustrated in Figure 21. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N different time durations if only one antenna array is available with paging transmitter (PT)for transmitting paging channel. The paging channel using N TX beams can be transmitted in N/2 different time durations if two antenna arrays are available with paging transmitter (PT) for transmitting paging channel and so on. The paging channel transmission using N TX beams is not repeated for multiple receive (RX) beams in paging receiver which means that only one set of N TX beams is transmitted by paging transmitter. In a beam-formed system paging receiver (PR) typically receives the transmission using multiple RX beams wherein the paging receiver uses one RX beam to receive one set of N TX beams and same is repeated for each RX beam.     The paging available interval can be of one frame duration wherein each frame comprises of multiple sub frames. Paging channel may be present in one or more SFs of paging available interval wherein the paging channel in different SFs carries different paging information (e.g. Different set of paging receivers may be assigned different SF for paging). The number of paging channel TX beams in this embodiment of the disclosure is equal to number of SCH/BCH beams. The order of transmission of TX beams for paging channel is same as order of SCH/BCH beams. Paging channel sub frame for paging may be fixed (pre-specified) i.e. paging channel for all paging receivers in a paging available interval is fixed. Alternatively paging channel SF in paging available interval can be specific to paging receiver. BCH may indicate if paging is there in PAI or not. BCH of PAI Frame and up to P frames before PAI should include paging indicator for paging in PAI Frame. The resources for paging channel transmissions in paging SF may be fixed or indicated by a control channel.     In this embodiment of the present disclosure additional SCH are transmitted by the paging transmitter (PT). The additional SCH is transmitted only if paging is there in time durations (paging subframe) meant for paging. The time durations or SFs where additional SCH/BCH are transmitted is before the SF in which normal SCH/BCH are transmitted in paging available interval. The number of additional SCH transmissions is equal to P or P-1 where P is the number of received beams in paging receiver. For the case of two received beams, the additional SCH is transmitted in SF before the beginning of paging available interval as illustrated in Figure 21, Figure 22 & Figure 23. Each set of additional SCH transmission comprises of transmissions using multiple TX beams. Two sets of additional SCH transmission comprises of transmissions using multiple TX beams, is transmitted in SF before the beginning of paging available interval which is in case of two receive beams in paging receiver. This is illustrated in Figure 21. Alternately one set of additional SCH transmission comprises of transmissions using multiple TX beams, is transmitted in SF before the beginning of paging available interval in case of two receive beams in paging receiver(PR). This is illustrated in Figure 22 & Figure 23. The additional SCH transmissions are present only when paging is there in the paging available interval.     The additional SCH transmitted because of paging, differs from normal SCH transmission as follows: Different preamble or synchronization sequence is used for SCH during normal SCH transmission and additional SCH transmissions because of paging.     In the embodiment of the Paging Channel Reception, paging receiver wakes up before the beginning of paging available interval. The number of sub frames to wake up earlier depends on the number of sub frames defined in system for transmitting the additional SCH transmissions. Paging receiver monitors the time durations for additional SCH transmissions.     Figures 24 & 25 illustrate two flowcharts depicting a method of receiving paging information by paging receiver (PR), according to two embodiments.     Paging receiver monitors the time durations for additional SCH transmissions using the P receive beams wherein different receive beam is used to receive different set of SCH transmissions. If the SCH is received and decoded in any one set of additional SCH transmissions paging receiver stops monitoring the SCH. The paging receiver then determines the best RX beam wherein the RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the SCH. paging receiver uses the best RX beam to decode the BCH transmissions. Paging receiver may sequentially receive and decode the BCH transmissions corresponding to multiple TX beams or it can decode the BCH transmission corresponding to the best TX beam wherein the best TX beam is the beam which is used by paging transmitter (PT)for transmission of the BCH which was successfully decoded by the paging receiver. After decoding the BCH transmission paging receiver receives and decodes the paging channel. In one exemplary method as illustrated in Figure 24, in order to receive and decode the paging channel, paging receiver determines the best TX beam wherein the best TX beam is the beam which is used by paging transmitter (PT) for transmission of the BCH which was successfully decoded by the paging receiver and paging receiver also determines the best RX beam wherein the best RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the SCH. The determined best RX beam and TX beam are then used to receive the paging channel transmitted by paging transmitter (PT) using multiple TX beams. The paging receiver receives the paging channel using the best RX beam. Instead of receiving all paging channels corresponding to multiple TX beams paging receiver may only receive the paging channel corresponding to the best TX beam. Alternatively paging receiver can receive the paging channel corresponding to the best TX beam and if it fails to receive and decode the paging channel it can receive and decode the paging channel corresponding to other TX beams. In another method as illustrated in Figure 25 in order to receive and decode the paging channel, paging receiver only determines the best RX beam wherein the RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the BCH. The paging receiver does not care about the best TX beam. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmitted by the paging transmitter using multiple TX beams sequentially until the paging channel is received & decoded.     Figures 26 & 27 illustrate two flowcharts depicting a method of receiving paging information by a paging receiver (PR), according to two embodiments.     The paging receiver monitors the time durations for additional SCH transmissions using the P-1 receive beams wherein different receive beam is used to receive different set of SCH transmissions. If the SCH is received and decoded in any one set of additional SCH transmissions paging receiver stops monitoring the SCH. Paging receiver then determines the best RX beam wherein the RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the SCH. paging receiver uses the best RX beam to decode the BCH transmissions. Paging receiver may sequentially receive and decode the BCH transmissions corresponding to multiple TX beams or it can decode the BCH transmission corresponding to the best TX beam wherein the best TX beam is the beam which is used by paging transmitter for transmission of the BCH which was successfully decoded by the paging receiver (PR). After decoding the BCH transmission, the paging receiver receives and decodes the paging channel. In one method as illustrated in Figures 26a to 26b in order to receive and decode the paging channel, paging receiver determines the best TX beam wherein the best TX beam is the beam which is used by paging transmitter (PT) for transmission of the BCH which was successfully decoded by the paging receiver, and paging receiver also determines the best RX beam wherein the best RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the SCH. The determined best RX beam and TX beam are then used to receive the paging channel transmitted by paging transmitter (PT) using multiple TX beams. paging receiver receives the paging channel using the best RX beam. Instead of receiving all paging channels corresponding to multiple TX beams paging receiver may only receive the paging channel corresponding to the best TX beam. Alternatively paging receiver can receive the paging channel corresponding to the best TX beam and if it fails to receive and decode the paging channel it can receive and decode the paging channel corresponding to other TX beams. In another exemplary method as illustrated in Figures 27a to 27b in order to receive and decode the paging channel, paging receiver only determines the best RX beam wherein the RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the BCH. The paging receiver does not care about the best TX beam. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmitted by the paging transmitter using multiple TX beams sequentially until the paging channel is received & decoded.     If the SCH is not received and decoded in any one set of additional SCH transmissions, the paging receiver monitors the normal SCH/BCH transmission. Paging receiver then determines the best RX beam wherein the RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the SCH/BCH. After decoding the SCH/BCH transmission paging receiver receives and decodes the paging channel. In one method as illustrated in Figures 26a to 26b in order to receive and decode the paging channel, paging receiver determines the best TX beam wherein the best TX beam is the beam which is used by paging transmitter (PT)for transmission of the SCH/BCH which was successfully decoded by the paging receiver and paging receiver also determines the best RX beam wherein the RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the SCH/BCH. The determined best RX beam and TX beam are then used to receive the paging channel transmitted by paging transmitter (PT) using multiple TX beams. Paging receiver receives the paging channel using the best RX beam. Instead of receiving all paging channels corresponding to multiple TX beams paging receiver may only receive the paging channel corresponding to the best TX beam. Alternatively paging receiver can receive the paging channel corresponding to the best TX beam and if it fails to receive and decode the paging channel it can receive and decode the paging channel corresponding to other TX beams. In another method as illustrated in Figures 27a to 27b in order to receive and decode the paging channel, paging receiver only determines the best RX beam wherein the RX beam is the one which is used by the paging receiver to successfully receive and decode the SCH/BCH. Paging receiver does not care about the best TX beam. Paging receiver receives the paging channel transmitted by the paging transmitter (PT) using multiple TX beams sequentially until the paging channel is received & decoded.     Location Update: In this embodiment paging receiver (PR) does not receive and decodes the SCH/BCH in every paging available interval. As a result paging receiver will not have information about the paging area change in case paging is not there in paging available interval as the paging area change information is present in the BCH. In order to solve this problem we propose a timer based location search wherein the paging receiver receives and decodes the SCH/BCH only if the location search timer is expired before the paging available interval. Location search timer is reset every time paging area information is read from BCH or BCH information carried in the paging channel. If the location search timer is not expired than paging receiver will not receive and decode the SCH/BCH in the paging available interval. It will only receive and decode the paging synchronization channel transmitted before paging channel and the paging channel.     In the methods described in the present disclosure, the paging transmitter can be a base station (BS) or enhanced nodeB or any other network node. In the methods described in the disclosure the paging receiver can be user equipment (UE) or mobile station or any other receiver capable of receiving the paging.

Referring to FIG. 28, a transmitting apparatus 2800 includes a transmitter 2811, a controller 2813, a receiver 2815, and a storage unit 2817.     The controller 2813 controls the overall operation of the transmitting apparatus 2800. More particularly, the controller 2813 controls the transmitting apparatus 2800 to perform an operation related to paging transmission/reception.

Also described are methods of treating cancer comprising administering a therapeutically effect amount of an agent or antibody of the present invention to a patient having a tumor or cancer.","RSPO BINDING AGENTS AND USES THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention      [0001] The field of this invention generally relates to antibodies and other agents that bind R-Spondin proteins (RSPO), particularly human R-Spondin proteins including RSPOl, RSP02 and RSP03, as well as to methods of using the antibodies or other agents for the treatment of diseases such as cancer.      Background of the Invention      [0002] The R-Spondin (RSPO) family of proteins is conserved among vertebrates and comprises four members, RSPOl, RSP02, RSP03 and RSP04. These proteins have been referred to by a variety of names, including roof plate-specific spondins, hPWTSR (hRSP03), THS2D (RSP03), Cristin 1-4, and Futrin 1-4. The RSPOs are small secreted proteins that overall share approximately 40-60% sequence homology and domain organization. All RSPO proteins contain two furin-like cysteine-rich domains at the N- terminus followed by a thrombospondin domain and a basic charged C-terminal tail (Kim et al, 2006, Cell Cycle, 5:23-26).      [0003] Studies have shown that RSPO proteins have a role during vertebrate development     (Kamata et al., 2004, Biochim. Biophys Acta, 1676:51-62) and in Xenopus myogenesis (Kazanskaya et al., 2004, Dev. Cell, 7:525-534). RSPOl has also been shown to function as a potent mitogen for gastrointestinal epithelial cells (Kim et al., 2005, Science, 309:1256-1259). RSPO proteins are known to activate -catenin signaling similar to Wnt signaling, however the relationship between RSPO proteins and Wnt signaling is still being investigated. It has been reported that RSPO proteins possess a positive modulatory activity on Wnt ligands (Nam et al, 2006, JBC 281 :13247-57). This study also reported that RSPO proteins could function as Frizzled8 and LRP6 receptor ligands and induce -catenin signaling (Nam et al., 2006, JBC 281 :13247-57). Recent studies have identified an interaction between RSPO proteins and LGR (leucine-rich repeat containing, G protein-coupler receptor) proteins, such as LGR5 (U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2009/0074782 and 2009/0191205), and these data present an alternative pathway for the activation of -catenin signaling.      [0004] The Wnt signaling pathway has been identified as a potential target for cancer therapy. The Wnt signaling pathway is one of several critical regulators of embryonic pattern formation, post-embryonic tissue maintenance, and stem cell biology. More specifically, Wnt signaling plays an important role in the generation of cell polarity and cell fate specification including self-renewal by stem cell populations. Unregulated activation of the Wnt pathway is associated with numerous human cancers where it is believed the activation can alter the developmental fate of cells. The activation of the Wnt pathway may maintain tumor cells in an undifferentiated state and/or lead to uncontrolled proliferation. Thus carcinogenesis can proceed by overtaking homeostatic mechanisms which control normal development and tissue repair (reviewed in Reya & Clevers, 2005, Nature, 434:843-50; Beachy et al, 2004, Nature, 432:324-31).      [0005] The Wnt signaling pathway was first elucidated in the Drosophila developmental mutant wingless (wg) and from the murine proto-oncogene int-1, now Wntl (Nusse & Varmus, 1982, Cell, 31 :99-109; Van Ooyen & Nusse, 1984, Cell, 39:233-40; Cabrera et al., 1987, Cell, 50:659-63; Rijsewijk et al., 1987, Cell, 50:649-57). Wnt genes encode secreted lipid-modified glycoproteins of which 19 have been identified in mammals. These secreted ligands activate a receptor complex consisting of a Frizzled (FZD) receptor family member and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6). The FZD receptors are seven transmembrane domain proteins of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and contain a large extracellular N-terminal ligand binding domain with 10 conserved cysteines, known as a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) or Fri domain. There are ten human FZD receptors, FZD1, FZD2, FZD3, FZD4, FZD5, FZD6, FZD7, FZD8, FZD9, and FZD 10. Different FZD CRDs have different binding affinities for specific Wnt proteins (Wu & Nusse, 2002, J Biol. Chem., 277:41762-9), and FZD receptors have been grouped into those that activate the canonical -catenin pathway and those that activate non-canonical pathways (Miller et al., 1999, Oncogene, 18:7860- 72).      [0006] A role for Wnt signaling in cancer was first uncovered with the identification of     Wntl (originally intl) as an oncogene in mammary tumors transformed by the nearby insertion of a murine virus (Nusse & Varmus, 1982, Cell, 31 :99-109). Additional evidence for the role of Wnt signaling in breast cancer has since accumulated. For instance, transgenic over-expression of -catenin in the mammary glands results in hyperplasias and adenocarcinomas (Imbert et al., 2001, J Cell Biol., 153:555-68; Michaelson & Leder, 2001, Oncogene, 20:5093-9) whereas loss of Wnt signaling disrupts normal mammary gland development (Tepera et al., 2003, J Cell Sci., 116: 1137-49; Hatsell et al., 2003, J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia, 8:145-58). In human breast cancer, -catenin accumulation implicates activated Wnt signaling in over 50% of carcinomas, and though specific mutations have not been identified, up-regulation of Frizzled receptor expression has been observed (Brennan & Brown, 2004, J Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia, 9:1 19-31 ; Malovanovic et al., 2004, Int. J Oncol, 25: 1337-42).      [0007] Activation of the Wnt pathway is also associated with colorectal cancer.      Approximately 5-10% of all colorectal cancers are hereditary with one of the main forms being familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant disease in which about 80%) of affected individuals contain a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Mutations have also been identified in other Wnt pathway components including Axin and -catenin. Individual adenomas are clonal outgrowths of epithelial cells containing a second inactivated allele, and the large number of FAP adenomas inevitably results in the development of adenocarcinomas through additional mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, including loss-of-function mutations in APC and stabilizing mutations in -catenin, can induce hyperplastic development and tumor growth in mouse models (Oshima et al., 1997, Cancer Res., 57:1644-9; Harada et al., 1999, EMBO J, 18:5931-42).      [0008] Similar to breast cancer and colon cancer, melanoma often has constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway, as indicated by the nuclear accumulation of -catenin. Activation of the<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""115441282-imgf000004_0001"" />pathway in some melanoma tumors and cell lines is due to modifications in pathway components, such as APC, ICAT, LEF1 and -catenin (see e.g., Larue et al. 2006, Frontiers Biosci., 1 1 :733-742). However, there are conflicting reports in the literature as to the exact role of<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""115441282-imgf000004_0002"" />signaling in melanoma. For example, one study found that elevated levels of nuclear -catenin correlated with improved survival from melanoma, and that activated Wnt/p-catenin signaling was associated with decreased cell proliferation (Chien et al, 2009, PNAS, 106: 1 193-1198).      [0009] The focus of cancer drug research is shifting toward targeted therapies aimed at genes, proteins, and pathways involved in human cancer. There is a need for new agents targeting signaling pathways and new combinations of agents that target multiple pathways that could provide therapeutic benefit for cancer patients. Thus, biomolecules (e.g., anti-RSPO antibodies) that disrupt -catenin signaling are a potential source of new therapeutic agents for cancer, as well as other -catenin-associated diseases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION      [0060] The present invention provides novel agents, including, but not limited to polypeptides such as antibodies, that bind RSPO proteins (e.g., human RSPOl, RSP02, and/or RSP03). The RSPO-binding agents include antagonists of -catenin signaling. Related polypeptides and polynucleotides, compositions comprising the RSPO-binding agents, and methods of making the RSPO-binding agents are also provided. Methods of using the novel RSPO-binding agents, such as methods of inhibiting tumor growth, methods of treating cancer, methods of reducing the frequency of cancer stem cells in a tumor, methods of inhibiting -catenin signaling, and/or methods of identifying and/or selecting subjects for treatment, are further provided.      [0061] Monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind human RSPOl have been identified - monoclonal antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, 89M7, 89M19 and 89M25 (Example 5, Fig. 5). Anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, and 89M25 inhibit -catenin signaling (Example 6, Fig. 6). Anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, and 89M25 block soluble RSPOl binding to LGR5 (Example 7, Fig. 7). Sequence data subsequently demonstrated that antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, and 89M25 contain the same heavy chain and light chain variable regions, and it was concluded that these antibodies would comprise the same antigen-binding site. Anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M4, 89M5, 89M7 and 89M25 have binding affinities for both human and mouse RSPOl of less than 0.1 nM (Example 8). A humanized version of 89M5 was produced, h89M5-H2L2 (Example 19) and has a binding affinity for human RSPOl of less than 0.1 nM (Example 20). Anti- RSPOl antibodies 89M5 and 89M25 have been found to inhibit tumor cell growth in vivo in an ovarian tumor xenograft model as single agents and in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent (Example 9, Fig. 8). Anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth in vivo in a pancreatic tumor xenograft model in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent (Example 17, Fig. 15). Preliminary epitope mapping studies suggest that amino acids within the furin2 domain of RSPOl are involved in the binding site for anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 (Example 10, Fig. 9).      [0062] In addition, monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind human RSP02 have been identified monoclonal antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 (Example 1 1, Fig. 10). Anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 were shown to reduce or completely block -catenin signaling (Example 12, Fig. 11). Anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23 and 130M24 block soluble RSP02 binding to LGR5 (Example 13, Fig. 12). Anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 has a binding affinity for human RSP02 of 0.14nM and mouse RSP02 of 0.35nM (Example 15). Humanized versions of 130M23 were produced, hl30M23-HlL2 and hl30M23-HlL6 (Example 19). Anti-RSP02 antibody hl30M23-HlL2 has a binding affinity for human RSP02 of 0.13nM and hl30M23-HlL6 has a binding affinity for human RSP02 of 0.15nM (Example 20). Anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth in vivo in a pancreatic tumor xenograft model as a single agent and in combination with additional therapeutic agents (Examples 17 and 18, Figs. 15 and 16).      I. Definitions      [0063] To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and phrases are defined below. [0064] The terms ""antagonist"" and ""antagonistic"" as used herein refer to any molecule that partially or fully blocks, inhibits, reduces or neutralizes a biological activity of a target and/or signaling pathway (e.g., the -catenin signaling). The term ""antagonist"" is used herein to include any molecule that partially or fully blocks, inhibits, reduces or neutralizes the activity of a protein (e.g., a RSPO protein). Suitable antagonist molecules specifically include, but are not limited to, antagonist antibodies or antibody fragments.      [0065] The terms ""modulation"" and ""modulate"" as used herein refer to a change or an alteration in a biological activity. Modulation includes, but is not limited to, stimulating or inhibiting an activity. Modulation may be an increase or a decrease in activity (e.g., a decrease in RSPO signaling; a decrease in -catenin signaling), a change in binding characteristics, or any other change in the biological, functional, or immunological properties associated with the activity of a protein, pathway, or other biological point of interest.      [0066] The term ""antibody"" as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin molecule that recognizes and specifically binds a target, such as a protein, polypeptide, peptide, carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, or combinations of the foregoing, through at least one antigen recognition site within the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term encompasses intact polyclonal antibodies, intact monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments), single chain Fv (scFv) antibodies, multispecific antibodies such as bispecific antibodies generated from at least two intact antibodies, monospecific antibodies, monovalent antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, fusion proteins comprising an antigen determination portion of an antibody, and any other modified immunoglobulin molecule comprising an antigen recognition site as long as the antibodies exhibit the desired biological activity. An antibody can be any of the five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, or subclasses (isotypes) thereof (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2), based on the identity of their heavy-chain constant domains referred to as alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The different classes of immunoglobulins have different and well-known subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations. Antibodies can be naked or conjugated to other molecules, including but not limited to, toxins and radioisotopes. [0067] The term ""antibody fragment"" refers to a portion of an intact antibody and refers to the antigenic determining variable regions of an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments, linear antibodies, single chain antibodies, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. ""Antibody fragment"" as used herein comprises an antigen-binding site or epitope binding site.      [0068] The term ""variable region"" of an antibody refers to the variable region of the antibody light chain, or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. The variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR) connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs), also known as ""hypervariable regions"". The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the framework regions and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding sites of the antibody. There are at least two techniques for determining CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Edition, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD.), and (2) an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997, J Mol. Biol, 273:927-948). In addition, combinations of these two approaches are sometimes used in the art to determine CDRs.      [0069] The term ""monoclonal antibody"" as used herein refers to a homogenous antibody population involved in the highly specific recognition and binding of a single antigenic determinant or epitope. This is in contrast to polyclonal antibodies that typically include a mixture of different antibodies directed against different antigenic determinants. The term ""monoclonal antibody"" encompasses both intact and full-length monoclonal antibodies as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv), single chain (scFv) antibodies, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified immunoglobulin molecule comprising an antigen recognition site (antigen-binding site). Furthermore, ""monoclonal antibody"" refers to such antibodies made by any number of techniques, including but not limited to, hybridoma production, phage selection, recombinant expression, and transgenic animals. [0070] The term ""humanized antibody"" as used herein refers to forms of non-human     (e.g., murine) antibodies that are specific immunoglobulin chains, chimeric immunoglobulins, or fragments thereof that contain minimal non-human sequences. Typically, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins in which residues of the CDRs are replaced by residues from the CDRs of a non-human species (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, or hamster) that have the desired specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability (Jones et al., 1986, Nature, 321 :522-525; Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature, 332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science, 239: 1534-1536). In some instances, the Fv framework region residues of a human immunoglobulin are replaced with the corresponding residues in an antibody from a non-human species that has the desired specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability. The humanized antibody can be further modified by the substitution of additional residues either in the Fv framework region and/or within the replaced non- human residues to refine and optimize antibody specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two or three, variable domains containing all or substantially all of the CDRs that correspond to the non-human immunoglobulin whereas all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody can also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Examples of methods used to generate humanized antibodies are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. 5,225,539.      [0071] The term ""human antibody"" as used herein refers to an antibody produced by a human or an antibody having an amino acid sequence corresponding to an antibody produced by a human made using any of the techniques known in the art. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.      [0072] The term ""chimeric antibody"" as used herein refers to an antibody wherein the amino acid sequence of the immunoglobulin molecule is derived from two or more species. Typically, the variable region of both light and heavy chains corresponds to the variable region of antibodies derived from one species of mammals (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, etc.) with the desired specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability, while the constant regions are homologous to the sequences in antibodies derived from another species (usually human) to avoid eliciting an immune response in that species.      [0073] The phrase ""affinity matured antibody"" as used herein refers to an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof that result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody that does not possess those alterations(s). Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. For example, Marks et al., 1992, Bio/Technology 10:779- 783, describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by Barbas et al., 1994, PNAS, 91 :3809-3813; Schier et al., 1995, Gene, 169: 147-155; Yelton et al., 1995, J Immunol. 155:1994-2004; Jackson et al., 1995, J. Immunol, 154:3310-9; and Hawkins et al., 1992, J Mol. Biol, 226:889-896.      [0074] The terms ""epitope"" and ""antigenic determinant"" are used interchangeably herein and refer to that portion of an antigen capable of being recognized and specifically bound by a particular antibody. When the antigen is a polypeptide, epitopes can be formed both from contiguous amino acids and noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids (also referred to as linear epitopes) are typically retained upon protein denaturing, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding (also referred to as conformational epitopes) are typically lost upon protein denaturing. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation.      [0075] The terms ""selectively binds"" or ""specifically binds"" mean that a binding agent or an antibody reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration, with greater affinity, or with some combination of the above to the epitope, protein or target molecule than with alternative substances, including unrelated proteins. In certain embodiments ""specifically binds"" means, for instance, that an antibody binds a protein with a D of about 0.1 mM or less, but more usually less than about  . In certain embodiments, ""specifically binds"" means that an antibody binds a target at times with a KD of at least about 0.1  or less, at other times at least about 0.01  or less, and at other times at least about InM or less. Because of the sequence identity between homologous proteins in different species, specific binding can include an antibody that recognizes a protein in more than one species (e.g., human RSPOl and mouse RSPOl). Likewise, because of homology within certain regions of polypeptide sequences of different proteins, specific binding can include an antibody (or other polypeptide or binding agent) that recognizes more than one protein (e.g., human RSPOl and human RSP02). It is understood that, in certain embodiments, an antibody or binding moiety that specifically binds a first target may or may not specifically bind a second target. As such, ""specific binding"" does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding, i.e. binding to a single target. Thus, an antibody may, in certain embodiments, specifically bind more than one target. In certain embodiments, multiple targets may be bound by the same antigen-binding site on the antibody. For example, an antibody may, in certain instances, comprise two identical antigen-binding sites, each of which specifically binds the same epitope on two or more proteins (e.g., RSPOl and RSP02). In certain alternative embodiments, an antibody may be bispecific or multispecific and comprise at least two antigen-binding sites with differing specificities. By way of non- limiting example, a bispecific antibody may comprise one antigen-binding site that recognizes an epitope on one protein (e.g., human RSPOl) and further comprise a second, different antigen-binding site that recognizes a different epitope on a second protein. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means specific binding.      [0076] The terms ""polypeptide"" and ""peptide"" and ""protein"" are used interchangeably herein and refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids), as well as other modifications known in the art. It is understood that, because the polypeptides of this invention may be based upon antibodies, in certain embodiments, the polypeptides can occur as single chains or associated chains. jj0077] The terms ""polynucleotide"" and ""nucleic acid"" are used interchangeably herein and refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or R A polymerase.      ""Conditions of high stringency"" may be identified by those that: (1) employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing, for example 15mM sodium chloride/ 1.5 mM sodium citrate/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50C; (2) employ during hybridization a denaturing agent, such as formamide, for example, 50% (v/v) formamide with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Ficoll/0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone/5 OmM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750mM sodium chloride, 75mM sodium citrate at 42C; or (3) employ 50% formamide, 5x SSC (0.75M NaCl, 75mM sodium citrate), 50mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 5x Denhardt's solution, sonicated salmon sperm DNA (50g/ml), 0.1% SDS, and 10% dextran sulfate at 42C, with washes at 42C in 0.2x SSC and 50% formamide at 55C, followed by a high- stringency wash consisting of 0.1 x SSC containing EDTA at 55C.      The terms ""identical"" or percent ""identity"" in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptides, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned (introducing gaps, if necessary) for maximum correspondence, not considering any conservative amino acid substitutions as part of the sequence identity. The percent identity may be measured using sequence comparison software or algorithms or by visual inspection. Various algorithms and software that may be used to obtain alignments of amino acid or nucleotide sequences are well-known in the art. These include, but are not limited to, BLAST, ALIGN, Megalign, BestFit, GCG Wisconsin Package, and variants thereof. In some embodiments, two nucleic acids or polypeptides of the invention are substantially identical, meaning they have at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, and in some embodiments at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%), 99% nucleotide or amino acid residue identity, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using a sequence comparison algorithm or by visual inspection. In some embodiments, identity exists over a region of the sequences that is at least about 10, at least about 20, at least about 40-60 residues, at least about 60-80 residues in length or any integral value therebetween. In some embodiments, identity exists over a longer region than 60-80 residues, such as at least about 80-100 residues, and in some embodiments the sequences are substantially identical over the full length of the sequences being compared, such as the coding region of a nucleotide sequence.      [0080] A ""conservative amino acid substitution"" is one in which one amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). For example, substitution of a phenylalanine for a tyrosine is a conservative substitution. Preferably, conservative substitutions in the sequences of the polypeptides and antibodies of the invention do not abrogate the binding of the polypeptide or antibody containing the amino acid sequence, to the antigen(s), i.e., the one or more RSPO protein(s) to which the polypeptide or antibody binds. Methods of identifying nucleotide and amino acid conservative substitutions which do not eliminate antigen binding are well-known in the art.      [0081] The term ""vector"" as used herein means a construct, which is capable of delivering, and usually expressing, one or more gene(s) or sequence(s) of interest in a host cell. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, viral vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, plasmid, cosmid, or phage vectors, DNA or RNA expression vectors associated with cationic condensing agents, and DNA or RNA expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes.      [0082] A polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell, or composition which is     ""isolated"" is a polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell, or composition which is in a form not found in nature. Isolated polypeptides, antibodies, polynucleotides, vectors, cells or compositions include those which have been purified to a degree that they are no longer in a form in which they are found in nature. In some embodiments, a polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell, or composition which is isolated is substantially pure. [0083] The term ""substantially pure"" as used herein refers to material which is at least     50% pure (i.e., free from contaminants), at least 90% pure, at least 95% pure, at least 98% pure, or at least 99% pure.      [0084] The terms ""cancer"" and ""cancerous"" as used herein refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals in which a population of cells are characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and hematologic cancers such as lymphoma and leukemia.      [0085] The terms ""tumor"" and ""neoplasm"" as used herein refer to any mass of tissue that results from excessive cell growth or proliferation, either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous) including pre-cancerous lesions.      [0086] The term ""metastasis"" as used herein refers to the process by which a cancer spreads or transfers from the site of origin to other regions of the body with the development of a similar cancerous lesion at the new location. A ""metastatic"" or ""metastasizing"" cell is one that loses adhesive contacts with neighboring cells and migrates via the bloodstream or lymph from the primary site of disease to invade neighboring body structures.      [0087] The terms ""cancer stem cell"" and ""CSC"" and ""tumor stem cell"" and ""tumor initiating cell"" are used interchangeably herein and refer to cells from a cancer or tumor that: (1) have extensive proliferative capacity; 2) are capable of asymmetric cell division to generate one or more types of differentiated cell progeny wherein the differentiated cells have reduced proliferative or developmental potential; and (3) are capable of symmetric cell divisions for self-renewal or self-maintenance. These properties confer on the cancer stem cells the ability to form or establish a tumor or cancer upon serial transplantation into an immunocompromised host (e.g., a mouse) compared to the majority of tumor cells that fail to form tumors. Cancer stem cells undergo self-renewal versus differentiation in a chaotic manner to form tumors with abnormal cell types that can change over time as mutations occur.      [0088] The terms ""cancer cell"" and ""tumor cell"" refer to the total population of cells derived from a cancer or tumor or pre-cancerous lesion, including both non-tumorigenic cells, which comprise the bulk of the cancer cell population, and tumorigenic stem cells (cancer stem cells). As used herein, the terms ""cancer cell"" or ""tumor cell"" will be modified by the term ""non-tumorigenic"" when referring solely to those cells lacking the capacity to renew and differentiate to distinguish those tumor cells from cancer stem cells.      [0089] The term ""tumorigenic"" as used herein refers to the functional features of a cancer stem cell including the properties of self-renewal (giving rise to additional tumorigenic cancer stem cells) and proliferation to generate all other tumor cells (giving rise to differentiated and thus non-tumorigenic tumor cells).      [0090] The term ""tumorigenicity"" as used herein refers to the ability of a random sample of cells from the tumor to form palpable tumors upon serial transplantation into immunocompromised hosts (e.g., mice).      [0091] The term ""subject"" refers to any animal (e.g., a mammal), including, but not limited to, humans, non-human primates, canines, felines, rodents, and the like, which is to be the recipient of a particular treatment. Typically, the terms ""subject"" and ""patient"" are used interchangeably herein in reference to a human subject.      [0092] The term ""pharmaceutically acceptable"" refers to approved or approvable by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans.      [0093] The terms ""pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier or adjuvant"" or     ""acceptable pharmaceutical carrier"" refer to an excipient, carrier or adjuvant that can be administered to a subject, together with at least one binding agent (e.g., an antibody) of the present disclosure, and which does not destroy the pharmacological activity thereof and is nontoxic when administered in doses sufficient to deliver a therapeutic effect.      [0094] The terms ""effective amount"" or ""therapeutically effective amount"" or     ""therapeutic effect"" refer to an amount of a binding agent, an antibody, polypeptide, polynucleotide, small organic molecule, or other drug effective to ""treat"" a disease or disorder in a subject or mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of a drug (e.g., an antibody) has a therapeutic effect and as such can reduce the number of cancer cells; decrease tumorigenicity, tumorigenic frequency or tumorigenic capacity; reduce the number or frequency of cancer stem cells; reduce the tumor size; reduce the cancer cell population; inhibit or stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs including, for example, the spread of cancer into soft tissue and bone; inhibit and stop tumor or cancer cell metastasis; inhibit and stop tumor or cancer cell growth; relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer; reduce morbidity and mortality; improve quality of life; or a combination of such effects. To the extent the agent, for example an antibody, prevents growth and/or kills existing cancer cells, it can be referred to as cytostatic and/or cytotoxic.      [0095] The terms ""treating"" or ""treatment"" or ""to treat"" or ""alleviating"" or ""to alleviate"" refer to both 1) therapeutic measures that cure, slow down, lessen symptoms of, and/or halt progression of a diagnosed pathologic condition or disorder and 2) prophylactic or preventative measures that prevent or slow the development of a targeted pathologic condition or disorder. Thus those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder; those prone to have the disorder; and those in whom the disorder is to be prevented. In some embodiments, a subject is successfully ""treated"" according to the methods of the present invention if the patient shows one or more of the following: a reduction in the number of or complete absence of cancer cells; a reduction in the tumor size; inhibition of or an absence of cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs including the spread of cancer cells into soft tissue and bone; inhibition of or an absence of tumor or cancer cell metastasis; inhibition or an absence of cancer growth; relief of one or more symptoms associated with the specific cancer; reduced morbidity and mortality; improvement in quality of life; reduction in tumorigenicity; reduction in the number or frequency of cancer stem cells; or some combination of effects.      [0096] As used in the present disclosure and claims, the singular forms ""a"", ""an"" and     ""the"" include plural forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.      [0097] It is understood that wherever embodiments are described herein with the language ""comprising"" otherwise analogous embodiments described in terms of ""consisting of and/or ""consisting essentially of are also provided.      [0098] The term ""and/or"" as used in a phrase such as ""A and/or B"" herein is intended to include both A and B; A or B; A (alone); and B (alone). Likewise, the term ""and/or"" as used in a phrase such as ""A, B, and/or C"" is intended to encompass each of the following embodiments: A, B, and C; A, B, or C; A or C; A or B; B or C: A and C; A and B; B and C; A (alone); B (alone); and C (alone),      II.

In some embodiments, the antibody is a chimeric antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody is a humanized antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody is a human antibody. In certain embodiments, the antibody is an IgGl antibody. In certain embodiments, the antibody is an lgG2 antibody.

In some embodiments, the antibody is monovalent, monospecific, bivalent, bispecific, or multi specific. In some embodiments, the antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic moiety. In some embodiments, the antibody is isolated. In some embodiments, the antibody is substantially pure,      [0110] The RSPO-binding agents (e.g., antibodies) of the present invention can be assayed for specific binding by any method known in the art. The immunoassays that can be used include, but are not limited to, competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as Biacore analysis, FACS analysis, immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, Western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA, ""sandwich"" immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitation reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, and protein A immunoassays. Such assays are routine and well-known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al.. Editors, 1994-present, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY).      [0111] For example, the specific binding of an antibody to human RSPOl may be determined using ELISA. An ELISA assay comprises preparing antigen, coating wells of a 96 well microtiter plate with antigen, adding the RSPOl -binding antibody or other RSPOl -binding agent conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well, incubating for a period of time and detecting the presence of the antibody bound to the antigen. In some embodiments, the RSPOl -binding antibody or agent is not conjugated to a detectable compound, but instead a second conjugated antibody that recognizes the RSPOl -binding antibody or agent is added to the well. In some embodiments, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the RSPO-binding antibody or agent can be coated to the well and a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound can be added following the addition of the antigen to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELIS As known in the art.      [0112] In another example, the specific binding of an antibody to human RSPOl may be determined using FACS. A FACS screening assay may comprise generating a cDNA construct that expresses an antigen as a fusion protein (e.g., RSPOl-Fc or RSPOl- CD4TM), transfecting the construct into cells, expressing the antigen on the surface of the cells, mixing the RSPOl -binding antibody or other RSPOl -binding agent with the transfected cells, and incubating for a period of time. The cells bound by the RSPOl - binding antibody or other RSPO-binding agent may be identified by using a secondary antibody conjugated to a detectable compound (e.g., PE-conjugated anti-Fc antibody) and a flow cytometer. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to optimize the signal detected as well as other variations of FACS that may enhance screening (e.g., screening for blocking antibodies).      [0113] The binding affinity of an antibody or other binding-agent to an antigen (e.g., a     RSPO protein) and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., <3>H or <125>I), or fragment or variant thereof, with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen followed by the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody for an antigen (e.g., a RSPO protein) and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. In some embodiments, Biacore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies or agents that bind an antigen (e.g., a RSPO protein). Biacore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of antibodies from chips with immobilized antigen (e.g., a RSPO protein) on their surface.      [0114] In certain embodiments, the invention provides a RSPO 1 -binding agent (e.g., an antibody) that specifically binds human RSPOl, wherein the RSPOl -binding agent (e.g., an antibody) comprises one, two, three, four, five, and/or six of the CDRs of antibody 89M5 (see Table 1). In some embodiments, the RSPOl -binding agent comprises one or more of the CDRs of 89M5, two or more of the CDRs of 89M5, three or more of the CDRs of 89M5, four or more of the CDRs of 89M5, five or more of the CDRs of 89M5, or all six of the CDRs of 89M5.

In some embodiments, the humanized version of 130M23 is an IgGl antibody. In some embodiments, the humanized version of 130M23 is an IgG2 antibody. The hybridoma cell line producing the 130M23 antibody was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA, USA, under the conditions of the Budapest Treaty on August 10, 201 1 and assigned ATCC deposit designation number PTA- 12021.      [0140] In certain embodiments, a RSP02-binding agent comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of, the antibody 130M23. In certain embodiments, a RSP02-binding agent comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of, the antibody hl30M23-HlL2. In certain embodiments, a RSP02-binding agent comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of, the antibody hl30M23-HlL6.      [0141] Many proteins, including antibodies, contain a signal sequence that directs the transport of the proteins to various locations. Signal sequences (also referred to as signal peptides or leader sequences) are located at the N-terminus of nascent polypeptides. They target the polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum and the proteins are sorted to their destinations, for example, to the inner space of an organelle, to an interior membrane, to the cell's outer membrane, or to the cell exterior via secretion. Most signal sequences are cleaved from the protein by a signal peptidase after the proteins are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum. The cleavage of the signal sequence from the polypeptide usually occurs at a specific site in the amino acid sequence and is dependent upon amino acid residues within the signal sequence. Although there is usually one specific cleavage site, more than one cleavage site may be recognized and/or may be used by a signal peptidase resulting in a non-homogenous N-terminus of the polypeptide. For example, the use of different cleavage sites within a signal sequence can result in a polypeptide expressed with different N-terminal amino acids. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the polypeptides as described herein may comprise a mixture of polypeptides with different N-termini. In some embodiments, the N-termini differ in length by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 amino acids. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is substantially homogeneous, i.e., the polypeptides have the same N-terminus. In some embodiments, the signal sequence of the polypeptide comprises one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, etc.) amino acid substitutions and/or deletions as compared to a ""native"" or ""parental"" signal sequence, in some embodiments, the signal sequence of the polypeptide comprises amino acid substitutions and/or deletions that allow one cleavage site to be dominant, thereby resulting in a substantially homogeneous polypeptide with one N- terminus. In some embodiments, the signal sequence of the polypeptide is replaced with a different signal sequence. In some embodiments, a signal sequence of the polypeptide affects the expression level of the polypeptide. In some embodiments, a signal sequence of the polypeptide increases the expression level of the polypeptide. In some embodiments, a signal sequence of the polypeptide decreases the expression level of the polypeptide.

[0157] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody) inhibits - catenin signaling.

In some embodiments, a RSP02-binding agent that inhibits activation of -catenin is antibody 130M23, hl30M23-HlL2, or hl30M23-HlL6.      [0159] In vivo and in vitro assays for determining whether a RSPO-binding agent (or candidate RSPO-binding agent) inhibits -catenin signaling are known in the art. For example, cell-based, luciferase reporter assays utilizing a TCF/Luc reporter vector containing multiple copies of the TCF-binding domain upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene may be used to measure -catenin signaling levels in vitro (Gazit et al., 1999, Oncogene, 18; 5959-66; TOPflash, Millipore, Billerica MA). The level of - catenin signaling in the presence of one or more Wnts (e.g., Wnt(s) expressed by transfected cells or provided by Wnt-conditioned media) with or without a RSPO protein or RSPO-conditioned media in the presence of a RSPO-binding agent is compared to the level of signaling without the RSPO-binding agent present. In addition to the TCF/Luc reporter assay the effect of a RSPO-binding agent (or candidate agent) on -catenin signaling may be measured in vitro or in vivo by measuring the effect of the agent on the level of expression of -catenin-regulated genes, such as c-myc (He et al., 1998, Science, 281 :1509-12), cyclin Dl (Tetsu et al., 1999, Nature, 398:422-6) and/or fibronectin (Gradl et al. 1999, Mol. Cell Biol, 19:5576-87). In certain embodiments, the effect of a RSPO- binding agent on -catenin signaling may also be assessed by measuring the effect of the agent on the phosphorylation state of Dishevelled- 1, Dishevelled-2, Dishevelled-3, LRP5, LRP6, and/or -catenin.      [0160] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents have one or more of the following effects: inhibit proliferation of tumor cells, inhibit tumor growth, reduce the tumorigenicity of a tumor, reduce the tumorigenicity of a tumor by reducing the frequency of cancer stem cells in the tumor, inhibit tumor growth, trigger cell death of tumor cells, induce cells in a tumor to differentiate, differentiate tumorigenic cells to a non-tumorigenic state, induce expression of differentiation markers in the tumor cells, prevent metastasis of tumor cells, or decrease survival of tumor cells.      [0161] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents are capable of inhibiting tumor growth. In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents are capable of inhibiting tumor growth in vivo (e.g., in a xenograft mouse model, and/or in a human having cancer).      [0162] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents are capable of reducing the tumorigenicity of a tumor. In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent or antibody is capable of reducing the tumorigenicity of a tumor comprising cancer stem cells in an animal model, such as a mouse xenograft model. In certain embodiments, the number or frequency of cancer stem cells in a tumor is reduced by at least about two-fold, about three-fold, about five-fold, about ten-fold, about 50-fold, about 100-fold, or about 1000- fold. In certain embodiments, the reduction in the number or frequency of cancer stem cells is determined by limiting dilution assay using an animal model. Additional examples and guidance regarding the use of limiting dilution assays to determine a reduction in the number or frequency of cancer stem cells in a tumor can be found, e.g., in International Publication Number WO 2008/042236, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0064049, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0178305.      [0163] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents described herein have a circulating half-life in mice, cynomolgus monkeys, or humans of at least about 5 hours? at least about 10 hours, at least about 24 hours, at least about 3 days, at least about 1 week, or at least about 2 weeks. In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent is an IgG (e.g., IgGl or IgG2) antibody that has a circulating half-life in mice, cynomolgus monkeys, or humans of at least about 5 hours, at least about 10 hours, at least about 24 hours, at least about 3 days, at least about 1 week, or at least about 2 weeks. Methods of increasing (or decreasing) the half-life of agents such as polypeptides and antibodies are known in the art. For example, known methods of increasing the circulating half-life of IgG antibodies include the introduction of mutations in the Fc region which increase the pH-dependent binding of the antibody to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) at pH 6.0 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0276799, 2007/0148164, and 2007/0122403). Known methods of increasing the circulating half-life of antibody fragments lacking the Fc region include such techniques as PEGylation.      [0164] In some embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents are polyclonal antibodies.      Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared by any known method. In some embodiments, polyclonal antibodies are raised by immunizing an animal (e.g., a rabbit, rat, mouse, goat, donkey) by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of the relevant antigen (e.g., a purified peptide fragment, full-length recombinant protein, or fusion protein). The antigen can be optionally conjugated to a carrier such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or serum albumin. The antigen (with or without a carrier protein) is diluted in sterile saline and usually combined with an adjuvant (e.g., Complete or Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant) to form a stable emulsion. After a sufficient period of time, polyclonal antibodies are recovered from blood, ascites, and the like, of the immunized animal. The polyclonal antibodies can be purified from serum or ascites according to standard methods in the art including, but not limited to, affinity chromatography, ion- exchange chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and dialysis.      [0165] In some embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents are monoclonal antibodies.      Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma methods known to one of skill in the art (see e.g., Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature, 256:495-497). In some embodiments, using the hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is immunized as described above to elicit from lymphocytes the production of antibodies that will specifically bind the immunizing antigen. In some embodiments, lymphocytes can be immunized in vitro. In some embodiments, the immunizing antigen can be a human protein or a portion thereof. In some embodiments, the immunizing antigen can be a mouse protein or a portion thereof.      Following immunization, lymphocytes are isolated and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line using, for example, polyethylene glycol, to form hybridoma cells that can then be selected away from unfused lymphocytes and myeloma cells. Hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies directed specifically against a chosen antigen may be identified by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and in vitro binding assay (e.g., flow cytometry, FACS, ELISA, and radioimmunoassay). The hybridomas can be propagated either in in vitro culture using standard methods (J.W. Goding, 1996, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, 3<rd> Edition, Academic Press, San Diego, CA) or in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. The monoclonal antibodies can be purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid according to standard methods in the art including, but not limited to, affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and dialysis.      In certain embodiments, monoclonal antibodies can be made using recombinant DNA techniques as known to one skilled in the art (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567). The polynucleotides encoding a monoclonal antibody are isolated from mature B-cells or hybridoma cells, such as by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers that specifically amplify the genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody, and their sequence is determined using conventional techniques. The isolated polynucleotides encoding the heavy and light chains are then cloned into suitable expression vectors which produce the monoclonal antibodies when transfected into host cells such as E. coli, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin proteins. In other embodiments, recombinant monoclonal antibodies, or fragments thereof, can be isolated from phage display libraries expressing CDRs of the desired species (see e.g., McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature, 348:552-554; Clackson et al., 1991, Nature, 352:624-628; and Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol, 222:581-597).      The polynucleotide(s) encoding a monoclonal antibody can further be modified in a number of different manners using recombinant DNA technology to generate alternative antibodies. In some embodiments, the constant domains of the light and heavy chains of, for example, a mouse monoclonal antibody can be substituted for those regions of, for example, a human antibody to generate a chimeric antibody, or for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide to generate a fusion antibody. In some embodiments, the constant regions are truncated or removed to generate the desired antibody fragment of a monoclonal antibody. Site-directed or high-density mutagenesis of the variable region can he used to optimize specificity, affinity, etc. of a monoclonal antibody.      [0169] In some embodiments, the monoclonal antibody against a human RSPO protein is a humanized antibody. Typically, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins in which residues from the CDRs are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, hamster, etc.) that have the desired specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability using methods known to one skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the Pv framework region residues of a human immunoglobulin are replaced with the corresponding residues in an antibody from a non-human species that has the desired specificity, affinity, and/or binding capability. In some embodiments, the humanized antibody can be further modified by the substitution of additional residues either in the Fv framework region and/or within the replaced non-human residues to refine and optimize antibody specificity, affinity, and/or capability. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two or three, variable domain regions containing all, or substantially all, of the CDRs that correspond to the non-human immunoglobulin whereas all, or substantially all, of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. In some embodiments, the humanized antibody can also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. In certain embodiments, such humanized antibodies are used therapeutically because they may reduce antigenicity and KAMA (human anti-mouse antibody) responses when administered to a human subject. One skilled in the art would be able to obtain a functional humanized antibody with reduced immunogenicity following known techniques (see e.g., U.S. Patent Nos, 5,225,539; 5,585,089; 5,693,761; and 5,693,762).      [0170] in certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent is a human antibody. Human antibodies can be directly prepared using various techniques known in the art. In some embodiments, immortalized human B lymphocytes immunized in vitro or isolated from an immunized individual, that produces an antibody directed against a target antigen can be generated (see, e.g., Cole et aL, 1985, Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy Alan R. Liss, p. 77; Boemer et al., 1991 , J Immunol, 147:86-95; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,750,373; 5,567,610 and 5,229,275). In some embodiments, the human antibody can be selected from a phage library, where that phage library expresses human antibodies (Vaughan et al, 1996, Nature Biotechnology, 14:309-314; Sheets et al., 1998, PNAS, 95:6157-6162; Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J Mol. Biol, 227:381; Marks et al., 1991, J Mol Biol, 222:581). Alternatively, phage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. Techniques for the generation and use of antibody phage libraries are also described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,969,108; 6,172,197; 5,885,793; 6,521,404; 6,544,731 ; 6,555,313; 6,582,915; 6,593,081 ; 6,300,064; 6,653,068; 6,706,484; and 7,264,963; and Rothe et al., 2008, J Mol Bio., 376: 1182-1200. Affinity maturation strategies including, but not limited to, chain shuffling (Marks et al., 1992, Bio/Technology, 10:779-783) and site-directed mutagenesis, are known in the art and may be employed to generate high affinity human antibodies.      [0171] In some embodiments, human antibodies can be made in transgenic mice that contain human immunoglobulin loci. These mice are capable, upon immunization, of producing the full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. This approach is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661 ,016.      [0172] This invention also encompasses bispecific antibodies that specifically recognize at least one human RSPO protein. Bispecific antibodies are capable of specifically recognizing and binding at least two different epitopes. The different epitopes can either be within the same molecule (e.g., two epitopes on human RSPOl) or on different molecules (e.g., one epitope on RSPOl and one epitope on RSP02). In some embodiments, the bispecific antibodies are monoclonal human or humanized antibodies. In some embodiments, the antibodies can specifically recognize and bind a first antigen target, (e.g., RSPOl) as well as a second antigen target, such as an effector molecule on a leukocyte (e.g., CD2, CD3, CD28, or B7) or a Fc receptor (e.g., CD64, CD32, or CD 16) so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the first antigen target. In some embodiments, the antibodies can be used to direct cytotoxic agents to cells which express a particular target antigen. These antibodies possess an antigen-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic agent or a radionuclide chelator, such as EOTUBE, DPTA, DOTA, or TETA. In certain embodiments, the bispecific antibody specifically binds RSPOl, as well as either an additional RSPO protein selected from the group consisting of RSP02, RSP03, and RSP04. In certain embodiments, the bispecific antibody specifically binds RSP02, as well as either an additional RSPO protein selected from the group consisting of RSPOl, RSP03, and RSP04.      [0173] Techniques for making bispecific antibodies are known by those skilled in the art, see for example, Millstein et al., 1983, Nature, 305:537-539; Brennan et al., 1985, Science, 229:81 ; Suresh et al., 1986, Methods in Enzymol., 121 :120; Traunecker et al., 1991, EMBO J., 10:3655-3659; Shalaby et al., 1992, J Exp. Med., 175:217-225; Kostelny et al., 1992, J Immunol, 148: 1547-1553; Gruber et al., 1994, J Immunol, 152:5368; U.S. Patent No. 5,731,168; and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0123532). Bispecific antibodies can be intact antibodies or antibody fragments. Antibodies with more than two valencies are also contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared (Tutt et al., 1991, J. Immunol., 147:60). Thus, in certain embodiments the antibodies to RSPOl are multispecific.      [0174] In certain embodiments, the antibodies (or other polypeptides) described herein may be monospecific. For example, in certain embodiments, each of the one or more antigen-binding sites that an antibody contains is capable of binding (or binds) a homologous epitope on RSPO proteins. In certain embodiments, an antigen-binding site of a monospecific antibody described herein is capable of binding (or binds), for example, RSPOl and RSP02 (i.e., the same epitope is found on both RSPOl and RSP02 proteins).      [0175] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent is an antibody fragment.      Antibody fragments may have different functions or capabilities than intact antibodies; for example, antibody fragments can have increased tumor penetration. Various techniques are known for the production of antibody fragments including, but not limited to, proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies. In some embodiments, antibody fragments include a F(ab')2 fragment produced by pepsin digestion of an antibody molecule. In some embodiments, antibody fragments include a Fab fragment generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of an F(ab')2 fragment. In other embodiments, antibody fragments include a Fab fragment generated by the treatment of the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent. In certain embodiments, antibody fragments are produced recombinantly. In some embodiments, antibody fragments include Fv or single chain Fv (scFv) fragments. Fab, Fv, and scFv antibody fragments can be expressed in and secreted from E. coli or other host cells, allowing for the production of large amounts of these fragments. In some embodiments, antibody fragments are isolated from antibody phage libraries as discussed herein. For example, methods can be used for the construction of Fab expression libraries (Huse et al, 1989, Science, 246:1275-1281) to allow rapid and effective identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity for a RSPO protein or derivatives, fragments, analogs or homologs thereof. In some embodiments, antibody fragments are linear antibody fragments. In certain embodiments, antibody fragments are monospecific or bispecific. In certain embodiments, the RSPO- binding agent is a scFv. Various techniques can be used for the production of single- chain antibodies specific to one or more human RSPOs (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778).      [0176] It can further be desirable, especially in the case of antibody fragments, to modify an antibody in order to increase its serum half-life. This can be achieved, for example, by incorporation of a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody fragment by mutation of the appropriate region in the antibody fragment or by incorporating the epitope into a peptide tag that is then fused to the antibody fragment at either end or in the middle (e.g., by DNA or peptide synthesis),      [0177] Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention.      Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalent!y joined antibodies. Such antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980). It is also contemplated that the heteroconjugate antibodies can be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, immunotoxins can be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate.      [0178] For the purposes of the present invention, it should be appreciated that modified antibodies can comprise any type of variable region that provides for the association of the antibody with the target (i.e., a human RSPOl or human RSP02). In this regard, the variable region may comprise or be derived from any type of mammal that can be induced to mount a humoral response and generate immunoglobulins against the desired tumor associated antigen. As such, the variable region of the modified antibodies can be*for example, of human, murine, non-human primate (e.g. cynomolgus monkeys, macaques, etc.) or rabbit origin. In some embodiments, both the variable and constant regions of the modified immunoglobulins are human. In other embodiments, the variable regions of compatible antibodies (usually derived from a non-human source) can be engineered or specifically tailored to improve the binding properties or reduce the immunogenicity of the molecule. In this respect, variable regions useful in the present invention can be humanized or otherwise altered through the inclusion of imported amino acid sequences.      [0179] In certain embodiments, the variable domains in both the heavy and light chains are altered by at least partial replacement of one or more CDRs and, if necessary, by partial framework region replacement and sequence modification and/or alteration. Although the CDRs may be derived from an antibody of the same class or even subclass as the antibody from which the framework regions are derived, it is envisaged that the CDRs will be derived from an antibody of different class and preferably from an antibody from a different species. It may not be necessary to replace all of the CDRs with all of the CDRs from the donor variable region to transfer the antigen binding capacity of one variable domain to another. Rather, it may only be necessary to transfer those residues that are necessary to maintain the activity of the antigen-binding site. Given the explanations set forth in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,585,089, 5,693,761 and 5,693,762, it will be well within the competence of those skilled in the art, either by carrying out routine experimentation or by trial and error testing to obtain a functional antibody with reduced immunogenicity.      [0180] Alterations to the variable region notwithstanding, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the modified antibodies of this invention will comprise antibodies (e.g., full-length antibodies or immunoreactive fragments thereof) in which at least a fraction of one or more of the constant region domains has been deleted or otherwise altered so as to provide desired biochemical characteristics such as increased tumor localization or increased serum half-life when compared with an antibody of approximately the same immunogenicity comprising a native or unaltered constant region. In some embodiments, the constant region of the modified antibodies will comprise a human constant region. Modifications to the constant region compatible with this invention comprise additions, deletions or substitutions of one or more amino acids in one or more domains. The modified antibodies disclosed herein may comprise alterations or modifications to one or more of the three heavy chain constant domains (CHI, CH2 or CH3) and/or to the light chain constant domain (CL). In some embodiments, one or more domains are partially or entirely deleted from the constant regions of the modified antibodies. In some embodiments, the modified antibodies will comprise domain deleted constructs or variants wherein the entire CH2 domain has been removed (ACH2 constructs). In some embodiments, the omitted constant region domain is replaced by a short amino acid spacer (e.g., 10 amino acid residues) that provides some of the molecular flexibility typically imparted by the absent constant region.      [0181] In some embodiments, the modified antibodies are engineered to fuse the CH3 domain directly to the hinge region of the antibody. In other embodiments, a peptide spacer is inserted between the hinge region and the modified CH2 and/or CH3 domains. For example, constructs may be expressed wherein the CH2 domain has been deleted and the remaining CH3 domain (modified or unmodified) is joined to the hinge region with a 5-20 amino acid spacer. Such a spacer may be added to ensure that the regulatory elements of the constant domain remain free and accessible or that the hinge region remains flexible. However, it should be noted that amino acid spacers may, in some cases, prove to be immunogenic and elicit an unwanted immune response against the construct. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, any spacer added to the construct will be relatively non-immunogenic so as to maintain the desired biological qualities of the modified antibodies.      [0182] In some embodiments, the modified antibodies may have only a partial deletion of a constant domain or substitution of a few or even a single amino acid. For example, the mutation of a single amino acid in selected areas of the CH2 domain may be enough to substantially reduce Fc binding and thereby increase cancer cell localization and/or tumor penetration. Similarly, it may be desirable to simply delete the part of one or more constant region domains that control a specific effector function (e.g. complement Clq binding) to be modulated. Such partial deletions of the constant regions may improve selected characteristics of the antibody (serum half-life) while leaving other desirable functions associated with the subject constant region domain intact. Moreover, as alluded to above, the constant regions of the disclosed antibodies may be modified through the mutation or substitution of one or more amino acids that enhances the profile of the resulting construct. In this respect it may be possible to disrupt the activity provided by a conserved binding site (e.g., Fc binding) while substantially maintaining the configuration and immunogenic profile of the modified antibody. In certain embodiments, the modified antibodies comprise the addition of one or more amino acids to the constant region to enhance desirable characteristics such as decreasing or increasing effector function or provide for more cytotoxin or carbohydrate attachment sites.      [0183] It is known in the art that the constant region mediates several effector functions.      For example, binding of the CI component of complement to the Fc region of IgG or IgM antibodies (bound to antigen) activates the complement system. Activation of complement is important in the opsonization and lysis of cell pathogens. The activation of complement also stimulates the inflammatory response and can also be involved in autoimmune hypersensitivity. In addition, the Fc region of an antibody can bind a cell expressing a Fc receptor (FcR). There are a number of Fc receptors which are specific for different classes of antibody, including IgG (gamma receptors), IgE (epsilon receptors), IgA (alpha receptors) and IgM (mu receptors). Binding of antibody to Fc receptors on cell surfaces triggers a number of important and diverse biological responses including engulfment and destruction of antibody-coated particles, clearance of immune complexes, lysis of antibody-coated target cells by killer cells (called antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or ADCC), release of inflammatory mediators, placental transfer, and control of immunoglobulin production.      [0184] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding antibodies provide for altered effector functions that, in turn, affect the biological profile of the administered antibody. For example, in some embodiments, the deletion or inactivation (through point mutations or other means) of a constant region domain may reduce Fc receptor binding of the circulating modified antibody (e.g., anti-RSPOl antibody) thereby increasing cancer cell localization and/or tumor penetration. In other embodiments, the constant region modifications increase or reduce the serum half-life of the antibody. In some embodiments, the constant region is modified to eliminate disulfide linkages or oligosaccharide moieties. Modifications to the constant region in accordance with this invention may easily be made using well known biochemical or molecular engineering techniques well within the purview of the skilled artisan. [0185] In certain embodiments, a RSPO-binding agent that is an antibody does not have one or more effector functions. For instance, in some embodiments, the antibody has no ADCC activity, and/or no complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity. In certain embodiments, the antibody does not bind an Fc receptor, and/or complement factors. In certain embodiments, the antibody has no effector function.      [0186] The present invention further embraces variants and equivalents which are substantially homologous to the chimeric, humanized, and human antibodies, or antibody fragments thereof, set forth herein. These can contain, for example, conservative substitution mutations, i.e. the substitution of one or more amino acids by similar amino acids. For example, conservative substitution refers to the substitution of an amino acid with another within the same general class such as, for example, one acidic amino acid with another acidic amino acid, one basic amino acid with another basic amino acid or one neutral amino acid by another neutral amino acid. What is intended by a conservative amino acid substitution is well known in the art and described herein.

[0194] In certain embodiments, the antibodies described herein are isolated. In certain embodiments, the antibodies described herein are substantially pure.      [0195] In some embodiments of the present invention, the RSPO-binding agents are polypeptides. The polypeptides can be recombinant polypeptides, natural polypeptides, or synthetic polypeptides comprising an antibody, or fragment thereof, that bind at least one human RSPO protein. It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequences of the invention can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the protein. Thus, the invention further includes variations of the polypeptides which show substantial activity or which include regions of an antibody, or fragment thereof, against a human RSPO protein. In some embodiments, amino acid sequence variations of RSPO-binding polypeptides include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and/or other types of substitutions.      [0196] The polypeptides, analogs and variants thereof, can be further modified to contain additional chemical moieties not normally part of the polypeptide. The derivatized moieties can improve the solubility, the biological half-life, and/or absorption of the polypeptide. The moieties can also reduce or eliminate any undesirable side effects of the polypeptides and variants. An overview for chemical moieties can be found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 2 Edition, 2005, University of the Sciences, Philadelphia, PA.      [0197] The isolated polypeptides described herein can be produced by any suitable method known in the art. Such methods range from direct protein synthesis methods to constructing a DNA sequence encoding polypeptide sequences and expressing those sequences in a suitable host. In some embodiments, a DNA sequence is constructed using recombinant technology by isolating or synthesizing a DNA sequence encoding a wild- type protein of interest. Optionally, the sequence can be mutagenized by site-specific mutagenesis to provide functional analogs thereof. See, e.g., Zoeller et al., 1984, PNAS, 81 :5662-5066 and U.S. Patent No. 4,588,585.      [0198] In some embodiments, a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest may be constructed by chemical synthesis using an oligonucleotide synthesizer. Oligonucleotides can be designed based on the amino acid sequence of the desired polypeptide and selecting those codons that are favored in the host cell in which the recombinant polypeptide of interest will be produced. Standard methods can be applied to synthesize a polynucleotide sequence encoding an isolated polypeptide of interest. For example, a complete amino acid sequence can be used to construct a back-translated gene. Further, a DNA oligomer containing a nucleotide sequence coding for the particular isolated polypeptide can be synthesized. For example, several small oligonucleotides coding for portions of the desired polypeptide can be synthesized and then ligated. The individual oligonucleotides typically contain 5' or 3' overhangs for complementary assembly.      [0199] Once assembled (by synthesis, site-directed mutagenesis, or another method), the polynucleotide sequences encoding a particular polypeptide of interest can be inserted into an expression vector and operatively linked to an expression control sequence appropriate for expression of the protein in a desired host. Proper assembly can be confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, restriction enzyme mapping, and/or expression of a biologically active polypeptide in a suitable host. As is well-known in the art, in order to obtain high expression levels of a transfected gene in a host, the gene must be operatively linked to transcriptional and translational expression control sequences that are functional in the chosen expression host. [0200] In certain embodiments, recombinant expression vectors are used to amplify and express DNA encoding antibodies, or fragments thereof, against a human RSPO protein. For example, recombinant expression vectors can be replicable DNA constructs which have synthetic or cDNA-derived DNA fragments encoding a polypeptide chain of a RSPO-binding agent, an anti-RSPO antibody, or fragment thereof, operatively linked to suitable transcriptional and/or translational regulatory elements derived from mammalian, microbial, viral or insect genes. A transcriptional unit generally comprises an assembly of (1) a genetic element or elements having a regulatory role in gene expression, for example, transcriptional promoters or enhancers, (2) a structural or coding sequence which is transcribed into mRNA and translated into protein, and (3) appropriate transcription and translation initiation and termination sequences. Regulatory elements can include an operator sequence to control transcription. The ability to replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of transformants can additionally be incorporated. DNA regions are ""operatively linked"" when they are functionally related to each other. For example, DNA for a signal peptide (secretory leader) is operatively linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a precursor which participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter is operatively linked to a coding sequence if it controls the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operatively linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to permit translation. In some embodiments, structural elements intended for use in yeast expression systems include a leader sequence enabling extracellular secretion of translated protein by a host cell. In other embodiments, where recombinant protein is expressed without a leader or transport sequence, it can include an N-terminal methionine residue. This residue can optionally be subsequently cleaved from the expressed recombinant protein to provide a final product.      [0201] The choice of an expression control sequence and an expression vector depends upon the choice of host. A wide variety of expression host/vector combinations can be employed. Useful expression vectors for eukaryotic hosts include, for example, vectors comprising expression control sequences from SV40, bovine papilloma virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus. Useful expression vectors for bacterial hosts include known bacterial plasmids, such as plasmids from E. coli, including pCRl, pBR322, pMB9 and their derivatives, and wider host range plasmids, such as Ml 3 and other filamentous single-stranded DNA phages.      [0202] Suitable host cells for expression of a RSPO-binding polypeptide or antibody (or a     RSPO protein to use as an antigen) include prokaryotes, yeast cells, insect cells, or higher eukaryotic cells under the control of appropriate promoters. Prokaryotes include gram- negative or gram-positive organisms, for example E. coli or Bacillus. Higher eukaryotic cells include established cell lines of mammalian origin as described below. Cell-free translation systems may also be employed. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian cellular hosts are described by Pouwels et al. (1985, Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, Elsevier, New York, NY). Additional information regarding methods of protein production, including antibody production, can be found, e.g., in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0187954, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,413,746 and 6,660,501 , and International Patent Publication No. WO 04009823.      [0203] Various mammalian or insect cell culture systems are used to express recombinant polypeptides. Expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells can be preferred because such proteins are generally correctly folded, appropriately modified, and completely functional. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include COS-7 (monkey kidney-derived), L-929 (murine fibroblast-derived), CI 27 (murine mammary tumor-derived), 3T3 (murine fibroblast-derived), CHO (Chinese hamster ovary-derived), HeLa (human cervical cancer-derived), BHK (hamster kidney fibroblast-derived), and HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney-derived) cell lines and variants thereof. Mammalian expression vectors can comprise non-transcribed elements such as an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and enhancer linked to the gene to be expressed, and other 5 Or 3' flanking non-transcribed sequences, and 5' or 3' non-translated sequences, such as necessary ribosome binding sites, a polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, and transcriptional termination sequences. Baculovirus systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells are well-known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Luckow and Summers, 1988, Bio/Technology, 6:47).      [0204] Thus, the present invention provides cells comprising the RSPO-binding agents described herein. In some embodiments, the cells produce the RSPO-binding agents described herein. In certain embodiments, the cells produce an antibody. In certain embodiments, the cells produce antibody 89M5. In certain embodiments, the cells produce antibody h89M5-H2L2. In certain embodiments, the cells produce antibody 130M23. In certain embodiments, the cells produce antibody hl30M23-HlL2. In certain embodiments, the cells produce antibody hl30M23-HlL6. In some embodiments, the cell is a hybridoma cell line having ATCC deposit number PTA- 11970. In some embodiments, the cell is a hybridoma cell line having ATCC deposit number PTA- 12021.      [0205] The proteins produced by a transformed host can be purified according to any suitable method. Standard methods include chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for protein purification. Affinity tags such as hexa-histidine, maltose binding domain, influenza coat sequence, and glutathione-S-transferase can be attached to the protein to allow easy purification by passage over an appropriate affinity column. Isolated proteins can also be physically characterized using such techniques as proteolysis, mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and x-ray crystallography.      [0206] In some embodiments, supernatants from expression systems which secrete recombinant protein into culture media can be first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. Following the concentration step, the concentrate can be applied to a suitable purification matrix. In some embodiments, an anion exchange resin can be employed, for example, a matrix or substrate having pendant diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) groups. The matrices can be acrylamide, agarose, dextran, cellulose, or other types commonly employed in protein purification. In some embodiments, a cation exchange step can be employed. Suitable cation exchangers include various insoluble matrices comprising sulfopropyl or carboxymethyl groups. In some embodiments, a hydroxyapatite media can be employed, including but not limited to, ceramic hydroxyapatite (CHT). In certain embodiments, one or more reverse-phase HPLC steps employing hydrophobic RP-HPLC media, e.g., silica gel having pendant methyl or other aliphatic groups, can be employed to further purify a RSPO-binding agent. Some or all of the foregoing purification steps, in various combinations, can also be employed to provide a homogeneous recombinant protein.      [0207] In some embodiments, recombinant protein produced in bacterial culture can be isolated, for example, by initial extraction from cell pellets, followed by one or more concentration, salting-out, aqueous ion exchange, or size exclusion chromatography steps. HPLC can be employed for final purification steps. Microbial cells employed in expression of a recombinant protein can be disrupted by any convenient method, including freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or use of cell lysing agents.      [0208] Methods known in the art for purifying antibodies and other proteins also include, for example, those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0312425, 2008/0177048, and 2009/0187005.      [0209] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent is a polypeptide that is not an antibody. A variety of methods for identifying and producing non-antibody polypeptides that bind with high affinity to a protein target are known in the art. See, e.g., Skerra, 2007, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol, 18:295-304; Hosse et al., 2006, Protein Science, 15:14-27; Gill et al., 2006, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol, 17:653-658; Nygren, 2008, FEBS J., 275:2668- 76; and Skerra, 2008, FEBS J, 275:2677-83. In certain embodiments, phage display technology may be used to produce and/or identify a RSPO-binding polypeptide. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a protein scaffold of a type selected from the group consisting of protein A, protein G, a lipocalin, a fibronectin domain, an ankyrin consensus repeat domain, and thioredoxin.      [0210] In certain embodiments, the RSPO-binding agents or antibodies can be used in any one of a number of conjugated (i.e. an immunoconjugate or radioconjugate) or non- conjugated forms. In certain embodiments, the antibodies can be used in a non- conjugated form to harness the subject's natural defense mechanisms including complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody dependent cellular toxicity to eliminate the malignant or cancer cells.      [0211] In some embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody or polypeptide) is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent. In some embodiments, the cytotoxic agent is a chemotherapeutic agent including, but not limited to, methotrexate, adriamicin, doxorubicin, melphalan, mitomycin C, chlorambucil, daunorubicin or other intercalating agents. In some embodiments, the cytotoxic agent is an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof, including, but not limited to, diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain, ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), Momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, Sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. In some embodiments, the cytotoxic agent is a radioisotope to produce a radioconjugate or a radioconjugated antibody. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies including, but not limited to, <90>Y, <125>I, <131>I, <123>I, <l u>In, <131>In, <105>Rh, <153>Sm, <67>Cu, 6<7>Ga, <166>Ho, <177>Lu, <186>Re, <188>Re and <212>Bi. Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins, such as a calicheamicin, maytansinoids, a trichothene, and CC1065, and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity, can also be used. Conjugates of an antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyidithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis(p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine), bis- diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1 ,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene).      III. Polynucleotides      [0212] In certain embodiments, the invention encompasses polynucleotides comprising polynucleotides that encode a polypeptide that specifically binds at least one human RSPO or a fragment of such a polypeptide. The term ""polynucleotides that encode a polypeptide"" encompasses a polynucleotide which includes only coding sequences for the polypeptide as well as a polynucleotide which includes additional coding and/or non- coding sequences. For example, the invention provides a polynucleotide comprising a polynucleotide sequence that encodes an antibody to a human RSPO protein or encodes a fragment of such an antibody. The polynucleotides of the invention can be in the form of RNA or in the form of DNA. DNA includes cDNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic DNA; and can be double-stranded or single-stranded, and if single stranded can be the coding strand or non-coding (anti-sense) strand.      [0213] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO:l l , SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:22, SEQ ID NO:25, SEQ ID NO:26, SEQ ID NO:53, SEQ ID NO:55, SEQ ID NO:57, SEQ ID NO:59, SEQ ID NO:68, and SEQ ID NO:69.

In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide comprising polynucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO:72. In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising SEQ ID NO:68 and/or SEQ ID NO:69. In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising SEQ ID NO:70 and/or SEQ ID NO:71. In some embodiments, a plasmid comprises a polynucleotide that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising SEQ ID NO:70 and/or SEQ ID NO:74.      [0215] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 80% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 90% identical, at least 95% identical, and in some embodiments, at least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a polynucleotide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:52, SEQ ID NO:54, SEQ ID NO:56, and SEQ ID NO:58. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 80% identical, at least 85% identical, at least 90% identical, at least 95% identical, and in some embodiments, at least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a polynucleotide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:35, SEQ ID NO:36, SEQ ID NO:39, SEQ ID NO:40, SEQ ID NO:60, SEQ ID NO:62, SEQ ID NO:64, SEQ ID NO:66, SEQ ID NO:72, and SEQ ID NO:75. Also provided is a polynucleotide that comprises a polynucleotide that hybridizes to SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:24, SEQ ID NO:52, SEQ ID NO:54, SEQ ID NO:56, and SEQ ID NO:58, SEQ ID NO:35, SEQ ID NO:36, SEQ ID NO:39, SEQ ID NO:40, SEQ ID NO:60, SEQ ID NO:62, SEQ ID NO:64, SEQ ID NO:66, SEQ ID NO:72, or SEQ ID NO:75. In certain embodiments, the hybridization is under conditions of high stringency.      [0216] In some embodiments, an antibody is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising     SEQ ID NO:23 and SEQ ID NO:24. In some embodiments, an antibody is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising SEQ ID NO:52 and SEQ ID NO:56. In some embodiments, an antibody is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising SEQ ID NO:39 and SEQ ID NO:40. In some embodiments, an antibody is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising SEQ ID NO:60 and SEQ ID NO:64. In some embodiments, an antibody is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising SEQ ID NO:60 and SEQ ID NO:72.      [0217] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides comprise the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide fused in the same reading frame to a polynucleotide which aids, for example, in expression and secretion of a polypeptide from a host cell (e.g., a leader sequence or signal sequence which functions as a secretory sequence for controlling transport of a polypeptide from the cell). The polypeptide having a leader sequence is a preprotein and can have the leader sequence cleaved by the host cell to form the mature form of the polypeptide. The polynucleotides can also encode for a proprotein which is the mature protein plus additional 5' amino acid residues. A mature protein having a prosequence is a proprotein and is an inactive form of the protein. Once the prosequence is cleaved an active mature protein remains.      [0218] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides comprise the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide fused in the same reading frame to a marker sequence that allows, for example, for purification of the encoded polypeptide. For example, the marker sequence can be a hexa-histidine tag supplied by a pQE-9 vector to provide for purification of the mature polypeptide fused to the marker in the case of a bacterial host, or the marker sequence can be a hemagglutinin (HA) tag derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein when a mammalian host (e.g., COS-7 cells) is used. In some embodiments, the marker sequence is a FL AG-tag, a peptide of sequence DYKDDDDK (SEQ ID NO: 18) which can be used in conjunction with other affinity tags.      [0219] The present invention further relates to variants of the hereinabove described polynucleotides encoding, for example, fragments, analogs, and/or derivatives.      [0220] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides polynucleotides comprising polynucleotides having a nucleotide sequence at least about 80% identical, at least about 85% identical, at least about 90% identical, at least about 95% identical, and in some embodiments, at least about 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide comprising a RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody), or fragment thereof, described herein.      [0221] As used herein, the phrase a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95% ""identical"" to a reference nucleotide sequence is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence can include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence. In other words, to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence can be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence can be inserted into the reference sequence. These mutations of the reference sequence can occur at the 5' or 3' terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.      [0222] The polynucleotide variants can contain alterations in the coding regions, non- coding regions, or both. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide variants contain alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide. In some embodiments, nucleotide variants are produced by silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. In some embodiments, nucleotide variants comprise nucleotide sequences which result in expression differences (e.g., increased or decreased expression), even though the amino acid sequence is not changed. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, for example, to optimize codon expression for a particular host (i.e., change codons in the human mR A to those preferred by a bacterial host such as E. coli).      [0223] In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides are isolated. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides are substantially pure.      [0224] Vectors and cells comprising the polynucleotides described herein are also provided. In some embodiments, an expression vector comprises a polynucleotide molecule. In some embodiments, a host cell comprises an expression vector comprising the polynucleotide molecule. In some embodiments, a host cell comprises a polynucleotide molecule.      IV.

[0260] Combination therapy with two or more therapeutic agents often uses agents that work by different mechanisms of action, although this is not required. Combination therapy using agents with different mechanisms of action may result in additive or synergetic effects. Combination therapy may allow for a lower dose of each agent than is used in monotherapy, thereby reducing toxic side effects and/or increasing the therapeutic index of the agent(s). Combination therapy may decrease the likelihood that resistant cancer cells will develop. In some embodiments, combination therapy comprises a therapeutic agent that affects (e.g., inhibits or kills) non-tumorigenic cells and a therapeutic agent that affects (e.g., inhibits or kills) tumorigenic CSCs.      [0261] In some embodiments, the combination of a RSPO-binding agent and at least one additional therapeutic agent results in additive or synergistic results. In some embodiments, the combination therapy results in an increase in the therapeutic index of the RSPO-binding agent. In some embodiments, the combination therapy results in an increase in the therapeutic index of the additional agent(s). In some embodiments, the combination therapy results in a decrease in the toxicity and/or side effects of the RSPO- binding agent.

[0273] In certain embodiments, the treatment involves the administration of a RSPO- binding agent (e.g. an antibody) of the present invention in combination with radiation therapy. Treatment with a RSPO-binding agent can occur prior to, concurrently with, or subsequent to administration of radiation therapy. Dosing schedules for such radiation therapy can be determined by the skilled medical practitioner.      [0274] Combined administration can include co-administration, either in a single pharmaceutical formulation or using separate formulations, or consecutive administration in either order but generally within a time period such that all active agents can exert their biological activities simultaneously. [0275] It will be appreciated that the combination of a RSPO-binding agent and at least one additional therapeutic agent may be administered in any order or concurrently. In some embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent will be administered to patients that have previously undergone treatment with a second therapeutic agent. In certain other embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent and a second therapeutic agent will be administered substantially simultaneously or concurrently. For example, a subject may be given a RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody) while undergoing a course of treatment with a second therapeutic agent (e.g., chemotherapy).

It will further be appreciated that the two (or more) agents or treatments may be administered to the subject within a matter of hours or minutes (i.e., substantially simultaneously).      [0276] For the treatment of a disease, the appropriate dosage of an RSPO-binding agent     (e.g., an antibody) of the present invention depends on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the disease, the responsiveness of the disease, whether the RSPO-binding agent or antibody is administered for therapeutic or preventative purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history, and so on, all at the discretion of the treating physician. The RSPO-binding agent or antibody can be administered one time or over a series of treatments lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved (e.g., reduction in tumor size). Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient and will vary depending on the relative potency of an individual antibody or agent. The administering physician can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies, and repetition rates. In certain embodiments, dosage is from 0.0 ^g to lOOmg/kg of body weight, from O.^g to lOOmg/kg of body weight, from ^g to lOOmg/kg of body weight, from Img to lOOmg/kg of body weight, Img to 80mg/kg of body weight from lOmg to lOOmg/kg of body weight, from lOmg to 75mg/kg of body weight, or from lOmg to 50mg/kg of body weight. In certain embodiments, the dosage of the antibody or other RSPO-binding agent is from about 0.1 mg to about 20mg/kg of body weight. In certain embodiments, dosage can be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. In certain embodiments, the antibody or other RSPO-binding agent is given once every week, once every two weeks or once every three weeks.      [0277] In some embodiments, a RSPO-binding agent (e.g., an antibody) may be administered at an initial higher ""loading"" dose, followed by one or more lower doses. In some embodiments, the frequency of administration may also change. In some embodiments, a dosing regimen may comprise administering an initial dose, followed by additional doses (or ""maintenance"" doses) once a week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, or once every month. For example, a dosing regimen may comprise administering an initial loading dose, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of, for example, one-half of the initial dose. Or a dosing regimen may comprise administering an initial loading dose, followed by maintenance doses of, for example one-half of the initial dose every other week. Or a dosing regimen may comprise administering three initial doses for 3 weeks, followed by maintenance doses of, for example, the same amount every other week.      [0278] As is known to those of skill in the art, administration of any therapeutic agent may lead to side effects and/or toxicities. In some cases, the side effects and/or toxicities are so severe as to preclude administration of the particular agent at a therapeutically effective dose. In some cases, drug therapy must be discontinued, and other agents may be tried. However, many agents in the same therapeutic class often display similar side effects and/or toxicities, meaning that the patient either has to stop therapy, or if possible, suffer from the unpleasant side effects associated with the therapeutic agent.      [0279] Thus, the present invention provides methods of treating cancer in a subject comprising using an intermittent dosing strategy for administering one or more agents, which may reduce side effects and/or toxicities associated with administration of a RSPO- binding agent, chemotherapeutic agent, etc. In some embodiments, a method for treating cancer in a human subject comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective dose of a RSPO-binding agent in combination with a therapeutically effective dose of a chemotherapeutic agent, wherein one or both of the agents are administered according to an intermittent dosing strategy. In some embodiments, the intermittent dosing strategy comprises administering an initial dose of a RSPO-binding agent to the subject, and administering subsequent doses of the RSPO-binding agent about once every 2 weeks. In some embodiments, the intermittent dosing strategy comprises administering an initial dose of a RSPO-binding agent to the subject, and administering subsequent doses of the RSPO-binding agent about once every 3 weeks. In some embodiments, the intermittent dosing strategy comprises administering an initial dose of a RSPO-binding agent to the subject, and administering subsequent doses of the RSPO-binding agent about once every 4 weeks. In some embodiments, the RSPO-binding agent is administered using an intermittent dosing strategy and the chemotherapeutic agent is administered weekly.      V.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both to materials and methods, may be practiced without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. EXAMPLES      Example 1      Expression of RSPO and LGR in human tumors      [0283] mRNA from normal tissue, benign tumor and malignant tumor samples of a large number of human patients was analyzed by microarray analysis (Genelogic BioExpress Datasuite). This data revealed elevated expression levels of RSPO 1 in malignant tissue relative to normal tissue in several tumor types including kidney, endometrial, and ovarian. RSPOl was noted to be frequently over-expressed in ovarian cancer (Fig. 1A). In addition, this data suggested elevated expression levels of RSP03 in malignant tissue relative to normal tissue in several tumor types including ovarian, pancreas, and lung (Fig. 1C). In addition, it was found that LGR5 and LGR6 were over-expressed in malignant breast tumors, colon tumors, lung tumors, and ovarian tumors relative to normal tissue, while LGR4 was over-expressed in lung tumors. LGR5 and LGR6 over- expression appeared to be restricted to triple-negative (ER<neg>PR<ne8>HER2<neg>) breast tumors relative to other breast tumor subtypes.      [0284] RNA was isolated from a series of human tumors grown in murine xenografts.      The RNA samples were prepared and processed using established Affymetrix protocols for the generation of labeled cRNA. The processed RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as outlined in the manufacturer's technical manuals. After hybridization, the microarrays were washed, scanned, and analyzed. Scanned array background adjustment and signal intensity normalization were performed using the GCRMA algorithm (Bioconductor, www.bioconductor.org).      [0285] Particular human RSPOs and human LGRs were evaluated - RSPOl (241450_at),     RSP02 (1554012_at), RSP03 (228186_s_at), RSP04 (237423_at), LGR4 (218326_s_at), LGR5 (210393_at) and LGR6 (227819_at). Microarray analysis showed that, while LGR4 and LGR6 were broadly expressed in almost all tumors, many tumors were found to greatly over-express only particular RSPO family members and LGR5 (Table 2), although these expression levels were not compared to expression levels in normal tissue. Generally there is only a single RSPO family member that is highly expressed in a given tumor, suggesting that there may be functional redundancy within the RSPO family.

RSPO-Fc constructs were generated using standard recombinant DNA techniques. Specifically, full-length human RSPOl, RSP02, RSP03 and RSP04 were ligated in-frame to a human Fc region and the recombinant RSPO-Fc proteins were expressed in insect cells using baculovirus. The fusion proteins were purified from the insect medium using protein A chromatography.      [0287] HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG-LGR5-CD4TM-GFP construct. After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of l(^g/ml RSPOl-Fc, RSP02-Fc, RSP03-FC, RSP04-Fc, or FZD8-Fc fusion proteins for 15 minutes. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by the Fc fusion proteins. Cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a positive control and with an anti-PE antibody as a negative control. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0288] As shown in Figure 2, RSPOl, RSP02, RSP03 and RSP04 all bound to LGR5 expressed on the surface of the HEK-293 cells, while FZD8, the negative control, did not bind LGR5.      [0289] Binding affinities between RSPO proteins and LGR5 were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. A soluble LGR5-Fc construct was generated using standard recombinant DNA techniques. Specifically, amino acids 1-564 of human LGR5 were ligated in frame to human Fc and the recombinant LGR5-Fc fusion protein was expressed in insect cells using baculovirus. The LGR5-Fc fusion protein was purified from the insect medium using protein A chromatography. Cleavage of the LGR5 signal sequence results in a mature LGR5-Fc fusion protein containing amino acids 22-564 of LGR5. Recombinant RSPOl-Fc, RSP02-Fc, RSP03-Fc and RSP04-Fc fusion proteins were immobilized on CM5 chips using standard amine-based chemistry (NHS/EDC), Two-fold dilutions of soluble LGR5-Fc were injected over the chip surface ( to 0.78nM). Kinetic data were collected over time using a Biacore 2000 system from Biacore Life Sciences (GE Healthcare) and the data were fit using the simultaneous global fit equation to yield affinity constants (KD values) for each RSPO protein (Table 3).      Table 3      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""115441282-imgf000113_0001"" />    [0290] Human RSPOl, RSP02, RSP03 and RSP04 all bound to LGR5, demonstrating that RSPO proteins may be ligands for LGR proteins.      Example 3      In vitro testing for inhibition of -catenin signaling      [0291] To prepare cell suspensions, fresh human lung adenocarcinoma xenograft tumors     (lung tumor #1 in Table 2) propagated in NOD/SCID mice were minced and digested in medium 199 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 300U/ml collagenase type 3 (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) and 200U/ml DNase I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) for 1 to 2 hours at 37C. The lung tumor cells were filtered through a 40  nylon strainer (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and spun down at 82 x g for 5 minutes. Red blood cells were lysed in ACK buffer (0.8% ammonium chloride, 0.1 mM EDTA, lOmM sodium bicarbonate, 0.1N HC1), washed, and centrifuged at 150 xg for 5 minutes in medium consisting of HBSS (Mediatech, Manassas, VA), 25mM HEPES buffer (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) and 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Dead cells and debris were removed by centrifugation on a cushion of HI-FBS at 82 x g for 8 minutes. Mouse stroma cells were depleted using 501 MagnaBind streptavidin beads (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) per 10<6> cells/ml after staining with 5,ug/ml biotin-conjugated anti~H~2Kd and 2.5  anti-mouse CD45 monoclonal antibodies (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) in SM,      [0292] To produce conditioned medium, me lung tumor cells were cultured in     DME :F12 (3:1) medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with B27 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), insuiin-transferrin-selenium (Invitrogen. Carlsbad, CA), penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), ().5/1 hydrocortisone (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), 20ng/ml EOF (MBL International, Woburn, MA), 20ng/ml basic FGF (MBL International, Wobum, MA) and 5U/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After 24 hours the conditioned medium was harvested (referred to herein as ""LT"").      [0293] STF-293 cells are stably transfected with a 6xTCF-luciferase reporter vector. One volume of lung tumor cell-conditioned medium (LT) or control medium was added to STF-293 cells in the presence of purified soluble LGR5-Fc, FZD8-Fc, Jag-Fc fusion proteins (lC^g/ml), an anti-FZD monoclonal antibody (4(^g/ml), or antibody LZ1 (4(^g/ml). In addition, Wnt3a L-cell-conditioned medium was used as a positive control and was tested in combination with the lung tumor cell-conditioned medium (LT) at a final dilution of 1 :4. The cells were incubated for 16 hours and luciferase activity was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).      [0294] The effect of purified soluble LGR5-Fc and FZD8-Fc fusion proteins was compared to the control Jagl-Fc protein, and the effect of the anti-FZD monoclonal antibody was compared to the control anti -bacterial lysozyme antibody LZ1. As shown in Figure 3 (left side), the lung tumor cell-conditioned medium (LT) contains an activity that potentiated the Wnt3a-induced -catenin activity. The protein potentiating the - catenin activity in the LT medium was inhibited by soluble LGR5-Fc which binds to RSPO proteins. This activity was also inhibited by FZD8-Fc and the anti-FZD antibody, agents that block Wnt signaling. Soluble Jag-Fc and LZldid not inhibit the activity. Even in the absence of Wnt3a (Fig. 3, right side), the LT medium induced -catenin signaling. Soluble Jag-Fc and LZldid not inhibit this activity. In contrast, soluble LGR5-Fc inhibited the LT medium-induced -catenin signaling, reducing the response to almost control levels. This data suggested that the lung tumor cells produced a protein (or proteins) with RSPO-like activity, this activity was inhibited by LGR5, and this activity was separate from Wnt3a activity.      [0295] Similar experiments were undertaken using co-culture assays using lung tumor cell-conditioned medium and ovarian tumor cell-conditioned medium. As described above, freshly processed tumor cells depleted of stroma cells were cultured overnight. Culture medium and cells were transferred to STF-293 cells with or without Wnt3a L- cell-conditioned medium. LGR5-Fc fusion protein, a FZD8-Fc fusion protein, or a control Fc fusion protein was added (lC^g/ml). The cells were incubated for 20 hours and luciferase activity was measured as described above.      [0296] As shown in Figure 13, -catenin signaling activity was induced by the tumor cells and supernatants and further enhanced in combination with Wnt3a L-cell- conditioned medium (Fig. 13 A, lung tumor LU2; Fig. 13B, lung tumor LU25; Fig. 13C, ovarian tumor OV38). FZD8-Fc, a Wnt pathway inhibitor, reduced the Wnt3a-induced - catenin activity almost to background levels, while LGR5-Fc strongly reduced the tumor- derived -catenin activity. As above, this data suggested that the lung and ovarian tumor cells produced a protein (or proteins) with RSPO-like activity, that this activity was inhibited by LGR5, and that this activity was separate from Wnt3a activity.      Example 4      In vitro testing for inhibition of SPO activity by soluble LGR5      [0297] Conditioned medium from human lung tumor #1 cells was prepared as described in Example 3 and soluble LGR5-Fc and RSP02-Fc were produced as described in Example 2.      [0298] HEK-293 cells were transfected with a 6xTCF-luciferase reporter vector     (TOPflash, Millipore, Billerica, MA). After 24-48 hrs, the transfected cells were incubated with medium containing 25% lung tumor cell-conditioned medium plus 25% Wnt3a-L cell -conditioned medium or medium containing RSP02 (lOng/ml) plus 25% Wnt3a-L cell-conditioned medium. Soluble LGR5 was added to the cells in 4-fold serially dilutions at 2(^g/ml to O.C^g/ml. Soluble Jag-Fc protein was used as a negative control at 2C^g/ml and FZD8-Fc protein was used as a positive control at 2C^g/ml. The cells were incubated for 16 hours and luciferase activity was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).      [0299] As shown in Figure 4, increasing concentrations of soluble LGR5-Fc reduced the induction of luciferase activity by the combination of RSP02-Fc plus Wnt3a-conditioned medium (--) as well as the induction of luciferase activity by the combination of lung tumor cell-conditioned medium and Wnt3a-conditioned medium (--). Negative control Jag-Fc protein did not block the luciferase activity, while FZD8-Fc, which blocks Wnt3a, blocked the luciferase activity. Importantly, LGR5 displayed the same EC50 for inhibition with both the RSP02 protein and the lung tumor cell-conditioned medium. This data demonstrated that the protein(s) with RSPO-like activity produced by the lung tumor cells was inhibited by LGR5, behaved very similarly to a purified RSPO protein, and suggested that the activity in the lung tumor cell-conditioned media was due to a RSPO protein.      Example 5      Generation of anti-RSPOl monoclonal antibodies      [0300] Antibodies were generated against recombinant human RSPOl protein amino acids 31-263 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Mice (n=3) were immunized with RSPOl protein using standard techniques. Sera from individual mice were screened against RSPOl approximately 70 days after initial immunization using FACS analysis. The animal with the highest antibody titer was selected for final antigen boost after which spleen cells were isolated for hybridoma production. SP2/0 cells were used as fusion partners for the mouse spleen cells. Hybridoma cells were plated at 1 cell per well in 96 well plates, and the supernatants were screened against human RSPOl by FACS analysis.      [0301] For FACS screening of anti-RSPOl antibodies a chimeric fusion protein enabling cell surface expression of the N-terminal furin-like domains of human RSPOl was constructed. As shown in Figure 5 A, the fusion protein contains a N-terminal FLAG tag, followed by the two furin-like domains of RSPOl (aa 34-135) and fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of human CD4 and a C-terminal green fluorescent protein tag (FL AG-RSPO 1 furin-CD4TM-GFP) > [0302] HEK-293 cells were transfected with FLAG-RSP01furin-CD4TM-GFP. After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of 501 of hybridoma supernatants for 30 minutes. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by antibody. Cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a positive control and an anti-PE antibody as a negative control. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0303] Several hybridomas were identified that bound RSPOl, including 89M2, 89M4,     89M5, 89M7, 89M19 and 89M25 (Fig. 5B). The heavy chain and light chain variable regions were sequenced from several of these antibodies. After analysis, it was found that antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, and 89M25 comprised the same heavy and light chain variable regions. The hybridoma cell line expressing antibody 89M5 was deposited with the ATCC, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA, USA, under the conditions of the Budapest Treaty on June 30, 201 1 and assigned ATCC deposit designation number PTA- 1 1970. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of 89M5 are SEQ ID NO: 10 and SEQ ID NO:l l . The nucleotide sequences of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of 89M5 are SEQ ID NO: 19 and SEQ ID NO:20. The heavy and light chain CDRs of 89M5 are listed in Table 1 herein. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chain and light chain of 89M5 are SEQ ID NO:21 and SEQ ID NO:22; the nucleotide sequences of the heavy chain and light chain of 89M5 are SEQ ID NO:23 and SEQ ID NO:24.      Example 6      Identification of anti-RSPOl monoclonal antibodies that inhibit induction of - catenin signaling by RSPOl      [0304] HEK-293 cells were transfected with a 6xTCF-luciferase reporter vector     (TOPflash, Millipore, Billerica, MA). After 24-48 hrs, the transfected HEK-293 cells were incubated with a combination of Wnt3a (5ng/ml) and human RSPOl (l Ong/ml, R&D BioSystems) in the presence of anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, 89M7, 89M19, and 89M25, or 2 irrelevant control antibodies 254M14 and 254M26 (2-fold dilutions at 10g/ml to 0.625g/ml). The cells were incubated for 16 hours and luciferase - i n activity was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).      [0305] As shown in Figure 6, anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5 and 89M25 each blocked signaling, whereas anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M7 and 89M19 did not block signaling. As determined by sequencing of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions, antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5 and 89M25 all comprise the same heavy chain and light chain variable regions and therefore, presumably, the same antigen binding site. These results demonstrated that an anti-RSPOl antibody was able to block RSPOl - induced -catenin signaling.      Example 7      Anti-RSPOl antibodies block binding of soluble RSPOl to LGR5      [0306] HE -293 cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG-LGR5-CD4TM-GFP construct (previously described in Example 2). After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of RSPOl-Fc protein (K^g ml) and antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5, 89M7, 89M19 or 89M25 (lC^g/ml). A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti -human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by the RSPOl-Fc fusion protein. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0307] As shown in Figure 7, anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5 and 89M25 each blocked binding of RSPOl to LGR5, whereas anti-RSPOl antibodies 89M7 and 89M19 did not block binding of RSPOl to LGR5. These results correlate with the results shown in Example 6 which demonstrated the ability of antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5 and 89M25 to block RSPOl signaling in an assay measuring induction of -catenin activity in a 6xTCF luciferase reporter assay, whereas antibodies 89M7 and 89M19 were not able to block RSPOl signaling. As discussed above, antibodies 89M2, 89M4, 89M5 and 89M25 all comprise the same heavy chain and light chain variable regions and presumably the same antigen binding site, therefore it would be expected that these antibodies all function in a similar, if not identical, manner. Example 8      Binding affinities of anti-RSPOl antibodies      [0308] The KDs of antibodies 89M4, 89M5, 89M7 and 89M25 were determined using a     Biacore 2000 system from Biacore LifeSciences (GE Healthcare). Recombinant human RSPOl-Fc or mouse RSPOl-Fc proteins were immobilized on CM5 chips using standard amine-based chemistry (NHS/EDC). The antibodies were serially diluted 2-fold from  to 0.78nM in HBS-P (0.01M HEPES pH7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) and were injected over the chip surface. Kinetic data were collected over time and were fit using the simultaneous global fit equation to yield affinity constants (34 values) for each antibody.      Table 4      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""115441282-imgf000119_0001"" />    [0309] As shown in Table 4, antibodies 89M4, 89M5, 89M7 and 89M25 all had an affinity constants (KD) for human RSPOl of less than 0.1 nM. These antibodies also had KD of less than 0.1 nM for mouse RSPOl.      Example 9      Inhibition of ovarian tumor growth in vivo by anti-RSPOl antibodies      [0310] Dissociated OV19 ovarian tumor cells (1 x 10<5>cells) were injected in the mammary fat pads of 6-8 week old NOD/SCID mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for 45 days until they reached an average volume of 134mm . The mice were randomized (n = 10 per group) and treated with anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5, 89M25, taxol, a combination of 89M5 and taxol, a combination of 89M25 and taxol, or control antibody 1B7.11. Antibodies were dosed at 15mg/kg once a week, and taxol was dosed at 7.5mg/ml once a week. Administration of the antibodies and taxol was performed via injection into the intraperitoneal cavity. Tumor growth was monitored and tumor volumes were measured with electronic calipers at the indicated time points. Data are expressed as mean  S.E.M.      [0311] At day 35, treatment with antibody 89M5 resulted in a 40% reduction in tumor growth and 89M25 resulted in a 25% reduction in tumor growth as compared to treatment with the control antibody (Fig. 8, p = 0.37 and p 0.19, respectively). Treatment with 89M5 or 89M25 in combination with taxol resulted in a reduction of tumor growth greater than treatment with either agent alone. Treatment with 89M5 and taxol resulted in a 48% reduction in growth (p = 0.12 vs. the control group), and treatment with 89M25 and taxol resulted in a 43% reduction in growth (p = 0.16 vs. the control group). Thus, antibodies 89M5 and 89M25 demonstrated anti-tumor growth activity in the OV19 ovarian tumor model as a single agent, and also displayed anti-tumor growth activity in combination with taxol.      [0312] Subsequent analysis of the tumors from the mice used in this experiment (both control and treated mice) revealed that the tumors were a mixture of human ovarian tumor cells (OV19) and murine T-cell lymphoma cells.      Example 10      Epitope mapping of anti-RSPOl monoclonal antibody 89M5      [0313] To further characterize the specific region(s) of RSPOl that antibody 89M5 binds, an epitope mapping experiment was performed. A series of constructs comprising different regions of human RSPOl were generated using standard recombinant DNA technology (see Fig. 9A). The constructs were fusion proteins each containing a N- terminal FLAG tag, followed by a portion of RSPOl protein and fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of human CD4. In some versions the fusion proteins also comprise a C-terminal green fluorescent protein tag.      [0314] HEK-293 cells were transfected with the individual constructs. After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 for 30 minutes. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by antibody. Cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a positive control and an anti-PE antibody as a negative control. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0315] As shown in Figure 9B, the FACS analysis suggests that amino acids within the furin2 domain of RSPOl are involved in the binding site for anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 (Example 10, Fig. 9). These preliminary results do not preclude that fact that amino acids in other RSPOl domains may be involved in the binding site.      Example 11      Generation of anti-RSP02 monoclonal antibodies      [0316] Antibodies were generated against recombinant human RSP02 protein amino acids 22-205 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Mice (n=3) were immunized with RSP02 protein using standard techniques. Sera from individual mice were screened against RSP02 approximately 70 days after initial immunization using FACS analysis. The animal with the highest antibody titer was selected for final antigen boost after which spleen cells were isolated for hybridoma production. SP2/0 cells were used as fusion partners for the mouse spleen cells. Hybridoma cells were plated at 1 cell per well in 96 well plates, and the supernatants were screened against human RSP02 by FACS analysis.      [0317] As described in Example 5, for FACS screening of anti-RSP02 antibodies a chimeric fusion protein enabling cell surface expression of the N-terminal furin-like domains of human RSP02 was constructed. Similar to what is depicted in Figure 5 A for RSPOl , the RSP02 fusion protein contains a N-terminal FLAG tag, followed by the furin-like domains of RSP02 (aa 31-146) and fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of human CD4 and a C-terminal green fluorescent protein tag (FL AG-RSP02furin-CD4TM-GFP) .      [0318] HEK-293 cells were transfected with FLAG-RSP02furin-CD4TM-GFP. After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of 501 of hybridoma supernatants for 30 minutes. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by antibody. Cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a positive control and an anti-PE antibody as a negative control. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0319J Several hybridomas were identified that bound RSP02, including 130M23,     130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 (Fig. 10). The heavy chain and light chain variable regions were sequenced from several of these antibodies. The hybridoma cell line expressing antibody 130M23 was deposited with the ATCC, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA, USA, under the conditions of the Budapest Treaty on August 10, 2011 and assigned ATCC deposit designation number PTA- 12021. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chain variable region and light chain variable region of 130M23 are SEQ ID NO:27 and SEQ ID NO:28. The nucleotide sequences of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions of 130M23 are SEQ ID NO:35 and SEQ ID NO:36. The heavy chain and light chain CDRs of 130M23 are listed in Table 1 herein. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chain and light chain of 130M23 are SEQ ID NO:37 and SEQ ID NO:38; the nucleotide sequences of the heavy chain and light chain of 130M23 are SEQ ID NO:39 and SEQ ID NO:40.      Example 12      Identification of anti-RSP02 monoclonal antibodies that inhibit induction of - catenin signaling by RSP02      [0320] HE -293 cells were transfected with a 6xTCF-luciferase reporter vector     (TOPflash, Millipore, Billerica, MA). After 24-48 hrs, the transfected HEK-293 cells were incubated with a combination of Wnt3a (5ng/ml) and human RSP02 (lOng/ml, R&D BioSystems) or human RSP03 (lOng/ml, R&D BioSystems) in the presence of anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28. Cells were incubated with a combination of Wnt3a and RSPO, Wnt3a only or with no addition as controls. The cells were incubated for 16 hours and luciferase activity was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).      [0321] As shown in Figure 1 1 , anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25,     130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 each reduced RSP02-induced -catenin signaling, and anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23, 130M24 completely blocked RSP02-induced -catenin signaling. In contrast these antibodies did not block -catenin signaling induced by RSP03. These results demonstrated that antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 are specific inhibitors of RSP02 and are capable of reducing and/or completely blocking RSP02-induced -catenin signaling.      Example 13      Anti-RSP02 antibodies block binding of soluble RSP02 to LGR5      [0322] HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with the FLAG-LGR5-CD4TM-GFP construct (previously described in Example 2). After 48 hours, transfected cells were suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of RSP02-Fc protein (l(^g/ml) and antibodies 130M23, 130M24, 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti- human Fc secondary antibody was performed to detect cells bound by the RSP02-Fc fusion protein. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0323] As shown in Figure 12, anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M23 and 130M24 each blocked binding of RSP02 to LGR5, whereas anti-RSP02 antibodies 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 only weakly blocked or did not block binding of RSP02 to LGR5. These results correlate with the results shown in Example 11 which demonstrated the ability of antibodies 130M23 and 130M24 to completely block RSP02-induced -catenin signaling, whereas antibodies 130M25, 130M26, 130M27, and 130M28 were less potent inhibitors of RSP02-induced -catenin signaling.      Example 14      Generation of anti-RSP03 monoclonal antibodies      [0324] Antibodies are generated against recombinant human RSP03 protein amino acids     22-272 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Mice (n=3) are immunized with RSP03 protein using standard techniques. Sera from individual mice are screened against RSP03 approximately 70 days after initial immunization using FACS analysis. The animal with the highest antibody titer is selected for final antigen boost after which spleen cells are isolated for hybridoma production. SP2/0 cells are used as fusion partners for the mouse spleen cells. Hybridoma cells are plated at 1 cell per well in 96 well plates, and the supernatants are screened against human RSP03 by FACS analysis.      [0325] As described in Example 5, for FACS screening of anti-RSP03 antibodies a chimeric fusion protein enabling cell surface expression of the N-terminal furin-like domains of human RSPO was constructed. Similar to what is depicted in Figure 5A for RSPOl, the RSP03 fusion protein contains a N-terminal FLAG tag, followed by the furin-like domains of RSP03 (aa 32-141 ) and fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of human CD4 and a C-terminal green fluorescent protein tag (FLAG-RSP03furin-CD4TM-GFP).      [0326] HEK-293 cells are transfected with FLAG-RSP03furin-CD4TM-GFP. After 48 hours, transfected cells are suspended in ice cold PBS containing 2% FBS and heparin and incubated on ice in the presence of 501 of hybridoma supernatants for 30 minutes. A second incubation with  PE-conjugated anti-human Fc secondary antibody is performed to detect cells bound by antibody. Cells are incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a positive control and an anti-PE antibody as a negative control. The cells are analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data is processed using FlowJo software.      Example 15      Binding affinity of anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23      [0327] The KD of 130M23 was determined using a Biacore 2000 system from Biacore     LifeSciences (GE Healthcare). Recombinant human RSP02-Fc or mouse RSP02-Fc proteins were immobilized on CM5 chips using standard amine-based chemistry (NHS/EDC). The antibodies were serially diluted 2-fold from  to 0.78nM in HBS- P (0.01M HEPES pH7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) and were injected over the chip surface. Kinetic data were collected over time and were fit using the simultaneous global fit equation to yield affinity constants (KD values) for each antibody.      [0328] Antibody 130M23 had an affinity constant (KD) for human RSP02 of 0.14nM and a KD of 0.35nM for mouse RSP02. Example 16      In vitro testing for inhibition of RSPO activity by anti-RSP02 antibody      [0329] Conditioned medium from human lung tumor LU2 cells was prepared as described in Example 3 and soluble LGR5-Fc was produced as described in Example 2.      [0330] STF-293 cells were incubated with LU2 cells plus 25% lung tumor cell- conditioned medium plus 25% Wnt3a-L cell-conditioned medium. Antibody 130M23 and soluble LGR5-Fc were added to the cells in 5-fold serially dilutions from 5C^g/ml to 0.00C^g/ml. An irrelevant monoclonal antibody, similarly diluted, and a control Fc fusion protein (50ug/ml) were used as negative controls. The cells were incubated for 20 hours and luciferase activity was measured using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).      [0331] As shown in Figure 14, increasing concentrations of soluble LGR5-Fc (--) reduced the induction of luciferase activity by the combination of lung tumor cell- conditioned medium and Wnt3a-conditioned medium. Increasing concentrations of anti- RSP02 antibody 130M23 (--) also reduced the induction of luciferase activity by the combination of lung tumor cell-conditioned medium and Wnt3a-conditioned medium. 130M23 blocked conditioned medium induced activity with an IC5o of 129nM and was greater than 100-fold more potent than LGR5-Fc. A control Fc fusion protein (--), as well as an irrelevant antibody (--) did not block the luciferase activity.      Example 17      Inhibition of pancreatic tumor growth in vivo by anti-RSPO antibodies      [0332] Dissociated PN31 pancreatic tumor cells (1 x 10<5>cells) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6-8 week old NOD/SCID mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for 61 days until they reached an average volume of 120mm . The mice were randomized (n = 10 per group) and treated with anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5, anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23, gemcitabine, a combination of 89M5 and gemcitabine, a combination of 130M23 and gemcitabine, or control antibody 1B7.11. Antibodies were dosed at 15mg/kg once a week, and gemcitabine was dosed at 30mg/ml once a week. Administration of the antibodies and gemcitabine was performed via injection into the intraperitoneal cavity. Tumor growth was monitored and tumor volumes were measured with electronic calipers at specific time points. Data are expressed as mean  S.E.M.      [0333] As shown in Figure 15, treatment with anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 or anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 as single agents had only a minimal effect on tumor growth. Treatment with gemcitabine alone reduced tumor growth by 49% as compared to the controls (p = 0.09). However, treatment with 89M5 or 130M23 in combination with gemcitabine resulted in a reduction of tumor growth greater than treatment with either agent alone. Treatment with 89M5 and gemcitabine resulted in a 59% reduction in growth (p = 0.015 vs. the control group), and treatment with 130M23 and gemcitabine resulted in a 58% reduction in growth (p = 0.016 vs. the control group). Thus, anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 and anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 demonstrated strong anti-tumor growth activity in combination with gemcitabine in a pancreatic xenograft model.      Example 18      Inhibition of pancreatic tumor growth in vivo by anti-RSPO antibodies in      combination with Wnt pathway inhibitors      [0334] Dissociated PN7 pancreatic tumor cells (1 10<5>cells) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6-8 week old NOD/SCID mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for 25 days until they reached an average volume of 130mm . The mice were randomized (n 10 per group) and treated with anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23, anti-FZD antibody 18R5, gemcitabine, a combination of 130M23 and gemcitabine, a combination of 18R5 and gemcitabine, a combination of 130M23 and 18R5, a combination of 130M23, 18R5 and gemcitabine, or control antibody 1B7.1 1. Anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 was dosed at lOmg/kg once a week, anti-FZD antibody 18R5 was dosed at 20mg/kg once a week, and gemcitabine was dosed at 30mg/ml once a week. Administration of the antibodies and gemcitabine was performed via injection into the intraperitoneal cavity. Tumor growth was monitored and tumor volumes were measured with electronic calipers at specific time points. Data are expressed as mean  S.E.M. A parallel set of experiments included mice treated with a FZD8-Fc soluble receptor (lOmg/kg) in combination with gemcitabine and FZD8-Fc in combination with 130M23 and gemcitabine. [0335] Treatment with antibody 130M23 or antibody 18R5 as a single agent resulted in approximately 55% reduction in tumor growth as compared to treatment with the control antibody (Fig. 16A, p < 0.001). Treatment with 130M23 or 18R5 in combination with gemcitabine resulted in a reduction of tumor growth greater than treatment with either agent alone. Treatment with 130M23 and gemcitabine resulted in a 68% reduction in growth (p < 0.001 vs. the control group), and treatment with 18R5 and gemcitabine resulted in a 75% reduction in growth (p < 0.001 vs. the control group). Furthermore, a combination of 130M23, gemcitabine and 18R5 resulted in almost complete inhibition of growth of the PN7 tumors (Fig. 16 A). Similar results were seen with a combination of 130M23, gemcitabine and a FZD8-Fc soluble receptor (Fig. 16B). Thus, an anti-RSP02 antibody such as 130M23 has single agent activity in inhibiting pancreatic tumor growth. Furthermore, combination of an anti-RSP02 antibody with gemcitabine, or a combination of an anti-RSP02 antibody with gemcitabine and a Wnt pathway inhibitor such as anti- FZD antibody 18R5 or a FZD8-Fc soluble receptor, was shown to be a very effective therapy for inhibiting tumor growth in a pancreatic tumor model.      [0336] IHC studies showed that the anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 induced morphological changes in the PN7 tumors of treated mice as compared to untreated mice. These cells also displayed a significant decrease in proliferation using an anti-Ki67 antibody. These results possibly reflect a loss in tumor cells and an increase in stroma.      [0337] The PN7 tumors described above were processed to yield single cell suspensions.      Mouse cells were depleted from the cell mixtures using biotinylated anti-H2K<d> and anti- CD45 antibodies and streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. The remaining human tumor cells were serially transplanted into a new cohort of mice. 90 tumor cells from each treatment group were injected into the flanks of NOD-SCID mice (n = 10 mice per group). Tumors were allowed to grow for 40 days with no treatment and tumor volumes were measured with electronic calipers.      [0338] Figure 16C shows the tumor volume from individual mice in each group. Cells isolated from mice treated with anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 or anti-FZD antibody 18R5 as single agents or in a combination had greatly decreased tumorigenicity as compared to cells isolated from mice treated with control antibody. This reduced tumorigenicity was much greater than the decrease in tumorigenicity observed with gemcitabine alone. Cells from mice treated with combinations of gemcitabine and 130M23, gemcitabine and 18R5, or gemcitabine and FZD8-Fc showed tumorigenicity that was only slightly reduced as compared to cell isolated from mice treated with control antibody. Interestingly, cells isolated from mice treated with a combination of 130M23, 18R5 and gemcitabine or 130M23, FZD8-Fc and gemcitabine demonstrated a significant and striking lack of tumor growth, greater than any of the agents alone or in two agent combinations. These results showed that inhibiting multiple pathways in addition to standard chemotherapy has an additive, and possibly a synergistic effect in reducing tumorigenicity and cancer stem cells.      Example 19      Humanization of RSPO antibodies Humanized antibodies against human RSPOl and RSP02 were generated. The heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region of the murine monoclonal antibodies 89M5 and 130M23 were isolated and sequenced from the hybridoma line using degenerate PCR essentially as described in Larrick, J.M., et al., 1989, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 160: 1250 and Jones, S.T. & Bendig, M.M., 1991, Bio/Technology 9: 88. Human heavy and light chain variable framework regions likely to be structurally similar to the parental 89M5 or 130M23 antibody amino acid sequences were then considered as reference human framework regions to help guide the design of novel synthetic frameworks. To identify the human framework regions bearing similarity to murine frameworks, the predicted protein sequences encoded by the murine heavy chain and light chain variable domains of 89M5 and 130M23 were compared with human antibody sequences encoded by expressed human cDNA using BLAST searches for human sequence deposited in Genbank. The amino acid differences between candidate humanized framework heavy chains and the parent murine monoclonal antibody heavy chain variable regions and light chain variable regions were evaluated for likely importance, and a judgment made as to whether each difference in position contributes to proper folding and function of the variable region. This analysis was guided by examination of solved crystal structures of other antibody fragments (e.g., the structure of Fab 2E8 as described in Trakhanov et al, Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr, 1999, 55: 122-28, as well as other protein crystal structures (e.g., protein data bank structures 1ADQ and 1GIG)). Structures were modeled using computer software including Jmol, quick PDB, and Pymol. Consideration was given to the potential impact of an amino acid at a given position on the packing of the -sheet framework, the interaction between the heavy and light chain variable regions, the degree of solvent exposure of the amino acid side chain, and the likelihood that an amino acid would impact the positioning of the CDR loops. From this analysis, candidate heavy chain variable regions fused in-frame to the human IgG2 constant region and candidate light chain variable regions fused in frame with the human Ig Cl constant region were conceived and chemically synthesized. The candidate heavy chains and light chains comprise: i) a synthetic framework designed to resemble natural human frameworks and ii) the parental 89M5 or 130M23 murine antibody CDRs.      [0340] The functionality of each candidate variant humanized heavy chain and light chain was tested by cotransfection into mammalian cells. Each candidate humanized heavy chain described above was cotransfected into HEK-293 cells with the murine light chain cDNA, and conditioned media was assayed by FACS for RSPO binding activity. Humanized 89M5 heavy chain variant ""89M5-H2"" (SEQ ID NO:68) exhibited the most robust binding and was selected. The 89M5-H2 humanized heavy chain was cotransfected into HEK-293 cells with each of the candidate humanized light chains, and conditioned media was again assayed for antigen binding by FACS. Light chain variant ""89M5-L2"" (SEQ ID NO:69) exhibited the most robust binding and was selected. Similarly the humanized 130M23 heavy chain variant ""130M23-H1"" (SEQ ID NO:70) exhibited the most robust binding and was selected. The 130M23-H1 humanized heavy chain was cotransfected into HEK-293 cells with each of the candidate humanized light chains, and conditioned media was again assayed for antigen binding by FACS. Light chain variant ""130M23-L2"" (SEQ ID NO:71) exhibited the most robust binding and was selected.      [0341] To increase antibody production, a variant of 130M23-H1L2 was generated. The variant comprises the same heavy chain as 130M23-H1 L2, but has a modified light chain and is referred to as hl30M23-HlL6. Example 20      Binding affinity of humanized 89M5 and humanized 130M23      [0342] The KD of h89M5-H2L2 was determined using a Biacore 2000 system from     Biacore LifeSciences (GE Healthcare). Recombinant human RSPOl-Fc or mouse RSPOl-Fc proteins were immobilized on CM5 chips using standard amine-based chemistry (NHS/EDC). The antibodies were serially diluted 2-fold from lOOnM to 0.78nM in HBS-P (0.01M HEPES pH7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) and were injected over the chip surface. Kinetic data were collected over time and were fit using the simultaneous global fit equation to yield affinity constants (KD values) for each antibody.      [0343] h89M5-H2L2 had an affinity constant (KD) for human RSPOl and mouse RSPOl of less than 0.1 nM.      [0344] The KD of hl30M23-HlL2 and hl30M23-H!L6 were determined using a Biacore     2000 system from Biacore LifeSciences (GE Healthcare). Recombinant human RSP02- Fc protein was immobilized on CM5 chips using standard amine-based chemistry (NHS/EDC). The antibodies were serially diluted 2-fold from lOOnM to 0.78nM in HBS- P (0.01M HEPES pH7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) and were injected over the chip surface. Kinetic data were collected over time and were fit using the simultaneous global fit equation to yield affinity constants (KD values) for each antibody.      [0345] hl30M23-HlL2 had an affinity constant (KD) for human RSP02 of 0.13nM and hl30M23-HlL6 had an affinity constant (KD) for human RSP02 of 0.15nM.      Example 21      FACS binding of anti-RSPO antibodies      [0346] HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding     FLAG-RSP01furin-CD4TM-GFP. As described in Example 5, FLAG-RSPO 1 furin- CD4TM-GFP is a chimeric fusion protein enabling cell surface expression of the N- terminal furin-like domains of human RSPOl . FLAG-RSPO lfurin-CD4TM-GFP transfected cells were incubated in the presence of anti-RSPO 1 antibody 89M5 or humanized anti-RSPO 1 antibody h89M5-H2L2. Five-fold serial dilutions of each antibody were examined for their ability to bind to the RSPOl expressing cells. The cells were stained with Phycoerythrin conjugated anti-IgG to reveal bound antibody. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0347] As shown in Figure 17A, these studies indicate that both anti-RSPOl antibody     89M5 and humanized anti-RSPOl antibody h89M5-H2L2 bind to human RSPOl .      [0348] HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding     FLAG-RSP02furin-CD4TM-GFP. As described in Example 11, FLAG-RSP02furin- CD4TM-GFP is a chimeric fusion protein enabling cell surface expression of the N- terminal furin-like domains of human RSP02. FLAG-RSP02furin-CD4TM-GFP transfected cells were incubated in the presence of anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23 or humanized anti-RSP02 antibody hl30M5-HlL2. Five-fold serial dilutions of each antibody were examined for their ability to bind to the RSP02 expressing cells. The cells were stained with Phycoerythrin conjugated anti-IgG to reveal bound antibody. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and the data was processed using FlowJo software.      [0349] As shown in Figure 17B, these studies indicate that both anti-RSP02 antibody     130M23 and humanized anti-RSP02 antibody hl 30M23-HlL2 bind to human RSP02.      Example 22      Inhibition of breast tumor growth in vivo by anti-RSPO antibodies in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent      [0350] Dissociated OMP-B39 breast tumor cells (4 x 10<5>cells) were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of 6-8 week old NOD/SCID mice. OMP-039 is a triple negative breast cancer tumor with a high level of RSP02 expression. In addition, the level of RSPOl is higher than other breast tumors characterized in Example 1 (see Table 2). Tumors were allowed to grow for 39 days until they reached an average volume of 120mni3. The mice were randomized (n = 10 per group) and treated with a combination of anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 and anti-RSP02 antibody 130M23, cisplatin, a combination of anti-RSPOl and RSP02 antibodies and cisplatin, or a control antibody. Antibodies were dosed at 15mg/kg once a week and cisplatin was dosed at 1.5mg/kg twice a week. Administration of the antibodies and cisplatin was performed via injection into the intraperitoneal cavity. Tumor growth was monitored and tumor volumes were measured with electronic calipers on the indicated days. Data are expressed as mean  S.E.M.      [0351] As shown in Figure 18, a combination of anti-RSPOl antibody 89M5 and anti-     RSP02 antibody 130M23 with cisplatin inhibited tumor growth better than cisplatin alone (p = 0.04, combination group vs cisplatin alone). The triple combination had a significant effect, despite the fact that the combination of antibodies 89M5 and 130M25 without cisplatin had only a minimal effect on this tumor.

This invention relates to the field of water purification and desalination. In particular, embodiments of the invention relate to systems and methods of removing essentially all of a broad spectrum of impurities from water in an automated process that requires minimal cleaning or maintenance during the course of several months to several years, with relatively high yields of product water per unit of input water and ultra-low energy requirements.     BACKGROUND     [0002] Water purification technology is rapidly becoming an essential aspect of modern life as conventional water resources become increasingly scarce, municipal distribution systems for potable water deteriorate with age, and increased water usage depletes wells and reservoirs, causing saline water contamination. Additionally, further contamination of water sources is occurring from a variety of activities, which include, for example, intensive agriculture, gasoline additives, and heavy toxic metals. These issues are leading to increasing and objectionable levels of germs, bacteria, salts, MTBE, chlorates, perchlorates, arsenic, mercury, and even the chemicals used to disinfect potable water, in the water system.     [0003] Furthermore, even though almost three fourths of the earth is covered by oceans, fresh water resources are limited to some 3% of all planetary water and they are becoming scarcer as a result of population growth and global warming. Approximately 69% of all fresh water is held in ice caps and glaciers which, with increased global melting become unrecoverable, so less than 1% is actually available and most of that (over 90%) is ground water in aquifers that are being progressively contaminated by human activities and saline incursions. Thus, there is an urgent need for technology that can turn saline water, including seawater and brine, into fresh water, while removing a broad range of contaminants.     [0004 ] Conventional desalination and water treatment technologies, such as reverse osmosis (RO) filtration thermal distillation systems like multiple-effect distillation (MED), multiple-stage flash distillation (MSF), or vapor compression distillation (VC) are rarely able to handle the diverse range of water contaminants found in saline environments. Additionally, even though they are commercially available, they often require multiple treatment stages or combination of various technologies to achieve acceptable water quality. RO systems suffer from the requirement of high- water pressures as the saline content increases which render them increasingly expensive in commercial desalination, and they commonly waste more than 30% of the incoming feed water, making them progressively less attractive when water is scarce. Less conventional technologies, such as ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation or ozone treatment, can be effective against viruses and bacteria, but seldom remove other contaminants, such as dissolved gases, salts, hydrocarbons, and insoluble solids. Additionally, most distillation technologies, while they may be superior at removing a subset of contaminants are frequently unable to handle all types of contaminants.     [0005] Because commercial desalination plants are normally complex engineering projects that require one to three years of construction, they normally are capital intensive and difficult to move from one place to another. Their complexity and reliance on multiple technologies also make them prone to high maintenance costs. Thus, because RO plants are designed to operate continuously under steady pressure and flow conditions, large pressure fluctuations or power interruptions can damage the membranes, which are expensive to replace; that technology requires extensive pre-treatment of the incoming feed water to prevent fouling of the RO membrane. Thermal distillation systems frequently rely on vacuum to increase water recovery by extracting increasing steam with a given amount of thermal energy; however, vacuum systems in large-scale systems are troublesome because of leaks and require mechanical reinforcement. Thermal systems also rely on heat exchangers to recover some of the heat of condensation, but heat exchangers are prone to fouling and scale formation and require frequent maintenance.     [0006] Accordingly, sophisticated distillation systems that are continuous and self-cleaning, that resist corrosion, that are portable and compact and recover a major fraction of the input water, and that are relatively inexpensive and low- maintenance appear as the best long-term option to resolve increasing water contamination problems and water scarcity, worldwide. SUMMARY     [0007 ] Embodiments of the present invention provide an improved desalination and water purification system. The system can include an inlet, a preheater, a degasser, multiple evaporation chambers and demisters, product condensers, a waste outlet, a product outlet, multiple heat pipes for heat transfer and recovery and a control system. The control system permits operation of the purification system continuously with minimal user intervention or cleaning. The system is capable of removing, from a contaminated water sample, a plurality of contaminant types including microbiological contaminants, radiological contaminants, metals, salts, volatile organics, and non-volatile organics. In embodiments of the system, the volume of water produced can be between about 20% and about 95% of a volume of input water. The system comprises a vertical stack arrangement of evaporation chambers, condensers, and a preheater that is compact and thus portable in the range of 1,000 to 50 million gallons per day of water production.     [0008] The system can also include a flow controller for the input water. The flow controller can include a pressure regulator, a pump, a solenoid, a valve, an aperture, and the like. The pressure regulator can maintain water pressure between about 0 kPa and 250 kPa. (0 to 36 psi). The flow controller can maintain water flow at a rate of between 0.5 and 3500 gallons/min. The system can include a sediment trap, a sand filter, and the like. Also, the system can further include a shutdown control. The shutdown control can be, for example, a manual control, a flood control, a tank capacity control, an evaporation chamber capacity control, or similar control device. The feedback control system can be based upon, for example, amount of water in a product water tank, flow of product water through the product outlet, time of water flow, time of no water flow, amount of water in the evaporation chamber, detection of a leak, evaporation chamber pressure, output water quality (total dissolved solids), pressure differential across evaporation chamber, evaporation chamber overflow weir float, and the like.     [0009] Also, the system can have a preheater that heats the incoming water to the temperature required in the degasser. Water exiting the preheater can have a temperature of at least about 96 <0>C. The preheat tank may have a spiral arrangement of vanes such that incoming water circulates several turns in the tank, thus providing the residence time to effect pre-heating. Incoming feed water enters the preheater tangentially, is gradually preheated by heat pipes until the required temperature is achieved, and exits the preheater through a downcomer tube that connects either with the degasser or directly with a lower evaporation chamber if there is no need for degassing.     [0010] The degasser can be in a substantially vertical orientation, having an upper end and a lower end. Pre-heated water enters the degasser at its upper end, and degassed water exits the degasser proximate to the lower end. In the system, steam from the highest evaporation chamber can enter the degasser proximate to the lower end, and can exit the degasser proximate to the upper end. The degasser can include a matrix adapted to facilitate mixing of water and steam, stripping the inlet water of essentially all organics, volatiles, and gasses by counterflowing the inlet water against an opposite directional flow of a gas in a degasser. The gas can be, for example, steam, air, nitrogen, and the like. The matrix can include substantially spherical particles. However, the matrix can also include non-spherical particles. The matrix can include particles having a size selected to permit uniform packing within the degasser. The matrix can also include particles of distinct sizes, and the particles can be arranged in the degasser in a size gradient. Water can exit the degasser, substantially free of organics and volatile gases.     [0011] The upper evaporation chamber can include a cylindrical or rectangular tank with a perforated bottom that accommodates multiple heat transfer pipes. The upper evaporation chamber can also include a central drain, which can be a downcomer tube in fluid communication with a lower evaporation chamber, or at the bottom of the evaporation chamber, or both. The evaporation chamber can also include a self cleaning medium including a plurality of particles, the drain having an opening, the opening having a size that does not permit the particles to pass through the bottom drain, the opening further having a shape that is not complementary to a shape of the particles. The evaporation chamber can include a self cleaning medium for interfering with accumulation of precipitates at least in an area proximate to a heated region of the evaporation chamber. The medium can include a plurality a particles. The particles can be substantially spherical. The particles can also include a characteristic permitting substantially continuous agitation of the particles by boiling of water in the evaporation chamber. The characteristic can be, for example, specific gravity, size, morphology, population number, and the like. The particles can have a selected hardness, so that the hardness permits scouring of the evaporation chamber by the particles without substantially eroding the particles or the evaporation chamber. Furthermore, the particles can be composed of ceramic, metal, glass, or stone. The particles can have a specific gravity greater than about 1.0 and less than about 8.0, or more preferably, between about 2.0 and about 5.0.     [0012] The upper demister can be positioned proximate to an upper surface of the evaporation chamber. Steam from the evaporation chamber can enter the demister under pressure. The demister can include a pressure differential, and the pressure differential can be no less than 125 to about 2500 Pa. The demister can be adapted to separate clean steam from waste steam via either cyclonic action or by providing mechanical barriers to mist particles being carried by steam. The ratio of clean steam to waste steam can be greater than about 10:1. The control system can adjust a parameter to regulate steam quality. Steam quality can include, for example, clean steam purity, ratio of clean steam to waste steam, and the like. The parameter can include at least one parameter such as a recess position of a clean steam outlet, a pressure differential across the demister, a resistance to flow of a steam inlet, a resistance to flow of a steam outlet, and the like.     [0013] Clean steam from the demister enters an upper condenser that includes vanes for imparting a circular motion to the steam, thus enhancing its residence time in the condenser and ensuring complete steam condensation. The condenser tan is a cylindrical or rectangular tank with a perforated top that accommodates multiple heat pipes. The heat pipes remove the heat of condensation of the steam and transfer such heat either to the upper preheater or to an upper evaporation chamber. Product water can exit the product condenser through the product outlet.     [0014 ] Multiple stages of boiling and condensation can be provided under the upper condenser, thus recycling heat for multiple stages of distillation. Except for the last stage, which is the bottom evaporation chamber, each stage consists of a evaporation chamber, a demister, a condenser, and multiple heat pipes, all identical to those described above.     [0015] The bottom evaporation chamber is identical to the upper evaporation chamber, except that a source of heat energy is placed under it or inside the evaporation chamber itself. Heat for evaporation can be electrical, natural gas, petroleum or other hydrocarbon fuels, or any source of waste heat that provides a temperature of about 110 C or higher.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION     [0103] Embodiments of the invention are disclosed herein, in some cases in exemplary form or by reference to one or more Figures. However, any such disclosure of a particular embodiment is exemplary only, and is not indicative of the full scope of the invention.     [0104 ] Embodiments of the invention include systems, methods, and apparatus for water purification and desalination. Preferred embodiments provide broad spectrum water purification that is fully automated and that does not require cleaning or user intervention over very long periods of time. For example, systems disclosed herein can run without user control or intervention for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 months, or longer. In preferred embodiments, the systems can run automatically for 1,2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13,14, or 15 years, or more.     [0105] Embodiments of the invention thus provide a water purification and desalination system including at least an inlet for saline water, contaminated water, or seawater, a preheater, a degasser, one or more evaporation chambers, one or more demisters, one or more product condensers with a product outlet, a waste outlet, and a control system, wherein product water exiting the outlet is substantially pure, and wherein a volume of product water produced is at least about 10, 15, or 20% of a volume of input water, and wherein the control system permits operation of the purification system continuously without requiring user intervention. In preferred embodiments, the volume of product water produced is at least about 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99%, or more, of the volume of input water. Thus the system is of great benefit in conditions in which there is relatively high expense or inconvenience associated with obtaining inlet water and/or disposing of wastewater. The system is significantly more efficient in terms of its production of product water per unit of input water or wastewater, than many other systems.     [0106] Substantially pure water can be, in different embodiments, water that meets any of the following criteria: water purified to a purity, with respect to any contaminant, that is at least 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 500, 750, 1000, or more, times greater purity than the inlet water. In other embodiments, substantially pure water is water that is purified to one of the foregoing levels, with respect to a plurality of contaminants present in the inlet water. That is, in these embodiments, water purity or quality is a function of the concentration of an array of one or more contaminants, and substantially pure water is water that has, for example, a 25 -fold or greater ratio between the concentration of these contaminants in the inlet water as compared to the concentration of the same contaminants in the product water.     [0107 ] In other embodiments, water purity can be measured by conductivity, where ultrapure water has a conductivity typically less than about 0.1 Siemens/cm, and distilled water typically has a conductivity of about 0.5. In such embodiments, conductivity of the product water is generally between about 0.1 and 0.77, typically between about 0.2 and 0.6, preferably between about 0.2 and 0.5, 0.2 and 0.4, or 0.2 and 0.3. Conductivity is a measure of total dissolved solids (TDS) and is a good indicator of water purity with respect to salts, ions, minerals, and the like.     [0108] Alternatively, water purity can be measured by various standards such as, for example, current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards as listed in Table 1 and Table 2, as well as other accepted standards as listed in Table 2. Accordingly, preferred embodiments of the invention are capable of reducing any of one or more contaminants from a broad range of contaminants, including for example any contaminant(s) listed in Table 1, wherein the final product water has a level for such contaminant(s) at or below the level specified in the column labeled ""MCL"" (maximum concentration level) where the inlet water has a level for such contaminant(s) that is up to about 25-fold greater than the specified MCL. Likewise, in some embodiments and for some contaminants, systems of the invention can remove contaminants to MCL levels when the inlet water has a 30-, 40-, 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-, 90-, 100-, 150-, 250-, 500-, or 1000-fold or more; higher contamination than the MCL or the product water.     [0109] While the capacity of any system to remove contaminants from inlet water is to some extent a function of the total impurity levels in the inlet water, systems of the invention are particularly well suited to remove a plurality of different contaminants, of widely different types, from a single feed stream, producing water that is comparable to distilled water and is in some cases comparable to ultrapure water. It should be noted that the ""Challenge Water"" column in Table 1 contains concentration levels for contaminants in water used in EPA tests.

Various alternative configurations to the vertical stacked arrangement are possible to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, a lateral arrangement of evaporation chambers, condensers, and preheater, and the like.     [0112] Figures 21, 22, and 23 illustrate an alternative embodiment of a vertically stacked arrangement of evaporation chambers 1, 3 and 5 and condensers 2, 4 and 6 whereby a source of heat is provided at the bottom of the stack, a preheater 7 is provided at the top of the stack, a degasser 8 is provided at the top of the system to remove volatile organic compounds from the incoming water, a plurality of demisters 9 are provided to remove contaminated mist particles from each evaporation chamber, a plurality of heat pipes 10 are provided to recover heat from each condenser and transfer such heat to an upper evaporation chamber, and a waste stream outlet 11 is provided to remove and drain water contaminants. In such an alternative embodiment, all the evaporation chambers, condensers, and preheaters are encased in an outer shell 300, and the individual tanks are separated by plates, some of which are perforated plates 301 in order to accommodate the passage of heat pipes 10, degasser 8, hot brine overflow tubes 21, waste stream tube 11, and demisters 9. This alternative embodiment confers certain cost advantages in manufacturing, and provides for a simpler configuration that minimizes heat losses.     [0113] Incoming water containing contaminants, such as saline water or seawater, continuously enters the system at the top into a preheater tank 7. The volume of flow into the system is controlled by a flow controller, which can be a constant flow pump, a variable flow pump with a control valve, or various electronic control sensors that control the incoming flow pressure. In connection with the flow controller, optionally the flow controller can moderate water flow into the system by varying pressure, and such pressure variations can be signaled by detection within the system of greater demand for inlet water, and the like. This variable control of flow, rather than binary control of flow, can permit capturing certain efficiencies in the system. Alternatively, the incoming flow volume into the system may be controlled by a signal received indicating that the system is capable of receiving additional water for the purification process. Such feedback of demand for more inlet water can come from various points within the system including, for example, water level in the evaporation chamber(s) 1, 3 and 5, water level in the product condenser(s) 2, 4 and 6, temperature of preheated water entering the degasser 8, temperature or volume of steam leaving the evaporation chamber(s), and the like. [0114 ] Other controls and feedback points can provide further benefit in the automated function of the system including, for example, detection of water quality at any point in the system, detection of volume of water or steam at any point in the system, detection of leaks or temperatures that are indicative of a system malfunction, and the like. Embodiments of the system contemplate all such controls and combinations of controls. These include, for example, controls detecting flooding, evaporation chamber capacity, and the like. In various embodiments, feedback can be qualitative and/or quantitative. These can include, for example, the amount of water in a product condenser(s), flow of product water through the product outlet, time of water flow, amount of water in the evaporation chamber, detection of a leak, evaporation chamber pressure, output water quality (such as, for example, a measure of total dissolved solids), pressure differential across the evaporation chamber or across other points in the system, flow of water across an evaporation chamber overflow, and the like.     [0115] Once heat energy is supplied either by electricity, natural gas or oil burners, or waste heat and the system is turned on, the system is configured for fully automatic control essentially throughout the life of the system. The system includes various feedback mechanisms to avoid flooding and to regulate water flow, pressure, output, and continuous cleaning, such that user intervention under normal circumstances is not required. Among these controls is a float level detector in the preheater 7, a side float switch, a timer, temperature sensors, and a power meter.     [0116] Shut down controls include a manual control, a flood control which can be a float or a moisture detector in the base of the system, a condenser capacity control and an evaporation chamber capacity control. In addition to controls that provide binary, on/off, switching of inlet water or other parameters, the system further contemplates variable controls such as, for example, pressure- or volume-based flow controls, pressure regulators, and the like. In preferred embodiments, a pressure regulator can regulate inlet water pressure so that it is between 0 and 250 kPa, for example. In other embodiments, the pressure can be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 275, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 kPa, or more. Regulation of pressure, optionally in combination with regulation of other parameters, can attenuate volume and velocity of water flow in the system. For example, pressure regulation in combination with the dimensions of the system can provide water flow rates of between 2.5 and 132,000 liters/min, or more. Although the systems described herein are primarily described in terms of relatively large scale water production, the system is scalable to any volume of water production. Accordingly there is no upper or lower limit to the volume of water flow. Exemplary flow rates, however, include ranges of 10 to 500 ml/min, 5 to 1,000 liters/min, 30 to 30,000 liter/min, 400 to 200,000 liter/min, and the like.     [0117 ] The system can further include a sediment trap capable of removing sediments from inlet water, so as to avoid premature fouling of the system with such sediments. Various sorts of sediment traps are known in the art, and can be selected for use with the systems of the invention. Likewise, to minimize user intervention and need for cleaning, a sediment trap can itself have self-cleaning features. For example, a sediment trap can have alternating sand filters, or revolving screens, wherein rotation from a fouled screen to a new screen can be driven by a water pressure differential across the device, such that when a screen reaches a certain saturation point in terms of accumulated sediments, it is switched for a screen that is not fouled by sediments. In some embodiments, a fouled screen or sand filter can be placed into a flow path of water such that water flows across the sand filter or screen in an opposite direction from that of the original flow across the screen, thus dislodging sediments to a waste pathway or drain. Accordingly the systems disclosed herein contemplate use of conventional as well as self-cleaning sediment traps.     [0118] The preheat function of the water purification and desalination system preferably involves a preheater 7. However, this function can be performed in numerous different ways, provided that the result is that saline water or seawater flowing into the system arrives at the degasser 8 at a temperature of about 90<0>C or more. Accordingly, the preheat function can be embodied in numerous different forms, including, for example, a cylindrical tank, a rectangular tank, or different configurations of any sort with a design permitting a high ratio of surface area to internal volume, and the like.     [0119] In preferred embodiments, such as illustrated by Figures 9, 10, and 11, the preheater is heated by a plurality of heat pipes 10 that penetrate the preheater through the bottom. These heat pipes transfer the heat of condensation from a condenser into the incoming seawater or saline water. As seawater or saline water enters the preheater 7 through orifice 71, the incoming water is gradually heated to near boiling temperature by the heat pipes 10 as water flows in a spiral pattern imposed by spiral vanes on the bottom of the preheater. As the incoming seawater or saline water reaches near boiling temperature close to the upper center of the preheater, it exits the preheater through tube 82 and enters near the top of the degasser 8. The dimensions and configuration of the preheater are such as to allow for sufficient residence time to elevate the temperature of the water in the preheater to about 90<0>C or more. Depending upon the scale of the system, and the capacity of the system for throughput of water, the pre-heating function can benefit from materials and configurations that permit efficient heat exchange. Alternatively, in some embodiments, durability of construction, space considerations, ease of maintenance, availability or expense of materials, as well as other considerations can affect the design choices in this aspect of the invention.     [0120] In some embodiments, the system can beneficially function under nonstandard environmental conditions such as, for example, high altitude. At high altitudes, the boiling point of water, including saline water or seawater is less than 100<0>C, and thus with normal rates of application of heat to the evaporation chamber will generate a greater amount of steam and will permit a higher quantitative throughput in the system. In such embodiments, it is evident that preheat temperatures may also be affected. Given lower evaporation chamber temperatures and lower condenser temperatures, preheating to a desired temperature can be achieved by permitting longer residence time of water in the preheater such as, for example, by configuring the preheater to have a greater volume with an identical flow rate, or a lower flow rate with an identical volume. However, due to elevated levels of steam generation in the evaporation chamber, in most embodiments, adjusting downward the flow rate in the preheat tube to achieve beneficial residence times and desirable preheat temperatures, would be disfavored. This is because the greater rate of steam generation implies a concomitant higher demand for inlet water.     [0121] Degassing is accomplished by steam stripping as illustrated by Figures 12 and 13. A key factor in degasser performance is mass transfer ratio: the mass of water going downward in a vertical degasser as compared to the mass of steam going upward. Indeed, degassing function can be accomplished with various configurations that permit mass-transfer counterflow of water with a gas. In a preferred embodiment, the gas is steam; in others the gas can be air, nitrogen, and the like. The velocity and activity of mixing of water with steam is affected by the size, conformation, and packing of the degasser column medium, as well as the void volume between the particles of the medium. In preferred embodiments, the particles of the medium pack to form a spiral. The performance of the degasser is affected by the velocity and volume of steam and water passing therethrough; these can be controlled by such factors as the size of the steam inlet and outlet orifice, water flow rate, and the like. Useful information relating to degasser function and design is provided in Williams, Robert The Geometrical Foundation of Natural Structure: A Source Book of Design, New York: Dover, 1979, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.     [0122] Control of inlet water flow rate, avoidance of large steam bubbles in the degasser, and the like, can therefore aid efficient function of the degasser. When these parameters are not within a desirable range, flooding or jetting can occur in the degasser. Flooding of inlet water forms a water plug in the degasser and jetting shoots water out of the degasser with the steam, either of which can interfere with degasser performance. It is therefore desirable to operate in a zone that minimizes flooding and jetting and that has a good balance between water influx and steam efflux. The degasser of embodiments of the present invention is particularly important in that it is not designed to remove strictly one contaminant as many conventional degassers are. Instead it removes a variety of contaminants very effectively. In typical settings, where the inlet water has a contaminant at, for example, 1 ppm the process seeks to achieve reduction to 50, 40, 10, 5, 2, or 1 ppb.     [0123] Degassing water is normally achieved by heating the incoming water to increase the vapor pressure of volatile compounds. At the boiling point of each compound, the solubility of the dissolved gas drops to zero and the gas will then exit the water. For example, many of the volatile substances found in drinking water are chlorinated compounds that normally have very large partial pressures at temperatures well below the boiling point of water. Thus, many of these substances can be removed from water by heating the water to temperatures of about 200-210 <0>F (93-99C) to effect proper degassing. However, the substances do not completely leave the water immediately; thus, it takes some period of time to completely remove the dissolved gases. [0124 ] One difficulty with previous degasser designs is that they have little control of the residence time of the heated water in the degasser. Consequently, when excessive amounts of volatile substances are present in the incoming water, there may not be sufficient residence time provided to effect degassing of all the volatile substances. Additionally, many degassers operate in the absence of pressure controls, which can lead to excessive loss of water vapor, when water vapor is the medium selected for effecting mass transfer of the volatile components out of the system.     [0125] Another issue in degasser design is scalability. While large industrial degassers operate with substantial pressure drops and large volumes of both liquid and gases that are effective for mass transfer and, thus, degassing, small degassers do not scale down well. What is needed is a more compact degasser that allows for additional residence time and that is also capable of limiting the amount of wasted steam.     [0126] In some embodiments, a degasser is provided, which has concentric layers of particles, where an inner layer of particles is configured to result in comparatively small spaces between the particles, and where an outer layer of particles is configured to result in comparatively larger spaces between the particles. In various embodiments, the particles exhibit random and structured packing in the degasser. The particles can be made of a material such as, metal, glass, and plastic. The degasser can have a water entrance at the top. The degasser can have a waste steam exit at the top, and have a heated steam entrance and water exit at the bottom.     [0127 ] In some embodiments, a degasser apparatus is provided that has a container that holds concentric layers of particles, where an inner layer of particles is configured to result in small spaces between the particles, where a middle layer of particles is configured to result in medium spaces between the particles, and where an outer layer of particles is configured to result in larger spaces between the particles. The medium spaces are such that water vapor in the system begins to condense out of the gas phase, and the small spaces are small enough that this process continues so that water vapor is transformed into liquid water.     [0128] In other embodiments, the degasser container has a steam entrance at the bottom outer periphery of the container. The steam entrance allows heating steam from a evaporation chamber to enter the container at the outer periphery and heat the outer periphery of the inside of the degasser. The container has a steam exit at the top of the container where waste steam exits the system. The container has a water entrance at the top of the container. The container has a purified water exit at the bottom of the container. The water exit is located, for example, in the center bottom of the container. The container is filled with particles. There are, in some embodiments, three sizes of particles and each particle of a given size is located in a concentric zone; thus, in such embodiments, there are three concentric zones, each having a particle of a given size. In a preferred embodiment, the particles are glass beads. In a more preferred embodiment, there are three sizes of particles with the largest sized particle in an outermost zone of the container and the smallest sized particle in an innermost zone of the container.     [0129] Some embodiments include a compact, more effective, degasser. The degasser preferably employs concentric layers of varying porosity so that a zone is created in the degasser that allows steam to pass and another zone is created that promotes water vapor condensation. The degasser includes particles inside the degasser that add surface area to the inside of the degasser, thereby allowing for a greater residence time for the water to be purified.     [0130] In some embodiments, the porosity of the system is achieved through differently sized particles. In these embodiments, the particles in the outer layer have a relatively large size so that heating steam can more readily pass from a source of steam, such as an evaporation chamber, into and throughout the degasser. This heating steam, coming from the evaporation chamber, can also act as an insulator to keep the inside temperature of the system near the boiling point. Inside the outer layer of larger sized particles is a layer of medium sized particles. This layer of medium sized particles provides for adequate permeability and long residence time, allowing for a higher percentage of the volatile substances to be degassed. This medium sized layer of pores and particles is more likely to condense water from the steam, as there is less space between the particles. The inner layer includes smaller sized particles, so that the pores are mostly filled with degassed water, which flows, by gravity, into the evaporation chamber.     [0131] The degasser system is preferably located in close proximity to the evaporation chamber apparatus. Preferably, the degasser unit is located on the top of an evaporation chamber. This allows steam from the evaporation chamber to rise directly from the evaporation chamber into the degasser. This also allows the degassed water from the degasser to drain straight into the evaporation chamber. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, there need not be any significant separation between the evaporation chamber and the degasser. In one embodiment, only a screen, to retain the particles, separates the degasser from the evaporation chamber.     [0132] The particles can be of any shape, for example, spherical, semi- spherical, amorphous, rectangular, oblong, square, rounded, polyhedral, irregular (such as gravel, for example), and the like. The particle surface can be varied as desired, such as, for example, solid, porous, semi-porous, coated, or structured to provide large residence time, and the like. Preferably, the particles are spherical and nonporous. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the differently sized particles will have differently sized spaces between them (interstitial spaces). For example, larger glass spheres will have larger spaces than smaller glass spheres. The size of the interparticle space can vary based on the size of the particles, the shape of the particles, and other factors. As a general rule, generally spherical particles that are larger will also result in a mixture with larger porosity. That is, there will be relatively large spaces between the spheres. Likewise, particles that are smaller will have smaller interstitial spaces, resulting in an environment that is more likely to condense steam into liquid water.     [0133] The particles can be made of any suitable material. Exemplary materials include but are not limited to metal, glass, composites, ceramics, plastics, stone, cellulosic materials, fibrous materials and the like. A mixture of materials can be used if desired. One of skill in the art will be able to determine a suitable material for each specific purpose. Preferably, the material is made of glass. The chosen material will preferable be capable of standing up to long term high temperature use without significant cracking, breaking, other damage, or leaching toxic materials into the water. If desired, the differently sized particles can be made of different materials. For example, the outer particles can be made of metal, the middle layer of temperature resistant plastic, and the center layer of glass. The chosen material can preferably be resistant to breakage, rust, or cracking due to the heating process.     [0134 ] In some embodiments, rather than altering the size of the particles, other properties of the particles are altered, such as the surface properties of the particles. Further, if desired, the degasser can be packed with a mixture of differently sized particles, where the packing procedure is performed so as to allow a progressively smaller particle size to fill the center regions of the degasser. In some embodiments, the layers are packed with particles that are homogeneous throughout the layer. In other embodiments, the layers are heterogeneous and can contain other shaped beads, particles, glass wool, etc. Heterogeneity of the particles can include not only size but also, for example, composition, surface characteristics, density, specific heat, wettability (hydophobicity versus hydrophilicity), hardness, ductility, and the like. Preferably, as discussed above, the heterogeneity in whatever form it takes is distributed in concentric rings within the degasser, although other arrangements that are not concentric are also contemplated in some embodiments of the invention.     [0135] Examples of volatile contaminants that can be removed or lessened by treatment of water with the method of the present invention include but are not limited to, methyl tertiary butyl ether, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, p-dichlorobenzene, 1,1-dichloroethylene, cis-l,2-dichloroethylene trans- 1 ,2-dicholoroethylene, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,2- dichloropropane, ethylbenzene, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, 1,1,1,-trichloroethane, 1 , 1 ,2-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, toluene, vinyl chloride, xylenes, natural gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, chlorine, bromine, fluorine, and hydrogen, other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as formic acid, ethyl hydrazine, methyl methacrylate, butyl ethyl amine, butanol, propanol, acetaldehyde, acetonitrile, butyl amine, ethyl amine, ethanol, methanol, acetone, allyl amine, allyl alcohol, methyl acetate, ammonium hydroxide, and ammonia, and the like.     [0136] As illustrated by Figures 7A and 7B, once the incoming saline water or seawater has been degassed, it flows by gravity into a lower evaporation chamber 3. This boiling tank can be of essentially any size and configuration depending upon the desired throughput of the system and other design choices made based upon the factors affecting system design. For example, the evaporation chamber can have a volume capacity of about 100 gallon or 2,000-10,000 gallons, 11,000-100,000 gallons, or more. Because the system of the invention is completely scalable, the size of the evaporation chamber is variable and can be selected as desired. Likewise, the configuration of the evaporation chamber can be varied as desired. For example, the evaporation chamber can be cylindrical, spherical, rectangular, or any other shape. In a preferred embodiment, the evaporation chamber 3 is cylindrical, is perforated by a plurality of heat pipes 10 through the bottom of the evaporation chamber, has a centrally positioned discharge tube 21 that carries excess hot saline water down into a lower evaporation chamber, and has a demister 9 mounted on top of the evaporation chamber. In this preferred configuration, the waste stream 11 that carries volatile constituents from the degasser top also traverses the evaporation chamber vertically. Clean steam 91 from the demister flows upward into an upper condenser 4.     [0137 ] Because the operation of the purification system is continuous, saline water or seawater is partially concentrated by boiling, and the degree of concentration in evaporation chamber 3 is determined by the number of distillation stages. Thus, if two stages of distillation are being used, the degree of salinity in the evaporation chamber is kept at half the value of the waste brine to be rejected, or about 12%. If three stages of distillation are used, the degree of salinity in evaporation chamber 3 is allowed to reach about one third of the final brine concentration of about 23%.     [0138] In a preferred embodiment, the evaporation chamber drains by gravity only, through drain tube 21. In other embodiments draining the evaporation chamber is driven by pumping action. Continuous draining of the evaporation chamber 3 maintains a constant level of boiling fluid in the chamber, and such continuous drainage also avoids the settling of sediments, salts, and other particulates in the evaporation chamber.     [0139] Figure 18 illustrates the self-cleaning mechanism that prevents scale deposition in the evaporation chamber. Scale tends to form preferentially at the hotter surfaces which, in the case of evaporation chamber 3, correspond to the top surfaces of each heat pipe 10. In a preferred embodiment, the heat pipes are surrounded by a perforated cylinder 27 and a plurality of ceramic balls 28. The self- cleaning medium can be selected from any of a number of suitable alternatives. Such alternatives include glass or ceramic beads or balls, stones, synthetic structures of any of a variety of shapes, and the like. In every case, the properties of the self-cleaning medium will be selected such that agitation by boiling water will displace individual particles of the self-cleaning medium, but that such displacement will be overcome by the physical properties of the self-cleaning medium causing each particle to fall again to the side of each heat pipe and to the bottom of the evaporation chamber, striking and dislodging any deposits or scale. For example, a self-cleaning medium with a relatively high specific gravity but with a relatively small surface to volume ratio may function in a way that is roughly comparable to a second self-cleaning medium with a lower specific gravity but a relatively higher surface to volume ratio. In each case, a skilled artisan is able to select the combination of morphology, and composition to achieve the desired result. In some embodiments, an alternative approach to self- cleaning is employed, such as, for example, application of ultrasonic energy.     [0140] Another consideration in the design choice of the self-cleaning medium is the hardness thereof. In general, the hardness should be roughly comparable to the hardness of the material of which the evaporation chamber is composed. This permits continued use of the self-cleaning medium over long periods of time without significant erosion of the medium or of the walls or bottom of the evaporation chamber. In some embodiments, in which the heating element of the evaporation chamber is internal to the chamber, such as the case with heat pipes 10, hardness and other properties of the self-cleaning medium can be selected so as to avoid erosion and/or other damage to the heating element as well as to the evaporation chamber itself.     [0141] Because of the self-cleaning function provided by the structure of the evaporation chamber and the evaporation chamber cleaning medium, the system of embodiments of the invention does not require cleaning during its normal life span of use. In some embodiments no cleaning is required for 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months. In other embodiments, no cleaning is required for 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 months. In other embodiments, no cleaning is required for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years, or more.     [0142] The residence time of water in the evaporation chamber can vary within a range based upon the nature of the inlet water and the desired performance of the system. The suitable range is determined by various factors, including whether biological contaminants are in the input water. Effective removal of biological contaminants can require a variable amount of time being exposed to the high temperatures in the evaporation chamber. Some biological contaminants are more quickly susceptible to high heat than are others. In many embodiments, a residence time as short as 10 minutes is sufficient to kill most biological contaminants. In other embodiments, longer residence times may be desired in order to more thoroughly eliminate a broader spectrum of biological contaminants. The upper end of the range of residence time in the evaporation chamber is typically dictated by efficiency considerations relating to the desired rate of generation of product water in comparison with the energy required to maintain a selected volume of water at boiling temperature. Accordingly, residence time in the evaporation chamber can be as little as the minimal time required for water to reach boiling point and evolve as steam, to time points beneficial to removal of biological contaminants such as, for example, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 minutes and the like and so on. Further, higher residence times such as, for example, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 minutes, or more, may be selected in some embodiments.     [0143] Steam produced in the evaporation chamber is generally free of particulates, sediments, and other contaminants. However, boiling action can cause certain contaminants to be carried into the vapor phase, for example on the surface of microdroplets of mist formed at the air/water interface. In addition, steam can condense into droplets on the underside of the evaporation chamber top, as illustrated in Figure 14. Such droplets 14 can migrate laterally and can enter the demister device 9 with the flow of steam. A metal groove 13 prevents such droplets from migrating and contaminating the steam flow. In addition, a baffle guard 15 may also provide a barrier to mist particles being carried by the steam. Figure 15 provides a picture of a baffle guard mounted on the underside of a evaporation chamber.     [0144 ] In addition to the above steam cleaning mechanisms, clean steam can be separated from such contaminant-laden mist with use of a demister. Various kinds of demisters are known in the known in the art, including those employing screens, baffles, and the like, to separate steam from mist based upon size and mobility. Preferred demisters are those that employ cyclonic action to separate steam from mist based upon differential density. Cyclones work on the principle of moving a fluid or gas at high velocities in a radial motion, exerting centrifugal force on the components of the fluid or gas. Conventional cyclones have a conical section that in some cases can aid in the angular acceleration. Key parameters controlling the efficiency of the cyclone separation are the size of the steam inlet, the size of the two outlets, for clean steam and for contaminant-laden mist, and the pressure differential between the entry point and the outlet points. [0145] As illustrated by Figures 3 and 16, the demister is typically positioned within or above the evaporation chamber 1 or 3, permitting steam from the chamber to enter the demister through an inlet orifice 92. Steam entering a demister through such an orifice has an initial velocity that is primarily a function of the pressure differential between the evaporation chamber and the demister, and the configuration of the orifice. Typically, the pressure differential across the demister is about 0.5 to 10 column inches of water - about 125 to 2500 Pa. The inlet orifice is generally designed to not provide significant resistance to entry of steam into the cyclone. At high velocities, such as in the cyclone cone area 93, the clean steam, relatively much less dense than the mist, migrates toward the center of the cyclone, while the mist moves toward the periphery. A clean steam outlet 91 positioned in the center of the cyclone provides an exit point for the clean steam, while a mist outlet 94 positioned near the bottom of the cyclone permits efflux of mist from the demister. Clean steam passes from the demister to a condenser, while mist is directed to again enter the evaporation chamber. In typical operation, clean steam to mist ratios are at least about 2:1; more commonly 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, or 6:1; preferably 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, or 10:1, and most preferably greater than 10:1. Demister selectivity can be adjusted based upon several factors including, for example, position and size of the clean steam exit opening, pressure differential across the demister, configuration and dimensions of the demister, and the like. Further information regarding demister design is provided in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No: 60/697107 entitled, IMPROVED CYCLONE DEMISTER, filed July 6, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The demisters disclosed herein are extremely efficient in removal of submicron-level contaminants. In contrast, demisters of other designs such as, for example, screen-type and baffle-type demisters, are much less effective at removing submicron-level contaminants.     [0146] Clean steam is condensed in a condenser typically positioned directly above each evaporation chamber. Excess heat can be exhausted by a heat sink, a fan, a heat exchanger, or a heat pipe. In a preferred embodiment, heat is removed from the condenser by heat pipes, as illustrated by Figures 5, 6 and 8. A discussion of heat pipes for transferring heat from condensing steam to inlet water is provided in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No: 60/727,106, entitled ENERGY- EFFICIENT DISTILLATION SYSTEM, filed October 14, 2005, and U.S. Patent Application No. 12/090,248, also entitled ENERGY-EFFICIENT DISTILLATION SYSTEM, filed September 9, 2008 and published as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0218210, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.     [0147 ] Clean steam enters the condenser 2 or 4 or 6 via tube 91 from the demister. As it enters the condenser, the steam rotates in a spiral fashion which increases residence time and render condensation most effective. The spiral motion of the steam in the condenser is effected by spiral vanes. Heat of condensation is removed by a plurality of heat pipes 10, mounted on the upper surface of the condenser. As heat is removed by the heat pipes and transferred upward to an upper evaporation chamber or preheater, steam condenses into product water that exists through a clean water outlet 24. Both waste steam tube 11 and the brine overflow tube 21 that carries hot brine from an upper evaporation chamber to a lower one, traverse the condenser.     [0148] Figures 2 and 3 illustrate a preferred configuration of the bottom evaporation chamber and the heating system. Intermediate boiling and condensers as may be employed in multiple distillation stages are entirely similar to those described above and are not repeated. The bottom evaporation chamber 1 represents the last stage of saline concentration by evaporation, and waste brine concentration from this stage is at or below about 23% salt, so as to prevent crystallization at any point in the system. Hot saline brine enters the bottom evaporation chamber 1 through tube 21 which causes a hydraulic over-pressure of several inches of water, or sufficient to maintain boiling temperatures that are 5 -25 C higher than the topmost evaporation chamber, thus ensuring efficient heat transfer between various distillation stages. Another tube placed inside the evaporation chamber and connected to the waste drain stream 11 maintains a constant level of boiling brine in the evaporation chamber, and continuously removes waste brine and any particulates in suspension. Steam produced in the evaporation chamber enters demister 9 where it is cleaned.     [0149] Energy for distillation is provided by a heater tank 21 positioned at the bottom of evaporation chamber 1. Figure 4 illustrates various different configurations for providing heat. Figure 4(a) illustrates the fact that the subject of this invention is energy agnostic. The proposed system for desalination can use any form of energy as energy source 211, including electricity, natural gas, oil or hydrocarbons, or even waste heat sources, as long as they deliver heat at temperatures higher than 120-130 C. Figure 4(b) illustrates the simplest configuration, consisting of either an oil or a gas burner 212. Figure 4(c) depicts an electric heater, provided with power supply 216 and resistive heater 213. Figure 4(d) illustrates resistive heating, using resistive heaters 213 surrounded by an insulating sleeve 214 and connected to a power source 216, of heat pipes 215 that subsequently transfer the heat into a evaporation chamber. And Figure 4(e) illustrates the utilization of waste heat 217 by using heat pipes 215.     [0150] Figure 17 illustrates the principle of operation of conventional heat pipes. A heat pipe consists of a sealed tube 17 under partial vacuum, partially filled with a small volume of working fluid 18, which typically may be water, and also filled with a capillary wick 19. A heat source 25 provides energy in the form of enthalpy to one end of the heat pipe, and that energy causes the evaporation of the working fluid 18. The vapor of the working fluid immediately fills the tube because it is under partial vacuum. As soon as the working fluid vapor reaches the opposite end of the heat pipe, which is at slightly lower temperature, it condenses and provides the same enthalpy back in the from of heat of condensation. As the working fluid condenses into a liquid, it is adsorbed by the capillary wick which carries it back to the starting point. Because the heat of evaporation is, by definition, equal to the heat of condensation, a heat pipe transfers heat very efficiently without appreciable losses in temperature, other than heat losses through the wall.     [0151] Figure 19 illustrates a preferred configuration for attaching heat pipes to evaporation chamber 3 and condenser 2, so as to prevent leakage. A circular sleeve 36 is either welded or otherwise attached to the heat pipe 10. A smaller diameter sleeve is welded or otherwise attached to the evaporation chamber bottom 26 or the upper condenser top 37. Screws 34 attach these sleeves under pressure so as to compress O-ring 33.     [0152] The materials of construction for the evaporation chambers and preheaters can be any material that resists corrosion in saline environments. In a preferred embodiment, the evaporation chambers and preheaters are manufactured using a titanium alloy, such as Ti-6A1-4V, which is known to resist corrosion of hot seawater. Alternatively, conventional carbon steel may be used when coated with specific chlorofluorocarbon polymers (e.g., Teflon), or a variety of polymer materials that resist boiling temperatures and saline environments. These materials of construction are exemplary and are not intended as limitations on the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art may consider alternative materials and coatings, such as other metals and alloys, which are encompassed within the spirit of the invention and are defined by the scope of the disclosure.     [0153] In some embodiments, the system for purifying water, embodiments of which are disclosed herein, can be combined with other systems and devices to provide further beneficial features. For example, the system can be used in conjunction with any of the devices or methods disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No: 60/676870 entitled, SOLAR ALIGNMENT DEVICE, filed May 2, 2005; U.S. Provisional Patent Application No: 60/697104 entitled, VISUAL WATER FLOW INDICATOR, filed July 6, 2005; U.S. Provisional Patent Application No: 60/697106 entitled, APPARATUS FOR RESTORING THE MINERAL CONTENT OF DRINKING WATER, filed July 6, 2005; U.S. Provisional Patent Application No: 60/697107 entitled, IMPROVED CYCLONE DEMISTER, filed July 6, 2005; PCT Application No: US2004/039993, filed December 1, 2004; PCT Application No: US2004/039991, filed December 1, 2004; PCT Application No US06/40103, filed Oct. 13, 2006, PCT Application No: US06/40553, filed Oct. 16, 2006; PCT Application No. US2007/005270, filed March 2, 2007, PCT Application No. US2008/003744, filed March 21, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No: 60/526,580, filed December 2, 2003; each of the foregoing applications is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.     [0154 ] One skilled in the art will appreciate that these methods and devices are and may be adapted to carry out the objects and obtain the ends and advantages mentioned, as well as various other advantages and benefits. The methods, procedures, and devices described herein are presently representative of preferred embodiments and are exemplary and are not intended as limitations on the scope of the invention. Changes therein and other uses will occur to those skilled in the art which are encompassed within the spirit of the invention and are defined by the scope of the disclosure.     CONTROL INSTRUMENTATION     [0155] This discussion is aided by reference to Figure 20. When the main power switch is energized, the control circuitry determines start-up procedures and, subsequently, continuous operation. Initially, power is delivered to the intake pump that begins to feed water to the entire system at a constant flow rate. The user inputs include ""start,"" ""pause/hold,"" and maintenance mode, and the user status can show the operating mode and sensor status either via a display, a remote terminal, or via the Internet. A temperature sensor at the upper evaporation chamber detects temperatures lower than the boiling point of water and that activates a solenoid valve that diverts the output of all condensers to a waste drain. The sensor inputs include one or more of evaporation chamber temperature, degasser temperature, demister temperature, inlet water turbidity (total dissolved solids), outlet water turbidity (total dissolved solids), and water overflow. Simultaneously, the same temperature sensor activates an energy input switch that activates energy input into the heater chamber. Depending on whether the heater system operates with electricity, gas, oil, or waste heat, the input switch turns on power to the electric coils, turns on fuel supply and ignites burners, or switches on a waste heat supply, respectively.     [0156] As the system comes up to temperature, the sensor in the upper evaporation chamber reaches boiling temperature, at which point it activates a solenoid valve that closes the drainage of all condensers and allows the delivery of product water.     [0157 ] The control circuitry includes a number of safety features, all of which turn power off the system while activating a warning light or audible signal. Conductivity sensors located at the product outlet continuously monitor water quality, and turn off the system if such quality deteriorates past a pre-determined point. Specifically, the operation states include water quality alert, water quality error, and operating modes such as startup, normal, maintenance, and off; external system control may be enabled by source water flow or evaporation chamber heat. Similarly, a temperature sensor at the heating chamber prevents overheating of the system. A conductivity probe located at the waste drain stream measures the concentration of the waste brine and shuts off the system if such concentration exceeds 23% salt so as to prevent crystallization problems inside the system. The desalination control can be enabled by inlet flow control or by evaporation chamber drain.

FIELD OF INVENTION      [0002] The present invention describes compounds and methods useful as pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors, useful for the treatment of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and related conditions.      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION      [0003] Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major public health problem. Currently, an estimated 350 million people worldwide and 1.4 million in the US are chronically infected with HBV (McMahon, 2005). Approximately one-third of these individuals will die from serious liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, if left untreated (Lee, 1997; Lok, 2004).      [0004] Seven drugs are currently available for the management of chronic hepatitis B, which include two formulations of alpba-interferon (standard and pegylaied) and five nuc3eos(t)ide analogues (lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine. and tenofovir) that inhibit HBV DNA polymerase (Keeffe et al., 2008). At present, the preferred first-line treatment choices are entecavir, tenofovir or peg-interferon alfa-2a. However, even with the first-line treatment options, peg- interferon alfa-2a is effective in achieving certain serological milestones in only one-third of treated patients and frequently associated with severe side effects (Janssen et al., 2005; Lau et al., 2005; Perrillo, 2009). Entecavir and tenofovir are highly potent HBV inhibitors, but a long-term or possibly life-time treatment is required to continuously suppress HBV replication, which may eventually fail due to emergence of drug resistant viruses (Dienstag, 2009). Hence, there is a pressing need for the introduction of novel, safe and effective therapies for chronic hepatitis B, which is listed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as a High Priority Area of Interest.      [0005] HBV is a noncytopathic, liver tropic DNA virus belonging to Hepadnaviridae family. Pregenomic (pg) RNA is the template for reverse transcriptional replication of HBV DNA and its encapsidation, together with viral DNA polymerase, into nucleocapsid is essential for the   subsequent viral DNA synthesis. Inhibition of pregenomic RNA (pg) encapsidation would block HBV replication and provide a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of HBV.      [0006] Clinically, inhibition of pregenomic RNA (pg) encapsidation offers the following therapeutic advantages: First, inhibition of pregenomic RNA (pg) encapsidation will complement the current medications by providing an additional option for a subpopulation of patients that do not tolerate or benefit from the current medications(Akbar et al., 2009; Liaw, 2009; Peters, 2009; Wiegand, van Bommel, and Berg). Second, based on their distinct antiviral mechanism, inhibition of pregenomic RNA (pg) encapsidation will be effective against HBV variants that are resistant to the currently available DNA polymerase inhibitors (Zoulim and Locarnini, 2009). Third, like the Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (Este and Cihlar), combination therapy of the inhibitors of pregenomic RNA (pg) encapsidation with DNA polymerase inhibitors should synergistically suppress HBV replication and prevent the emergence of drag resistance and thus offers a safer and more effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B infection.      [0007] There is a long felt need for new antiviral dmgs that are both disease- modifying and effective in treating patients that are infected with hepatitis B vims. There is also a clear and present need for new antiviral dmgs that are both disease modifying and effective in treating patients that are infected with drug resistant hepatitis B virus. The present invention addresses the need for new antiviral drugs that are both disease-modifying and effective in treating patients that are infected with hepatitis B virus.      BREIF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION      [0008] The present invention is directed toward the novel method of use of sulfamoylbenzamide derivatives of the formula (I), useful as pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of HBV for the treatment of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and related conditions.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000004_0001"" />Including hydrates, solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and complexes thereof, wherein:      R<!> is hydrogen;      R<2> is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, trifluoromethyl, fluorine, and chlorine;     R' is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, fluorine, and chlorine;      R<4> is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, and methyl;      R<J> is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen and chlorine;      R' is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and bromine;     9 is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, fluorine, and chlorine;      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000005_0001"" />    <)>\ The present invention is farther directed toward the novel method of use of sulfamoylbenzamide derivatives of the formula (11), useful as pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of HBV for the treatment of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and related conditions. <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000005_0002"" />Including hydrates, solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and complexes thereof, wherein:      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000006_0001"" />    [0010] The present invention is farther directed toward the novel method of use of sulfamoylbenzamide derivatives of the formula (III), useful as pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of IIBV for the treatment infection and related conditions.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000006_0002"" />    Including hydrates, solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and complexes thereof, wherein:      R<10> is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, chlorine, and bromine;      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000006_0003"" />    [0011] The present invention is further directed toward the novel method of use of sulfamoylbenzamide derivatives of the formula (IV), useful as pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of HBV for the treaiment of Hepatitis B virus (IIBV) infection and related conditions,      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000006_0004"" />Including hydrates, solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and complexes thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION      [0021] The pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of the present invention are capable of treating and preventing diseases associated with pregenomic R A encapsidation, for example HBV infection. Pregenomic (pg) RNA is the template for reverse transcriptional replication of HBV DNA and its encapsidation, together with viral DNA polymerase, into nucleocapsid is essential for the subsequent viral DNA synthesis. Without wishing to be limited by theory, it is believed that inhibition of pregenomic RNA encapsidation can ameliorate, abate, or otherwise cause to be controlled, diseases associated with pregenomic RNA encapsidation, for example HBV infection.     Pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of the present invention address the clear and unmet need to identify novel and safe antiviral agents for the treatment of HBV infection that are chemically and mechanistically distinct from HBV antiviral drugs in current clinical use.      [0022] Clinically, the pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of the present invention complement the current medications by providing an additional option for a subpopulation of patients   that do not tolerate or benefit from the current medications (Akbar et ai., 2009; Liaw, 2009; Peters, 2009; Wiegand, van Bommel, and Berg). In addition, the pregenomic R A eneapsidation inhibitors of the present invention may be effective on HBV variants that are resistant to the currently available DNA polymerase inhibitors (Zoiilim and Locamini, 2009). Further, combination therapies of the pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of the present invention with DNA polymerase inhibitors may syncrgisticaily suppress HBV replication and prevent the emergence of drag resistance, offering a safer and more effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B (Billioud et al., 201 i).

[0040] For the purposed of the present invention fused ring units, as well as spirocyclic rings, bicyclic rings and the like, which comprise a single heteroatom will be considered to belong to the cyclic family corresponding to the heteroatom containing ring. For example, 1,2,3,4- tetraliydroquinoline having the formula: <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000013_0001"" />is, for the purposes of the present invention, considered a heterocyclic unit. 6,7-Dihydro-5H- cyelopentapyrimidine having the formula: <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000013_0002"" />is, for the purposes of the present invention, considered a heteroaryl unit. When a fused ring unit contains heteroatoms in both a saturated and an aryl ring, the ar l ring will predominate and determine the type of category to which the ring is assigned. For example, 1 ,2,3,4-tetrahydro- [l,8]naphthyridine having the formula:   <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000014_0001"" />    is, for the purposes of the present invention, considered a heteroaryl unit.      [0041] Whenever a term or either of their prefix roots appear in a name of a substituent the name is to be interpreted as including those limitations provided herein. For example, whenever the term ""alkyl"" or ""aryl"" or either of their prefix roots appear in a name of a substituent (e.g., aryialkyl, aikylamino) the name is to be interpreted as including those limitations given above for ""alkyl"" and ""aryl.""      [0042] The term ""substituted"" is used throughout the specification. The term ""substituted"" is defined herein as a moiety, whether acyclic or cyclic, which has one or more hydrogen atoms replaced by a substituent or several (e.g., 1 to 10) substituents as defined herein below. The substituents are capable of replacing one or two hydrogen atoms of a single moiety at a time. In addition, these substituents can replace two hydrogen atoms on two adjacent carbons to form said substituent, new moiety or unit. For example, a substituted unit that requires a single hydrogen atom replacement includes halogen, hydroxy!, and the like. A two hydrogen atom replacement includes carbonyl, oximino, and the like. A two hydrogen atom replacement from adjacent carbon atoms includes epoxy, and the like. The term ""substituted"" is used throughout the present specification to indicate that a moiety can have one or more of the hydrogen atoms replaced by a substituent.

PROCEDURES      [0159] The following procedures can be utilized in evaluating and selecting compounds as the pregenomic RNA encapsidation inhibitors of HBV.      [0160] The HBV replication inhibitors of the present invention are capable of treating and preventing diseases associated with HBV infection. The results presented in Tables 5 to 9 demonstrated that compounds of the present invention inhibit HBV replication in an immortalized murine hepatocyte (AML 12)-derived stable cell line (AML12HBV 10) that supports robust HBV replication in a tetracycline inducible manner without measurable cytotoxicity up to 50  by using the standard MTT assay (Promega).      [0161] The antiviral efficacy of the compounds of the disclosure, as presented in Tables 5, 6,     7, 8 and 9, were determined in AML12HBV10 cells. AML12HBV10 is an immortalized murine hepatocyte (AML 12)-derived stable cell line that supports robust HBV replication in a tetracycline inducible manner (Xu et a!.). The cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a density of 2 x 10<4> cells per well and cultured in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of tetracycline to allow pgRNA transcription and HBV DNA replication. One day after seeding, cells were left untreated or treated with a serial dilution of testing compounds, ranging from 50  to 0.39 , for     48 hours. Cells were then lysed by adding into each well of 100  lysis buffer containing 10 mM     Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl and 1% NP-40 and incubated at 37 C for 30   minutes. Half amount (50 ) of cell lysate from each well was combined with equal volume of denaturing solution containing 0.5N NaOH and 1.5M NaCl. After 5 minute incubation, 100  of neutralization solution (1M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5M NaCl) was added into each well. The denatured cell lysates (totally 200 ) were applied onto Nylon membrane using 96-well dot-blot manifold (Biorad), HBV DNA in the cell lysates were determined by dot-blot hybridization with alpha-^P- UTP-labelled rlboprohe specific for HBV minus strand DNA. The antiviral efficacy of a compound of the disclosure was expressed as the concentration that reduces the amount of HBV DNA by 50% (EC'so).      [0162] Determination of cytotoxicity of compounds of the disclosure in AML12HBV10 cells: To determine the cytotoxicity of the compounds, AML12HBV10 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 2 x 10<4> cells per well and cultured in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of tetracycline to allow pgR A transcription and HBV DNA replication. One day after seeding, cells were left untreated or treated with a serial dilution of testing compounds, ranging from 50  to 0.39 , for 48 hours. The cell viability was measured by a MTT assay, following procedure provided by the manufacturer (Promega). The cytotoxicity of a compound was expressed as the concentration of compound that reduces the viability of the cells by 50% (CC50).      [0163] Determination of antiviral activity of compounds of the disclosure, as presented in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Table 10, in human hepatoma-derived cell lines: To further confirm the antiviral activity of the compounds of the disclosure against HBV in human hepatocyte-derived cells, HepDE819 cells, a human hepatoma cell line supporting HBV replication in a tetracycline inducible manner (Guo et ai., 2007), seeded into 12-weil plates at a density of 5 x 10<""> cells per well and cultured in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum and I g ml tetracycline. Two days after seeding, the cells were mock-treated or treated with a serial dilution of compounds of the disclosure, ranging from 10 , to 0,018 , for 6 days in the absence of tetracycline. Upon the completion of treatment, cells were lysed by adding into each well of the 12-weil plates 0,5 mi of lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 % NP40 and 2% sucrose and incubating at 37C for 10 minutes. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was mixed with 130  of 35% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 containing 1 ,5 M NaCl, After 1 hour incubation in ice. viral nucleocapsids were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 X g for 5 min at 4C, followed by 1 hour digestion at 3TC in 400  of digestion buffer containing 0.5 mg ml pronase   (Calbiochem), 0.5% 5DS, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mM EDTA. The digestion mixture was extracted twice with phenol and DNA was precipitated with etbanol, dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.1 mM EDTA). One half of the DNA sample from each well was resolved by electrophoresis into a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was then subjected to denaturation in a solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCl, followed by neutralization in a buffer containing 1 M Tris-HCl (pH7.4) and 1.5 M NaCl. DNA was then blotted onto Hybond-XL membrane (OE Health care) in 20X SSC buffer. The amounts of cytoplasmic HBV core-associated HBV DNA were determined by Southern blot hybridization and the antiviral efficacy of a compound was expressed as its concentration that reduce the amount of HBV DNA by 50% (ECso) or 90% (EC*,).      [0164] Determination of cytotoxicity of compounds of the disclosure in human hepatoma- derived ceil lines, HepDES19 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 6 x 10<'*> cells per well and cultured in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of tetracycline. One day after seeding, cells were left untreated or treated with a serial dilution of testing compounds, ranging from 50  to 0.39 , for 6 days. The cell viability was measured by a MTT assay, following procedure provided by the manufacturer (Promega). The cytotoxicity of a compound was expressed as the concentration of compound that reduces the viability of the cells by 50% (CC50).      [0165] Antiviral efficacy of the selective compounds of the disclosure in HepDES 19 cells is presented in Figure. 1. A side-by-side comparison of the antiviral efficacy between DVR23 and two known anti-HBV compounds, lamivudine and Bay 1-41 9 is presented in Figure 2. A summary of the antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity of representative compounds of the disclosure in AML12HBV10 and HepDES19 cells is presented in Table 10. These results clearly demonstrate that the compounds of the disclosure selectively inhibit HBV replication not only in murine hepatocyte- derived cell line (AML12HBV 10), but also in human hepatocyte-derived cell Uine (HepDES l 9). The results also demonstrate that DVR-26 inhibits HBV DNA replication at a similar efficacy of lamivudine and Bay 41 -4109.      [0166]To obtain mechanistic insight of the compounds of present invention against HBV,     AML12HBV10 cells cultured in the 12-well plates were treated with a series of concentrations of     DVR-1 , DVR-56 or DVR-23 for two days in the absence of tetracycline (Guo et a!., 2007). As positive controls, the ceils were also treated with Bay41-4109 (5 iiM) or AT-61 (25 ), the known     HBV nucleocapsid assembly effectors that either bind to HBV core protein dimmer to misdirect its   interaction and prevent capsid formation (Bay41-4109) (Deres et al,, 2.003; Stray and Zlotnick, 2006), or interact with a core assembly intermediate and promote the formation of empty capsids (AT-63 ) (Feld et al., 2007; Katen et al, ; King et al., 1998). The amounts of intracellular viral mRNA, encapsidated pgRNA, capsids and nucleocapsid-associated HBV DNA were analyzed with the methods detailed below,      [0167] Procedure for analysis of HBV mRNA: Upon the completion of treatment, total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). Five micrograms of total RNA was resolved in 1.5% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formadelhyde and transferred onto Hybond-XL membrane in 20X SSC buffer. The amounts of HBV mRNA were determined by Northern blot hybridization with an alpha-""P-UTP labeled riboprobe specific for plus strand of HBV genome.      [0168]Determination of encapsidated pgRNA: AML12HBV10 cells were fysed by addition of 600  of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40) into each well of 12-well plates. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 5,000g for 10 minutes. One-half of the sample was mixed with 6 U of micrococcal nuclease (Pharmacia) and 15  of 100 mM CaCl2 and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 C to digest free nucleic acids. The reaction was stopped with 6  of 0.5 M EDTA, and capsids were precipitated by adding 125  of 35% polyethylene glycol 8000 in 1.75 M NaCl to the reaction and incubating in ice for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 6,000g for 10 minutes at 4 C. Pellets were re-suspended in 50  of TNE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). pgRNA was extracted by the addition of 1 ml of Trizol reagent. The encapsidated pgRNA were efectrophoresed through a 2.2 M formaldehyde- 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and immobilized by UV cross- linking (Stratagene). Hybridization was performed with an aipha-<"" '>P-UTP labeled riboprobe specific for plus strand of HBV genome,      [0169] Procedures of viral capsids and nucleocapsid-associated DNA analysis: HepDESi9 cells were lysed by addition of 300  buffer containing lOmM Tris-HCl (pH7.6), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% NP-40 to each well of 12-well plate. Cell debries were removed by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 minutes. Ten microliters of the clarified ceil lysates were fractionated by electrophoresis through nondenaturing 1% agarose gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter by blotting with TNE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.6; 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA). HBV capsids were detected by probing the membrane with an antibody against HBV core protein (DAKO). Bound antibody was revealed by IRDye secondary antibobies and visualized by Li-COR Odyssey system,   To detect capsid associated HBV DNA, the membrane were treated with buffer containing 0.5N NaOH and 1.5 M NaCI for 5 minutes and followed by neutralization with buffer containing 1 M TRIS-HCl and 1.5M NaCI for 5 minutes. The viral DNA was detected by hybridization with a a-<32>P- UTP (800Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer) labeled minus strand specific full-length HBV riboprobe (Xu et ai.).      [0170] To analyze the HBV DNA replication intermediates, cells were iysed by adding into each well of the 12-well plates 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 % NP40 and 2% sucrose and incubating at 37C for 10 minutes. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was mixed with 130  of 35% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 containing 1.5 M NaCI. After I hour incubation in ice, viral nucieocapsids were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 X g for 5 minutes at 4C, followed by 1 hour digestion at 37 C in 400  of digestion buffer containing 0.5 mg ml pronase (Calbiochem), 0.5% SDS, 150 mM NaCI, 25 mM Tris- HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mM EDTA. The digestion mixture was extracted twice with phenol and DNA was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 0.1 mM EDTA). One half of the DNA sample from each well was resolved by electrophoresis into a 1.5% agarose gel. The gel was then subjected to denatixration in a solution containing 0.5 M NaOH and 1.5 M NaCI, followed by neutralization in a buffer containing 1 M Tris-HCl (pH7.4) and 1.5 M NaCI, DNA was then blotted onto Hybond-XL membrane (GE Health care) in 20X SSC buffer. The HBV DNA replication intermediates were probed with an a1pba-""p~UTP labeled riboprobe specific for minus strand of HBV genome.      [0171JAs shown in Figure 3, DVR- 1, DVR- 56 and DVR-23 did not affect the amount of viral mRNA (panel A), but dose-dependently reduced the level of encapsidated pgRNA (Panel C). However, consistent with the proposed mechanism, particle gel assay reveled that Bay41 -41 9 treatment completely abolished capsid formation (panel B) and thus pgRNA encapsidation and DNA synthesis (panels C, D and E), AT-61 treatment did not affect capsid formation (panel B), but dose- dependently reduced the amounts of encapsidated pgRNA (panel C) and the capsid-associated HBV DNA (panels D and E). Similar to AT-61 , DVR compounds did not significantly affect capsid formation (panel B), but reduced encapsidated pgRNA and capsid-associated HBV DNA in a dose- dependent mariner (panels C, D and E). The above results imply that phenotypicaliy similar with AT- 61, the DVR compounds inhibited pgRNA encapsidateion into nucieocapsids and resulted in   formation of empty capsids. As a consequence, the subsequent HBV DNA replication could not occur.      ) by dot blot hybridization and cellular toxicity (CC50) of compound      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000048_0001"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000048_0003"" />    Table 6; Antiviral activity (EC50) by dot blot hybridization and cellular toxicity (CC5 ) of compounds of the formula (VI):      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000048_0002"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000048_0004"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000049_0001"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000050_0001"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000051_0001"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000052_0001"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000053_0001"" />    Table 7: Antiviral activity (EC5o) by dot blot hybridization and cellular toxicity (CCSo) of compounds of the formula (II): <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000053_0002"" />    <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000053_0003"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000054_0001"" />    Table 8: Antiviral activity (EC5o) by dot blot hybridization and cellular toxicity (CCSo) of compounds of the formula (ill): <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000054_0002"" />    <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000054_0003"" />DVR-08 CH3 44 >50      DVR-09 CH3 33 >50      DVR-10 H 49 >50      DVR-1 1 Br 13,2 >50      Table 9; Antiviral activity (EC50) by dot blot hybridization and cellular toxicity (CC50) of compounds of the formula (IV):      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000055_0001"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000055_0003"" />    Table 10: Antiviral activity of exemplary compounds of the formula (II) in AML12HBV10 and HepDES 19 cells:      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000055_0002"" />    AML12HBVI0 HepDES 19      Compound R<x>      EC50 CCso EC50 EC90 CCso  <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682681-imgf000056_0001"" />","                                                                                                                                                                        rowWHAT IS CLAIMED IS: row1 , A method for treating Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and related conditions, said method comprising administering to a subject an effective amount of at least one compound having formula (I): row<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682680-imgf000057_0001"" />row    1 is hydrogen; rowR<2> is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, trifluoromethyl, tluorine, and chlorine; rowR<3> is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, fluorine, and chlorine; rowR<4> is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, and methyl; rowR<'> is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen and chlorine; rowR' is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and bromine; rowR<s> is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, fluorine, and chlorine; row<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682680-imgf000057_0002"" />row    <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""113682680-imgf000058_0001"" />row    or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form thereof. rowThe method of claim 1, wherein the at least one compound is at least one selected from the group consisting of row2- Chloro-5-sulfamoyl-N-3-methylphenyl-benzar iide; row4- F1 uoro-3 -sulfam oyl-N -(3 -trif!

FIELD OF THE INVENTION     This invention relates to highly pure diphenyl sulfone, process for the production of such high purity solvent and its use in a method for the preparation of improved poly(aryl ether ketone) polymers by aromatic nucleophilic substitution. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION     Poly(aryl ether ketone) polymers (i.e., PAEK polymers) are a well known class of engineering polymers useful in various fields of endeavor whose structures combine both ether and ketone groups. Poly(etheretherketone)     (PEEK) and poly(etherketone) (PEK) are the most common PAEK. PEK and PEEK are high-strength, radiation-resistant engineering plastics, thermally stable and highly resistant to chemicals.     Processes for preparing these polymers can be found in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,953,400, 3,956,240, 3,928,295, and 4,176,222, all incorporated herein by reference. Generally, PAEK polymers are prepared by aromatic nucleophilic substitution. For example, a bisphenol can be used as a nucleophilic component which is deprotonated with a base such as NaOH, Na2CO3 or K2CO3. The resultant bisphenolate may then react with a bishalogenated monomer, e.g., a dihalobenzophenone such as difluorobenzophenone to form PEEK via nucleophilic substitution, with the halogen atoms of the dihalobenzophenone acting as leaving groups. For high temperature processes (i.e. requiring reaction temperatures higher than 250<0>C, more particularly more than 300<0>C), fluorine is the preferred halogen. Examples of fluorinated monomers are represented by structures 1 to 6 (4,4 '-difluorobenzophenone (1), l,4-bis(4'-fluorobenzoyl)benzene (2), 1,3- bis(4'-fluorobenzoyl)benzene (3), etc). Often, such PAEK reactions are carried out in a solvent that is, or that contains, diphenyl sulfone (DPS). For such high temperature processes, a high purity of solvent is required.     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000003_0001"" />(5)      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000004_0001"" />    To the best of the inventor's knowledge, only two documents pertain to the recovery of diphenyl sulfone in a polyether manufacturing process. In JP 2004/315764, diphenyl sulfone is recovered by precipitation. Besides, a low boiling organic solvent or a mixture of a low boiling organic solvent with water (homo- or heteroazeotrope) on one hand, and water on the other hand are recovered successively by distillation.     In JP 2007/238890, the addition of water is used to help remove low boiling solvent. The presence of high levels of inorganic salts increases the risk of corrosion of the equipment, especially at the high temperatures.     Because the most economically viable processes for manufacturing PAEKs typically involve a recycling of the reaction solvent comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of DPS, and given the difficulties of high temperature recovery/distillation/purification of DPS, a low temperature recovery operation (e.g., <150C, preferably < 70<0>C, more preferably below 65C), which preferably does not involve distillation of the DPS and which provides DPS of high purity is highly desirable. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION     Surprisingly, the inventors have found that certain impurities in diphenyl sulfone (DPS) have a deleterious effect on the properties of the PAEKs produced therein, including one or more of color, melt stability, molecular weight, crystallinity, etc. and here identify those impurities and provide processes for the removal of such impurities :     - from new or unused DPS (i.e., DPS not previously used in a PAEK reaction or in any other process or application, e.g., commercially available DPS), hereinafter ""virgin"" DPS, as well as     - from DPS previously used in PAEK manufacturing or some other process or application, hereinafter ""recovered/recycled/reused"" DPS or simply ""used"" DPS. - A -     The present invention is thus related to highly pure DPS.     The present invention is also related to a method for the production of such high purity solvent. In particular, the present invention concerns a method for isolating a solid diphenyl sulfone from a diphenyl sulfone solution obtained in the preparation of a poly(aryletherketone), wherein the diphenyl sulfone solubility in said solution is lowered at a level of at or below 1.5 wt. % by either : a) addition of a non solvent to the solution ; or b) addition of the solution to a non solvent ; or c) removal of a fraction of low boiling organic solvent present in the solution by a low temperature evaporation process, followed or preceded by addition of a non solvent to the solution ; or d) cooling the solution ; or e) a combination of two or more of a), b), c) and d). In the above method, the isolated solid diphenyl sulfone is preferably the diphenyl sulfone used in the method for the preparation of a poly(aryletherketone) (PAEK) as detailed hereinafter.     Another aspect of the present invention is related to a method for the preparation of a poly(aryletherketone) in a solvent comprising such highly pure DPS. In particular, the present invention concerns a method for the preparation of a poly(aryletherketone) by aromatic nucleophilic substitution in a solvent comprising a diphenyl sulfone, wherein said diphenyl sulfone meets at least one of the following impurity limitations :     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000005_0001"" />where ppm and wt. % are based on the total weight of the diphenyl sulfone and area % represents the ratio of the GC peak area of the impurity of concern over the total area of all GC peaks of the diphenyl sulfone. The diphenyl sulfone may comprise therein more than 0.03 area % of one or more oligo(aryl ether ketone) impurities, where area % represents the ratio of the LC peak area of the impurity of concern over the total area of all LC peaks of the diphenyl sulfone. The diphenyl sulfone may also comprise at least one fluorinated monomer, such as a fluorinated monomer selected from the group consisting of :     (1)     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000006_0001"" />and     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000006_0002"" />(6). The diphenyl sulfone meets preferably the impurity limitations for monomethyldiphenylsulfone, monochlorodiphenylsulfone, and residual acidity.     The diphenyl sulfone meets also preferably the impurity limitations for sodium, iron, diphenyl sulfide, and APHA of 20 wt. % solution in acetone at 25<0>C. Very preferably, it meets further the impurity limitation for potassium.     Preferably, the diphenyl sulfone meets further the following impurity limitation :     I Water content Less than 0.1 wt. % |     The so-prepared poly(aryletherketone) is preferably a poly(ether ether ketone). The so-prepared poly(aryletherketone), when compression molded at     370<0>C into a 2.5 mm thick compression molded plaque, has preferably the following L*, a*, b* values measured under a D65 light source at a 10 angle : L * > 90 -17 * (mt), a* is between -1 and +3 b* is between +5 and +20.     Still another aspect of the invention includes a poly(aryletherketone) prepared by a nucleophilic process in highly pure DPS. A related aspect of the invention concerns a poly(aryletherketone) obtainable by the method as above detailed. Additional aspects and other features of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from the practice of the present invention. The advantages of the present invention may be realized and obtained as particularly pointed out in the appended claims. As will be realized, the present invention is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the present invention. The description is to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The inventors have found that certain impurities in diphenyl sulfone (DPS) have a deleterious effect on the properties of the PAEKs produced therein. Therefore, the diphenyl sulfone according to the present invention contains a low level of such impurities and meets at least one of the following impurity limitations : <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000008_0002"" />where ppm and wt. % are based on the total weight of the diphenyl sulfone and area % represents the ratio of the GC peak area of the impurity of concern over the total area of all GC peaks of the diphenyl sulfone.     Such DPS is very useful in the manufacture of PAEK. The poly(aryletherketone)     The term ""poly(aryletherketone)"" (PAEK) as used herein includes any polymer of which more than 50 wt. % of the recurring units are recurring units (Rl) of one or more formulae containing at least one arylene group, at least one ether group (-O-) and at least one ketone group [-C(=O)-].     Preferably, recurring units (Rl) are chosen from :     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000008_0001"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000009_0001"" />wherein :     Ar is independently a divalent aromatic radical selected from phenylene, biphenylene or naphthylene,     X is independently O, C(=O) or a direct bond, n is an integer of from 0 to 3, b, c, d and e are 0 or 1 , a is an integer of 1 to 4, and preferably, d is 0 when b is 1.     More preferably, recurring units (Rl) are chosen from :     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000009_0002"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000010_0001"" />and<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000010_0002"" /><img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000011_0001"" />    Still more preferably, recurring (Rl) are chosen from     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000011_0002"" />and     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000011_0003"" />    The most preferably, recurring units (Rl) are     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000011_0004"" />    A PEEK polymer is intended to denote any polymer of which more than 50 wt. % of the recurring units are recurring units (Rl) of formula (VII). A PEK polymer is intended to denote any polymer of which more than 50 wt. % of the recurring units are recurring units (Rl) of formula (VI). The poly(aryletherketone) may be notably a homopolymer, a random, alternate or block copolymer. When the poly(aryletherketone) is a copolymer, it may notably contain (i) recurring units (Rl) of at least two different formulae chosen from formulae (VI) to (XXI), or (ii) recurring units (Rl) of one or more formulae (VI) to (XXI) and recurring units (Rl *) different from recurring units (Rl).     Preferably more than 70 wt. %, more preferably more than 85 wt. % of the recurring units of the poly(aryletherketone) are recurring units (Rl). Still more preferably, essentially all the recurring units of the poly(aryletherketone) are recurring units (Rl). The most preferably, all the recurring units of the poly(aryletherketone) are recurring units (Rl).     U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,953,400, 3,956,240, 3,928,295, and 4,176,222, and RE 34085, all incorporated herein by reference, also disclose PAEKs and methods for their preparation. As noted above, PAEK polymers are generally prepared by aromatic nucleophilic substitution. For example, a bisphenol can be deprotonated with a base such as NaOH, Na2CO3 or K2CO3 and the resultant bisphenolate may then react with a bishalogenated monomer, e.g., a dihalobenzophenone via nucleophilic substitution, to form a PAEK via nucleophilic substitution. Such PAEK reactions are typically carried out in a solvent that is, or that contains, diphenyl sulfone.     A dihalobenzophenone of particular interest, since it can be used to form PEEK via nucleophilic substitution (when it is reacted with the phenolate obtained by deprotonating p-hydroquinone), and also many other useful PAEKs [when it is reacted with other bisphenolates such those obtained by deprotonating 4,4'-biphenol, l,4-bis-(p-hydroxybenzoyl)benzene or l,3-bis-(p-hydroxybenzoyl)benzene)], is 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone. The Applicant has surprisingly found that, when 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone is used for preparing semi-crystalline poly(aryletherketone) in the process according to the present invention, improved results are obtained when     4,4'-difluorobenzophenone complies with certain impurity limitations. Embodiment (D)     Hence, in a particular embodiment (D) of the present invention, the invented method for the preparation of a poly(aryletherketone) is a method for the preparation of a semi-crystalline poly(aryl ether ketone) by aromatic nucleophilic substitution in a solvent comprising a diphenyl sulfone, wherein :     - said diphenyl sulfone meets at least one of the impurity limitations as described in the present document, and     - a nucleophile is reacted with a 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone, wherein the 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone meets the following impurity limitation :     [2,4'-difluorobenzophenone] + [4-monofluorobenzophenone] < 1250 ppm wherein the amounts of 2,4'-difluorobenzophenone and     4-monofluorobenzophenone in 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone are determined by liquid chromatography analysis.     For example, the liquid chromatography determination can be carried out with a Agilent 1100 LC High Pressure Liquid Chromatography instrument using a Supelco Discovery HS F5, 5m, 25cm x 4.6mm column. Suitable analysis conditions include :     Mobile Phase : acetonitrile/deionized water     Gradient : 60/40 acetonitrile/water for 5 minutes, increase to 100 % acetonitrile in a further 10 minutes.     Flow rate : 1 ml/minute     Detection : UV 254 nm     Temperature : 50<0>C     Injection Volume : 5l The sample is prepared by dissolving about 0.0 Ig of     4,4'-difluorobenzophenone in 100 ml of acetone.     The amount of 2,4'-difluorobenzophenone and     4-monofluorobenzophenone in 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone is typically determined using a calibration with three external standards of these commercially available compounds, of different concentrations, to generate a calibration curve. Under the above detailed conditions, the retention time of 2,     4'-DFBP is typically about 7.4 minutes and typically about 7.1 minutes for 4- monofluorobenzophenone, while the retention time for 4,4'-DFBP is typically about 7.7 minutes. Results are expressed as parts per million of the two impurities.     In present embodiment (D), preferably, the 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone further meets the following impurity limitation :     [2,4'-difluorobenzophenone] < 750 ppm, and, more preferably, it further meets at least one of the following sets of impurity limitations :     Set 1 : [2,4'-difluorobenzophenone] < 750 ppm, and     [4-monofluorobenzophenone] < 500 ppm,     Set 2 : [2,4'-difluorobenzophenone] < 300 ppm, and     [4-monofluorobenzophenone] < 950 ppm. PAEK polymers that were prepared in accordance with embodiment (D) exhibited improved properties, including improved chemical resistance, improved mechanical properties over a large temperature range, improved crystallinity and/or melt stability. The diphenyl sulfone     DPS that meets one or more of the specific impurity limits described herein, including DPS that meets one or more of the impurity limits described herein by having undergone a purification according to the invention, is called purified DPS or highly pure DPS.     In their preparation of highly pure DPS the inventors have determined that commercially available diphenyl sulfone contains several impurities, including monomethyldiphenylsulfone (several isomers), monochlorodiphenylsulfone (several isomers), sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, iron salts, water, sulfuric acid and benzene sulfonic acid.     In addition, when DPS is used in a manufacturing process for PAEK and is then recycled or reused, impurities that are generally present in DPS include : - low boiling extraction solvent(s) used during the polymer isolation process (e.g., acetone, methanol, ethanol, monochlorobenzene, xylene, etc) ;     - salts resulting from the manufacturing process (this includes the polymer isolation steps) : typically these can be sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, lithium fluoride, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate ;     - water ;     - organic or inorganic impurities arising form thermal degradation of diphenyl sulfone, including diphenyl sulfide, biphenyl, dibenzothiophene sulfone, benzene sulfinic acid, benzene sulfonic acid, biphenyl phenyl sulfone (several isomers), SO2 ;     - residual oligo(aryl ether ketone)s, mostly with fluorine, chlorine, hydroxyl end groups or with no end groups (cyclic) ;     - residual monomers, present either in their neutral form or in their ionized form (e.g. bisphenolate salt) ; - residual chemicals originating from the polymer purification process (e.g. inorganic acid like HCl).     Certain of these impurities have been identified as having a negative impact on the properties of the PAEKs obtained from regular (i.e. non purified) virgin or used DPS. Usually, the recovered DPS does contain some residual fluorinated monomer. Fluorinated monomer (1) to (6) are one of these impurities. The presence of fluorinated monomers (1) and (2) is preferred. Fluorinated monomer concentration is usually higher than 50 ppm and can be as high 5 wt. %. It is economically advantageous to maximize recycling of monomer.     Usually, the recovered DPS also contains impurities formed during the PAEK synthesis reaction. More particularly, the recovered DPS can contain residual oligo(aryl ether ketone)s. Oligo(aryl ether ketone)s found in recovered DPS result from the reaction of m molecules of fluorinated monomer with n molecules of bisphenols wherein m = n or n+1 and m < 5. Oligo(aryl ether ketone)s, which can be found in the recovered DPS, have thus generally a structure similar to PAEK produced, but with a lower degree of polymerization. Typically, the degree of polymerization is such that these oligo(aryl ether ketone)s are soluble in the low boiling solvent used for extraction. Preferably, these oligo(aryl ether ketone)s have a degree of polymerization of maximum 5, more preferably maximum 4, the most preferably maximum 3. Degrees of polymerizations of 1.5, 2.5 are also possible. Oligo(aryl ether ketone)s with a degree of polymerization higher than five can also be present in the recovered diphenyl sulfone. The degree of polymerization is the number of recurring units (Rl) in the molecule. Non integer numbers are used when one bifunctional monomer has reacted in excess of the other bifunctional monomer. Mostly the oligo(aryl ether ketone)s have exactly the same recurring unit (Rl) as the PAEK they are derived from but, in some instances, the oligo(aryl ether ketone)s can have a recurring unit different, formed by side-reactions during the polymerization reaction or during the DPS recovery process.     Usually, residual oligo(aryl ether ketone)s found in recovered DPS have either fluorine or chlorine end groups, hydro xyl or ionized end groups or no reactive end groups at all. The later oligo(aryl ether ketone)s with no reactive end groups include cyclic oligo(aryl ether ketone)s, oligo(aryl ether ketone)s featuring hydrogen end groups (-H) and oligo(aryl ether ketone)s featuring phenyl ether end groups (-0-Ph). The presence of certain specific oligo(aryl ether ketone)s have been identified as detrimental to the synthesis of PAEK. For example, oligo(aryl ether ketone)s with hydroxyl or ionized end groups tend to alter the color of recovered diphenyl sulfone, as measured by the color of a 20 % solution in acetone.     On the other hand, the Applicant has surprisingly found that the presence of oligo(aryl ether ketone)s with fluorine or chlorine end groups or cyclic oligo(aryl ether ketone)s has only very limited or even no negative effect at all. In particular, the Applicant has surprisingly found that the presence of cyclic oligo(aryl ether ketone)s has essentially no negative effect or no negative effect at all.     Then, if present, the oligo(aryl ether ketone)s are preferably present according to the following relationship : cyclic oligo(aryl ether ketone)s are preferred to oligo(aryl ether ketone)s featuring hydrogen end groups (-H) and oligo(aryl ether ketone)s featuring phenyl ether end groups (-0-Ph), which are preferred to oligo(aryl ether ketone)s featuring fluorine end groups, which are preferred to oligo(aryl ether ketone)s featuring chlorine end groups, which are preferred to oligo(aryl ether ketone)s featuring hydroxyl or ionized end groups. In other words, the DPS according to the present invention is preferably essentially free or free of oligo(aryl ether ketone)s with hydroxyl or ionized end groups.     Examples of oligo(aryl ether ketone)s that are often present in recovered DPS used to prepare PAEK of recurring unit (Rl) of formula (VII) are shown in structures (7) to (11). Oligo(aryl ether ketone)s (10) and (11) are typically     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000016_0001"" />(8) <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000017_0001"" />    The DPS according to the present invention, meeting at least one impurity limit (maximum allowable content/Purity Standard) set forth above, can thus comprise therein at least one oligo(aryl ether ketone), such as those described in formulae (7) to (11). The oligo(aryl ether ketone)s can be detected by LC as described in the examples. The amount of such oligo(aryl ether ketone)s is not limited, and can range for example from 0.03 area % to 3 area %, as measured in the examples. In particular, in recovered DPS used to prepare PAEK having recurring units (Rl) of formula (VII), the amount of such oligo(aryl ether ketone)s of formulae (7) to (11) can range from 0.03 area % to 3 area %, as measured in the examples. Area % represents the ratio of the LC peak area of the impurity of concern over the total area of all LC peaks of the DPS.     The DPS according to the present invention can comprise either more than 0.03 area % of one or more oligo(aryl ether ketone)s, or higher than 0.1 area %, or higher than 0.5 area %, or even higher than 1.0 area %, based on the total LC peak area of the diphenyl sulfone plus impurities. On the other hand, and to the extent that certain oligo(aryl ether ketone)s, such as oligo(aryl ether ketone)s with hydro xyl or ionized end groups, are detrimental to the synthesis of PAEK, it is beneficial to limit the amount of oligo(aryl ether ketone)s in general to an amount lower than 5 area %, more preferably lower than 4 area %, still more preferably lower than 3 area % and the most preferably lower than 2 area %.     On the other hand, since other oligo(aryl ether ketone)s have only very limited effect, essentially no effect or even no negative effect at all, such as the oligo(aryl ether ketone)s of formulae (7) to (11), the skilled person will advantageously spend no effort to remove specifically these oligo(aryl ether ketone)s. Thus, the DPS according to the present invention comprises preferably more than 0.03 area %, more preferably higher than 0.1 area %, still more preferably higher than 0.5 area %, and the most preferably higher than 1.0 area %, based on the total LC peak area of the diphenyl sulfone plus impurities, of one or more oligo(aryl ether ketone)s selected from the group consisting of cyclic oligo(aryl ether ketone)s, oligo(aryl ether ketone)s featuring hydrogen end groups (-H), oligo(aryl ether ketone)s featuring phenyl ether end groups (-0-Ph), and oligo(aryl ether ketone)s featuring fluorine end groups. In particular, the DPS according to the present invention comprises preferably more than 0.03 area %, more preferably higher than 0.1 area %, still more preferably higher than 0.5 area %, and the most preferably higher than 1.0 area %, based on the total LC peak area of the diphenyl sulfone plus impurities, of one or oligo(aryl ether ketone)s selected from the group consisting of oligo(aryl ether ketone)s of formulae (7) to (11), more particularly the group consisting of oligo(aryl ether ketone)s of formulae (7), (8) and (11). Besides, the DPS according to the present invention comprises preferably more than 0.01 area %, more preferably higher than 0.03 area %, still more preferably higher than 0.1 area %, and the most preferably higher than 0.3 area %, based on the total LC peak area of the diphenyl sulfone plus impurities, of one or more cyclic oligo(aryl ether ketone)s, in particular the cyclic oligo(aryl ether ketone)s of formulae (8) to (10), more particularly the cyclic oligo(aryl ether ketone) of formula (10). The amount of any oligo(aryl ether ketone) or of any group of oligo(aryl ether ketone) cited in the present paragraph may be either lower than 5 area %, or lower than 4 area %, or lower than 3 area %, or lower than 2 area %. The DPS according to the present invention, meeting at least one impurity limit (maximum allowable content/Purity Standard) set forth above, may comprise at least one low boiling extraction solvent. It contains preferably less than 1 wt. %, more preferably less than 0.5 wt. %, the most preferably less than 0.2 wt. % of such low boiling extraction solvent.     The DPS according to the present invention, meeting at least one impurity limit (maximum allowable content/Purity Standard) set forth above, may comprise at least one organic or inorganic impurities arising from thermal degradation of diphenyl sulfone. It contains preferably less than 3 area %, more preferably less than 2 area % of such impurities.     The present invention relates, in part, to the purification of DPS and the use thereof of the purified product. Diphenyl sulfone (DPS) is a high boiling solvent (b.p. = 389C under atmosphere pressure) with a high melting point (125-129C). Currently, the presence of certain impurities in DPS requires the use of special construction materials for the recovery operation or for storage in the molten stage to limit corrosion. Moreover, the present inventors have found that certain impurities in DPS have a deleterious effect on the properties of the PAEKs produced therein, including color, melt stability, molecular weight, crystallinity, etc., the extent of the impact of these impurities depending on the concentration at which the polymerization reaction is run. Preferably, the polymerization reaction is done with a ratio of DPS solvent to polymer made at least of 1.45 kg DPS/kg polymer made, more preferably at least of 1.50 kg/kg polymer made. Preferably, the amount of DPS solvent used is no more than 2.60 kg DPS/kg polymer. More preferably, the amount of DPS used is no more than 2.50 kg/kg polymer made.     After much study, it has been determined that both virgin and recovered/recycled/reused DPS, when purified to meet at least one, preferably two or more, and the most preferably all, of the following impurity limits (maximum allowable content/Purity Standard), avoid the problems identified above with regard to PAEK properties (the following Table of purity standards shows a maximum allowable level of the identified impurity, and a non- exhaustive list of PAEK properties affected) :     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000020_0001"" />These identified maximum allowable limits include the full range of values from zero to (and including) the maximum allowable content, and all values and subranges within this range as if written out. In the above Table and wherever present herein, ppm and wt. % are based on the total weight of the diphenyl sulfone (i.e. the 100 % pure DPS + all present impurities) and area % represents the ratio of the GC peak area of the impurity of concern over the total area of all GC peaks of the diphenyl sulfone. Generally chromatographic data is presented as a graph of detector response (y-axis) against retention time (x-axis). This provides a spectrum of peaks for a sample representing the analytes present in a sample eluting from the column at different times. Retention time can be used to identify analytes if the method conditions are constant. Also, the pattern of peaks will be constant for a sample under constant conditions and can identify complex mixtures of analytes. In most modern applications however the GC is connected to a mass spectrometer or similar detector that is capable of identifying the analytes represented by the peaks. The area under a peak is proportional to the amount of analyte present. By calculating the area of the peak using the mathematical function of integration, the concentration of an analyte in the original sample can be determined. In most modern systems, computer software is used to draw and integrate peaks. For organic impurities, for which more than one isomer is possible (monomethyldiphenylsulfone and monochlorodiphenylsulfone), the impurity requirement pertains to the total concentration of all the impurity isomers.     Monomethyldiphenylsulfone (sum of all isomers) is advantageously present in an amount of less than 0.2 area % (limitation ), preferably less than 0.18 area %, more preferably less than 0.14 area %, still more preferably less than 0.1 area % and the most preferably less than 0.08 area %.

Sodium is advantageously present in an amount of less than 55 ppm     (limitation ), preferably less than 50, more preferably less than 40, still more preferably less than 30 and the most preferably less than 25 ppm.     Potassium is advantageously present in an amount of less than 15 ppm (limitation ), preferably less than 14, more preferably less than 12, still more preferably less than 10 and the most preferably less than 8 ppm.     Iron is advantageously present in an amount of less than 5 ppm (limitation ), preferably less than 4, more preferably less than 3, still more preferably less than 2 and the most preferably less than 1 ppm.     Residual acidity is advantageously present in an amount of less than 2.0 eq/g (limitation ), preferably less than 1.8, more preferably less than 1.6, still more preferably less than 1.4 and the most preferably less than 1 eq/g.     Water is advantageously present in an amount of less than 0.1 wt. % (limitation ), preferably less than 0.09, more preferably less than 0.08, still more preferably less than 0.07 and the most preferably less than 0.06 wt. %. Diphenyl sulfide is advantageously present in an amount of less than 2 wt. % (limitation ), preferably less than 1.6, more preferably less than 1.2, still more preferably less than 0.8 and the most preferably less than 0.4 wt. %. The APHA value of 20 wt. % solution in acetone at 25C is s advantageously of less than 50 (limitation i), preferably less than 45, more preferably less than 40, still more preferably less than 35 and the most preferably less than 30.     Total chlorine content is advantageously of less than 120 ppm (limitation K), preferably less than 115, more preferably less than 110, still more preferably less than 105 and the most preferably less than 100 ppm.     In a preferred embodiment, the DPS is pure in a way such that it meets one or more of the following groups of several impurity limits (maximum allowable content/Purity Standard) noted above : 1.)Monomethyldiphenylsulfone (sum of all isomers), monochlorodiphenylsulfone (sum of all isomers), residual acidity, water 2.)sodium, iron, diphenyl sulfide, APHA of 20 wt. % solution in acetone at 25C 3.) sodium, potassium, iron, diphenyl sulfide, APHA of 20 wt. % solution in acetone at 25<0>C. In other words, the DPS according to the present invention meets preferably the above described  and  limitations, more preferably the above described ,  and  limitations, still more preferably the above described , ,  and  limitations. It meets also preferably the above described  and  limitations, more preferably the above described ,  and  limitations, still more preferably the above described , ,  and i limitations and the most preferably the above described , , , i and  limitations.     Also in a preferred embodiment, the DPS according to the invention has a minimal amount of diphenyl sulfide present ( limitation), yet meets the above impurity limit. The diphenyl sulfone according to the present invention contains preferably more than 0.0025, more preferably more than 0.005, still more preferably more than 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and the most preferably more than 0.2 wt. % diphenyl sulfide. On the other hand, it contains advantageously less than 2.0 wt. %, preferably less than 1.8, more preferably less than 1.6 still more preferably less than 1.4 and the most preferably less than 1.2 wt. % diphenyl sulfide. The DPS according to the present invention meets at least one of the above described  to  impurity limitations, it meets preferably at least two, more preferably at least three, still more preferably at least four and the most preferably at least five of the above described  to  impurity limitations. Excellent results were obtained when the DPS according to the present invention met almost all or even all the above described  to  impurity limitations.     The highly pure DPS according to the present invention may in fact be seen as a composition of matter comprising pure DPS and optionally one or more impurities. Accordingly, the GC chromatogram of the highly pure DPS according to the present invention comprise one major peak related to pure DPS and optionally one or more smaller peaks related to the optional one or more impurities.     Any method of solvent purification can be used in purifying virgin and used DPS so as to meet the above purity standard(s). Such techniques include distillation, liquid and gas chromatography, adsorption and/or absorption on silica or other solid media, ion exchange techniques, extraction, (re)crystallization, precipitation, etc. Combinations of such methods may be used. Those of ordinary skill in the art know how to measure, and are capable of measuring, the amount of the impurities noted above that are present in the purified DPS to determine whether the invention maximum allowable content of a given impurity has been met. Purifying used and virgin DPS using such techniques is a routine matter in the art, as is the measurement of the noted impurities. Thus, given the disclosure herein, one of ordinary skill can purify DPS according to the invention, can provide purified DPS, and can provide purified DPS meeting one or more of the above purity standards.     With regard to recovered/recycled/reused DPS that has been used in the preparation of a PAEK, the recovery of DPS according to the invention typically involves isolating DPS from a DPS mixture comprising at least one of the following : at least one low boiling organic solvent, water, one or more inorganic salts like chlorides, fluorides and carbonates, residual monomer(s), and residual oligo(aryl ether ketone)s. This DPS mixture is hereinafter termed a ""DPS solution"" or simply ""extract"". Typically, the water content in these extracts is between 0.5 and 15 wt. %.     In a typical example, a DPS extract is obtained in the preparation of a PAEK as follows. The reaction mixture, comprising DPS, PAEK, salts, fluorinated monomers, oligo(aryl ether ketone)s, etc, is solidified at the end of the polymerization reaction by cooling and ground to the target particle size. A preferred range of mean particle size (D50) is between 100 and 2500 m, and more preferably between 200 and 2000m. The reaction solvent, DPS, is then separated from the polymer by extraction with a low boiling organic solvent (acetone, methanol, ethanol, chlorobenzene, xylene or their mixtures). The low boiling organic solvent can be either virgin or recycled. Salts present in the reaction mixture are also partially extracted with the organic solvent, as well as DPS, fluorinated monomers and oligo(aryl ether ketone)s . These extracts also contain water, present in the low boiling solvent used for extraction and/or present in the reaction mixture as a result of a previous washing step with water. The extraction process can be carried out at room temperature or a temperature higher than room temperature, for instance at the boiling point of the low boiling organic solvent. The so-separated PAEK and salts may then be further washed with another solvent, water or mixtures thereof to extract remaining water, low boiling organic solvent, salts, chemicals...to finally lead to the obtention of the PAEK.     The invention low temperature processes for purifying DPS solution generally involve isolating solid diphenyl sulfone from the solution in which the diphenyl sulfone solubility is preferably at or below 1.5 wt. % at the temperature at which the purification is done, more preferably at or below 1.2 wt. %, still more preferably at or below 1 wt. %. In order to keep the organic impurities in solution, the solubility of the DPS is preferably at or higher than 0.02 wt. %, more preferably higher than 0.05, still more preferably higher than 0.08 and the most preferably higher than 0.12. Thus, DPS solubility in this solution is preferably 0.05 - 1.5 wt. %, including all values and subranges therebetween, such as 0.06, 0.1, 0.5, 0.55, 0.7, 0.9, 1.2, 0.6-1.3, etc. wt. %.     Different approaches can be used according to the invention, each one of them taken alone or in combination :     1. Addition of a non solvent to the solution, or more preferably, addition of the solution to a non solvent. A non solvent is a solvent in which DPS solubility is lower than 10 wt. %, typically less than 5 wt. % at the temperature at which the purification is operated. Non solvents include water, methanol, ethanol, etc and mixtures thereof. The ratio of the non solvent/solution is selected such that the final solubility of DPS is preferably below 1.5 wt. % at the purification temperature. This operation is preferably carried out under vigorous agitation. Examples of precipitation procedures and equipment, well known to the persons skilled in the art, can be found in ""Crystallization and Precipitation"", J. Mullin, ""Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry"", Online Ed. 2005.     2. Removal of a fraction of the low boiling organic solvent contained in the solution by a low temperature evaporation process (below 150<0>C, the actual temperature depends on the low boiling solvent boiling point. The evaporation step is advantageously done under subatmospheric pressure.), followed or preceded by a step of addition of a non solvent to reach the solubility limits outlined above (i.e., 0.05 - 1.5 wt. %). This can be done for example in an agitated vessel or other means known to the person skilled in the art. Examples of evaporation technology can be found in ""Evaporation"", R. Billet in ""Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry"", online Ed, 2005. In order to limit thermal degradation of organic impurities and corrosion of the equipment, a film evaporator is preferred for the low temperature evaporation process. An agitated thin film evaporator is specially preferred. Thin film evaporators present the advantages of low residence time and low wall temperature on the product side. Residence time depends on the separation to conduct. Residence time in thin film evaporators can be as low as fractions of seconds. Preferred residence time is shorter than 15 hours, preferably shorter than 10 hours. This can be carried out in a wiped- film evaporator, for example. Alternatively, the low temperature evaporation process can be accomplished under vacuum. More preferably, the low temperature evaporation process can be carried out in wiped- film evaporator operating under vacuum. 3. Cooling the solution to a temperature at which the solubility of DPS in the solution is less than 1.5 wt. %, preferably in the range of 0.05 wt. % - 1.5 wt. %. This is preferred when the solution is initially at a temperature higher than room temperature, for instance with low boiling organic solvents like chlorobenzene, p-xylene, etc. Of course, any combination of methods 1 to 3 may be used as well. The invention low temperature recovery operations described above are preferably carried out at temperatures of 150<0>C or less, more preferably 120<0>C or less, still more preferably 100<0>C or less and the most preferably 70<0>C or less, including 140, 130, 111, 100, 90, 65, 55, 45, 32, 25, 20, 10, 0, etc. <0>C and all values and subranges therebetween. The invention low temperature recovery operations described above are preferably carried out at temperatures above -10C, preferably above 0<0>C. The low temperature methods 1-3 preferably do not involve distillation of the DPS.     Another aspect of the present invention is thus related to a method for isolating a solid diphenyl sulfone from a diphenyl sulfone solution obtained in the preparation of a PAEK, wherein the diphenyl sulfone solubility in said solvent is lowered at a level of at or below 1.5 wt. % by either : a) addition of a non solvent to the solution ; or b) addition of the solution to a non solvent ; or c) removal of a fraction of low boiling organic solvent present in the solution by a low temperature evaporation process, followed or preceded by addition of a non solvent to the solution ; or d) cooling the solution ; or e) a combination of two or more of a), b), c) and d).     The solid DPS provided by the above methods can be separated from the solution by any method, including filtration, centrifuging, etc. The separation preferably is accomplished at 150<0>C or less, more preferably 120<0>C or less, still more preferably 100<0>C or less and the most preferably 70<0>C or less, including 140, 130, 111, 100, 90, 65, 55, 45, 32, 25, 20, 10, 0, etc. <0>C and all values and subranges therebetween. The separation is preferably carried out at temperatures above -10<0>C, preferably above 0<0>C. The solid DPS obtained may contain unreacted bishalogenated monomer (see examples of structures on page 2), for instance 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone or     1 ,4-bis(4'-fluorobenzoyl)benzene, 1 ,3-bis(4'-fluorobenzoyl)benzene monomer depending on the content in the DPS solution and the method chosen. It is economically advantageous to be able to recycle a fraction of unreacted fluorinated monomer.     The solid DPS obtained may contain the above described oligo(aryl ether ketone)s.     After this separation the isolated DPS solid can be further purified if desired. Since the most corrosive impurities have been removed at this stage, this secondary purification can be performed at high temperature or a at low temperature, for example by washing with a non solvent, dissolution in a solvent a high temperature and recrystallization at low temperature, distillation preferably under vacuum, etc. According to the invention, when a PAEK polymer is made in purified     DPS the polymer prepared typically has a molecular weight useful industrially, e.g., intrinsic viscosity int > 0.62 dl/g in methanesulfonic acid at 30<0>C, and a low color. The color is generally characterized by L*, a*, b* values, which are tristimulus coordinates defined by the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) in 1976 (K. Nassau, in ""Kirk-Othmer Encylopedia of Chemical Technology"", 2004, Chapter 7, P 303-341). These three basic coordinates represent the lightness of the color (L*, L* = 0 yields black and L* = 100 indicates white), its position between red/magenta and green (a*, negative values indicate green while positive values indicate magenta) and its position between yellow and blue (b*, negative values indicate blue and positive values indicate yellow). L* is measured according to ASTM E308 using D 65 illuminant.     The PAEK polymer made in purified DPS according to the invention has a color, as defined in USSN 60/955,042, incorporated herein by reference, i.e., a compression molded plaque (2.5 mm thick obtained by compression molding at 370<0>C) has the following L*, a*, b* values measured under D65 light source at 10 angle :     L * > 90 -17 * (mt), preferably L* > 95 -17 * (mt) a* is between -1 and +3 b* is between +5 and +20.     In a preferred embodiment herein, the DPS of the invention, meeting at least one impurity limit (maximum allowable content/Purity Standard) set forth above, comprises therein at least one fluorinated monomer, preferably a fluorinated monomer useful in the preparation of PAEKs, such as 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone monomer, 1 ,4-bis(4'-fluorobenzoyl)benzene, l,3-bis(4'-fluorobenzoyl)benzene, etc. Said fluorinated monomer is preferably selected from the group consisting of the above described formulae (1) to (6). The amount of such monomer(s) is not limited, and can range from, e.g., 0.005 - 5 wt. %, including both more and less than these endpoints, and all amounts in-between this exemplary range. The amount of residual fluorinated monomer can be determined by gas chromatography (GC) or by liquid chromatography (LC), as described in the examples below. The DPS according to the present invention comprises preferably more than 0.005 wt. %, more preferably more than 0.05 wt. %, still more preferably more than 0.5 wt. % and the most preferably more than 1 wt. % of such monomers. On the other hand, it comprises preferably less than 5 wt. %, more preferably less than 4.5 wt. %, still more preferably less than 4 wt. % and the most preferably less than 3.5 wt. %. In a preferred embodiment herein, the DPS of the invention, meeting at least one impurity limit (maximum allowable content/Purity Standard) set forth above, comprises therein at least one oligo(aryl ether ketone), such as those described in figures (7) to (11). The oligo(aryl ether ketone)s can be detected by LC as described in the examples. The amount of such oligo(aryl ether ketone)s is not limited, and can range for example from 0.03 area % to 3 area %, as measured in the examples. Preferably the amount of oligo(aryl ether ketone)s is higher than 0.03 area %, more preferably higher than 0.1 area %, still more preferably higher than 0.5 area % and the most preferably higher than 1.0 area %. On the other hand, the amount of oligo(aryl ether ketone)s is preferably lower than 5 area %, more preferably lower than 4 area %, still more preferably lower than 3 area % and the most preferably lower than 2 area %.     Another aspect of the present invention is related to a method for the preparation of a poly(aryl ether ketone) in a solvent comprising the above described DPS according to the present invention. A related aspect of the present invention concerns the use of the above highly pure DPS in a method for the manufacture of a PAEK.     PAEK can be prepared from a variety of starting materials, either via a nucleophilic route or an electrophilic route. One well known in the art nucleophilic method comprises reacting a generally substantially equimolar mixture of at least one bisphenol and at least one dihalobenzoid compound (for the two-monomer route) or at least one halophenol compound (for the one- monomer route). This nucleophilic route is generally carried out in DPS in the presence of alkali-metal carbonate, often under an inert atmosphere and often at temperatures approaching the melting point of the polymer. The alkali-metal carbonate includes preferably particulate sodium carbonate having a certain particle size distribution, as specified in embodiment (E) hereinafter. Embodiment (E)     In a preferred embodiment (E) of the present invention, the method for the preparation of a poly(aryletherketone) is a method by aromatic nucleophilic substitution :     - in a solvent comprising a diphenyl sulfone, wherein said diphenyl sulfone meets at least one of the above specified impurity limitations, and     - in the presence of particulate sodium carbonate, wherein said particulate sodium carbonate has a particle size distribution as follows :     D90 > 45 m and D90 < 250 m and D99.5 < 710 m. As used herein, a sodium carbonate particle size distribution expressed as Dxx < Y m refers to the percentage (xx %) of sodium carbonate particles by weight in a sample that are less than or equal to Y m in diameter.     On one hand, in accordance with embodiment (E), Na2CO3 that is ""too fine"" is avoided as it can notably lead to a low bulk density product that is difficult to handle and synthesis reaction kinetics that are difficult to control. With this regard, the Applicant found that Na2CO3 with a D90 > 45 m was beneficial.     On the other hand, in accordance with embodiment (E), Na2CO3 that contains a certain amount of ""big"" particles, and especially of ""very big"" particles (i.e., typically of about 710 m or more), is also to be avoided as it can notably slow down the polymerization rate, or require the use of an undesirably high amount OfK2CO3 or other higher alkali metal carbonate (at fixed Na2CO3 amount) ; Na2CO3 that contains a certain amount of ""big"" particles, and especially of ""very big"" particles, can also result in polymerizations having poor kinetics consistency. With this regard, the Applicant found that Na2CO3 with a D90 < 250 m and with a D99.5 < 710 m was also beneficial.     The use of particulate sodium carbonate in accordance with embodiment (E) provides several benefits, including the ability to synthesize easily PAEKs in the absence of a cosolvent forming an azeotrope with water such as p-xylene, and thereby prepare PAEKs with no trace of residual cosolvent (such cosolvents, like p-xylene, are generally toxic). Cosolvents forming an azeotrope with water used in the synthesis of PAEK resins are known to those of skill in the art, and in addition to p-xylene include chlorobenzene, toluene, etc. The use of particulate sodium carbonate in accordance with embodiment (E) makes it also possible to manufacture lower color, whiter PAEK resins. The use of particulate sodium carbonate in accordance with embodiment (E) results also beneficially in improved kinetics consistency.     Preferably, the D99.5 of the sodium carbonate particles in accordance with embodiment (E) is of at most 630 m ; more preferably, it is of at most 500 m ; still more preferably, it is of at most 425 m ; most preferably, it is of at most 355 m.     Preferably, the D90 of the sodium carbonate particles in accordance with embodiment (E) is of at least 63 m ; more preferably, it is of at least 90 m ; still more preferably, it is of at least 112 m. Preferably, the D90 of the sodium carbonate particles in accordance with embodiment (E) is of at most 212 m ; more preferably, it is of at most 180 m ; still more preferably, it is of at most 150 m.     In certain preferred sub-embodiments of embodiment (E), the sodium carbonate has the following particle size distributions :     - D99.5  630 m, D90 < 212 m, and D90 > 45 m ; or     - D99.5 < 500 m, D9o < 212 m, and D9o > 45 m ; or     - D99.5 < 425 m, D90 < 212 m, and D90 > 45 m ; or     - D99.5  630 m, D9o < 180 m, and D9o > 45 m ; or - D99.5 < 500 m, D90 < 180 m, and D90 > 45 m ; or     - D99.5  425 m, D9o < 180 m, and D9o > 45 m ; or     - D99.5  630 m, D90 < 212 m, and D90 > 63 m ; or     - D99.5 < 500 m, D9o < 212 m, and D9o > 63 m ; or     - D99.5  425 m, D90 < 212 m, and D90 > 63 m ; or - D99.5 < 630 m, D9o < 212 m, and D9o > 90 m ; or     - D99.5 < 500 m, D90 < 212 m, and D90 > 90 m ; or     - D99.5 < 425 m, D90 < 212 m, and D90 > 90 m.     The particle size distribution of the sodium carbonate in accordance with embodiment (E) can be determined by mechanical sieving. This method is appreciated because of its easiness, broad availability, and excellent repeatability. Mechanical sieving is generally based on the mechanical separation of the various fractions on a series of superimposed sieves. The analysis can be made partly or fully in accordance with ASTM E 359-00 (reapproved 2005)<e l>, the whole content of which being herein incorporated by reference. ASTM E 359-00 (reapproved 2005)<e l> concerns various measurements made specifically on sodium carbonate, notably sieve analysis. The particle size distribution is advantageously determined with an automatic mechanical sieving device, such as Ro-Tap RX-29 sieve shaker (as commercialized by W. S. Tyler Company). The sieves mounted on the sieve shaker are advantageously in conformity with standard ISO 3310 -1 or ASTM E-I l, preferably with wire stainless steel circular sieves with square meshes, metal mounting with a diameter 200 mm. The device and its sieves are advantageously checked periodically using a reference powder ; the control frequency should be desirably be as high as possible for early detection of any deviation, as possibly resulting for damaged meshes. Typically, it is proceeded as follows : the sieves are superimposed and assembled from top to bottom by descending order of opening mesh ; a fixed weight amount of the powder to be investigated is weighed with an analytical balance and placed on top of the widest sieve ; by vibrating the sieving machine, the powder material is conveyed through the various sieves ; the sieving operation is run for a fixed amount of time ; the residues on the sieves are weighed with an analytical balance and related mathematically to the initial weight of material. Notably D90 and D99.5 values can be calculated from the residues weights. This calculation is generally made as follows :     1) Calculate the weight percentage of the test specimen retained on each sieve     2) Express the weight percentage passing through each sieve, and cumulated The results can be displayed on a graph were the Y-coordinate represents the cumulative weight percent particles retained on a particular sieve. The X- coordinate corresponds to sieve size. The Y-value for a particular sieve can be determined by adding the weight of the particles retained on that sieve plus the weights of the particles retained on all larger sieves above it and dividing the sum by the total weight of the sample.     The sieves can be ISO 3310-1 or ASTM E-I l test sieves having a diameter of 200 mm, notably commercialized from LAVAL LAB Inc. A certain suitable set of sieves is composed of eight ISO 3310-1 or ASTM E-I l test sieves having a diameter of 200 mm, having the following aperture size or ASTM opening designation : 1000 m (ASTM No. 18), 500 m (ASTM No. 35), 250 m     (ASTM No. 60), 180 m (ASTM No. 80), 125 m (ASTM (No. 120), 90 m (ASTM No. 170), 63 m (ASTM No. 230) and 45 m (ASTM No. 325).     At the end of the sieving analysis, the weight fraction caught on each screen can be calculated. O1., the fraction on sieve i, of size X1, is thus :     wherein W1 is the weight of powder collected on sieve i sample weight The percentage under the size xt Pt is thus defined as :     P, =.     To obtain the cumulative curve, Pt, the percentage under the size xt can be plotted versus xt. The curve can be built by considering in each point the following slope :<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000031_0001"" />3) Determine Dz values (0<z<100), e.g. determine D90 and D99.5     Dz is defined as the abscissa of the curve for P = z/100, i.e. z wt. % of the sample is under the size of Dz.     D90 is defined as the abscissa of the curve for P = 0.90, i.e. 90 wt. % of the sample is under the size of D90.     D99.5 is defined as the abscissa of the curve for P = 0.995, i.e. 99.5 wt. % of the sample is under the size of D99.5.     Exemplary method for measuring the particle size distribution, in particular the<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""006667034-imgf000032_0001"" />Apparatus :     - Mechanical sieving apparatus able to transmit combined movements in the horizontal plane and shocks along the vertical axis to a pile of superimposed sieves (apparatus used : RO-TAP RX-29 Model or equivalent, with 278 horizontal revolutions and 150 taps per minute) - Series of circular sieves, wire stainless steel with square meshes, metal mounting with a diameter 200 mm, in conformity with NF ISO 3310 -1 standard and periodically checked using a reference powder.     Sieves superimposed by descending order of opening mesh (size in m) : 1000 m, 500 m, 250 m, 180 m, 125 m, 90 m, 63 m and 45 m. - Analytical balance, accuracy 0.01 g. Method :     - Test Specimen : 70 g of powder weighed to 0.0 Ig.     - Transfer the test specimen on the pile of sieves and position it in the apparatus     - Sieve for 15 minutes. - Weigh the content of each sieve to 0.0 Ig. Calculation :     Calculate the weight percentage of the test specimen retained on each sieve.     Express the weight percentage passing through each sieve, and cumulated. Determine by graphical interpolation the mesh opening equivalent to the 90 % and 99.5 % cumulated weight percentage (D90, D99.5).     The particle size distribution of the sodium carbonate used in accordance with embodiment (E) is advantageously determined on a sample which is representative of the whole sodium carbonate which is used in said process. To achieve appropriate sampling, the skilled person will advantageously rely upon all those sampling recommendations which do form part of the general knowledge and are broadly described in various encyclopedias, including but not limited to ""Sampling"", Reg. Davies, in ""Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology"", online Ed. 2000, the whole content of which is herein is incorporated by reference. Since sodium carbonate can be viewed as a free- flowing powder, sampling procedures suitable for stored free-flowing powders will be used preferably.     Sodium carbonate is broadly commercially available, either in the form of dense sodium carbonate or light sodium carbonate. Light sodium carbonate, also called light soda ash, has generally a free flowing density, as measured in accordance with ISO 903 standard, of between 0.48 kg/dm<3> and 0.65 kg/dm<3>. Dense sodium carbonate, commonly called dense soda ash, has generally a free flowing density, as measured in accordance with ISO 903 standard, of from 0.90 kg/dm<3> to 1.20 kg/dm<3>. In general, neither the commercially available dense sodium carbonates nor the commercially available light sodium carbonates have a particle size distribution as required by embodiment (E). Yet, as will explained below, it is easy for the skilled person, searching for obtaining a sodium carbonate with the appropriate particle size requirements, to obtain it.     Dense sodium carbonates having the particle size distribution as required by present embodiment (E) can be notably obtained by appropriate grinding and/or sieving dense sodium carbonates having a particle size distribution not in accordance with embodiment (E). Insofar as dense sodium carbonates are concerned, methods including at least one grinding step followed by at least one sieving step are preferred. As suitable grinders, it can be notably cited jet mills such as helical jet mills, oval tube jet mills, counterjet mills, fluidized bed jet mills, and ball and plate jet mills, can notably be used. As suitable sieves, it can be notably cited 710 m, 630 m, 500 m, 400 m, 300 m, 250 m, 200 m, 150 m and 125 m sieves.     Light sodium carbonates having the particle size distribution as required in present embodiment (E) can also be obtained by appropriate grinding and/or sieving light sodium carbonates having a particle size distribution not in accordance with embodiment (E). However, insofar as light sodium carbonates are concerned, methods free of any grinding step are preferred ; such methods may include a sieving step or not. A particularly preferred method for obtaining light sodium carbonates having the particle size distribution in accordance with embodiment (E) comprises selecting said light sodium carbonates among different lots of one or more grades of commercially available light sodium carbonates, as detailed below. The Applicant determined the particle size distribution of numerous lots of commercially available (unground) light sodium carbonates from different sources, and observed that, among all these lots, none had a D90 below 45 m ; as a matter of fact, their D90 often ranged usually from about 100 m to about 250 m, i.e. the lots often complied with both requirements set forth for the D90 in accordance with embodiment (E) of the present invention. Concerning the D99.5 of the commercially available light sodium carbonates, the Applicant observed surprisingly that its variability from one lot to another was very high, including when considering lots produced at relatively short intervals of time by the same manufacturer in the same plant ; it deduced wisely therefrom that this variability could be exploited to its own benefit, because, among the lots produced, certain had the appropriate particle size requirements, while certain other lots of the same commercial grade had a D99.5 above 710 m, not in accordance with embodiment (E) of the present invention. Among the tested sodium carbonates, SOD ASOLV AY<> L sodium carbonate, as produced notably in Dombasle or Rosignano plants, is particularly attractive because a rather high fraction of this commercial grade is formed by lots in accordance with the invention ; thus, the Applicant could very easily identify appropriate lots suitable for use in accordance with embodiment (E) of the present invention.     An important and surprising benefit resulting from the use of sodium carbonate powder meeting the requirements of embodiment (E) is that it allows one to limit the amount of potassium carbonate, and more generally of any other higher alkali metal carbonate, to be used in the preparation of the PAEK. As higher alkali metal carbonates other than potassium carbonate, it can be particularly cited rubidium carbonate and caesium carbonate.     Thus, in accordance with embodiment (E), the molar ratio of A/Na (wherein A designates either K, Cs or Rb or any combination thereof) can be of at most 0.050 mol A/mol Na, preferably at most 0.020 mol A/mol Na, and more preferably at most 0.010 mol A/mol Na. In an especially surprising particular sub-embodiment, the molar ratio of A/Na is equal to 0 (i.e. the nucleophilic substitution takes place in the absence of K, Cs and Rb). In another sub- embodiment, the molar ratio of A/Na, although being maintained at a low level (e.g. in accordance with the above specified upper limits), is above 0, preferably of at least 0.001 mol A/mol Na, more preferably of at least 0.002 mol A/mol Na and still more preferably of at least 0.003 mol A/mol Na. Unlike the particle size distribution of the sodium carbonate, the particle size distribution of the potassium carbonate, when present, is not important, although a slight additional improvement in terms of polymerization kinetics might be observed when using a very finely ground potassium carbonate. Still another aspect of the present invention is related to a PAEK obtainable by the above described method.     In a particular sub-embodiment of embodiment (E), the method for the preparation of a poly(aryletherketone) meets further the technical limitations as met in accordance with previously described embodiment (D). The PAEK is preferably PEK or PEEK.

EXAMPLES     As noted above, those of ordinary skill in the art know how to measure, and are capable of measuring, the amount of the impurities noted above that are present in DPS to determine whether the invention maximum allowable content of a given impurity is met. However, where there is a conflict in measurement methods, the following methods control. Analysis of acidity or basicity in diphenyl sulfone     Approximately 3 g of diphenyl sulfone sample was weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg and added to an empty glass titration vessel. 55 ml of high-purity methylene chloride was added, followed by addition of a 5.00 ml aliquot of spiking solution, which contains six drops of 37 % hydrochloric acid per liter, into the same titration vessel. The vessel was then attached to the titrator cell assembly containing the buret tip, pH electrode, and magnetic stirrer. The vessel was then purged with carbon dioxide-free nitrogen for 5-7 minutes. While continuing the nitrogen purge, the vessel contents were titrated with 0.025 N tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in 1 : 12 methanol:toluene and the volume of titrant required to reach the strong acid endpoint was measured. A blank titration was performed using the same parameters, except that the sample was omitted. Results were calculated using the following equation : Acidity = ((VSl-VBl)*N*100000)/W in microequivalents per gram of sample     Where VSl is the amount of titrant in ml required to reach the strong acid/base equivalence points when sample solution is titrated and VBl is the amount of titrant in ml required to reach the strong acid/base equivalence point when only the blank solution is titrated, W is the sample weight, and N is the normality of the tetrabutylammonium hydroxide titrant. If acidity is negative, the sample contains basic species.     Determination of sodium, potassium, and iron in diphenyl sulfone Concentrations of sodium, potassium, and iron were measured in diphenylsulfone by ashing of the sample followed by measurement of element concentration by inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry.     Approximately 3 g of diphenylsulfone sample was weighed into platinum crucibles using an analytical balance. Two drops of concentrated, trace metals grade sulfuric acid was added to each sample and the crucibles were placed into a muffle furnace set to 250 <0>C. After the diphenylsulfone has vaporized, the furnace temperature was raised to 525 <0>C for 1 hour to remove any organic residues. Metallic residues were dissolved by adding 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the crucible and warming at 50 <0>C to dissolve the ash. After addition of 5 ml of deionized water and additional warming, crucible contents were quantitatively transferred to a 25 -ml volumetric flask, diluted to the mark with deionized water, and mixed well. The diluted solutions were then analyzed by ICP-AES against standards made from certified sodium, potassium, and iron standard solutions. Emission was monitored at the following wavelengths for the elements of interest : sodium : 589.592 nm, potassium : 766.490 nm and iron : 238.204 nm. Plasma conditions used for the analysis were : plasma input power : 1300 watts, plasma argon flow : 15 liters per minute, auxiliary argon flow : 0.5 liters per minute, nebulizer flow : 1.2 liters per minute, and sample flow rate : 1.5 milliliters per minute. Element concentrations in the samples were calculated by the ICP operating software from the element emission line intensities. Determination of total chlorine in diphenyl sulfone     Using forceps, a clean, dry combustion boat was placed onto a microbalance, and the balance was zeroed. 1 mg of diphenylsulfone sample was weighed into the boat and weight was recorded to 0.001 mg. The combustion boat and sample were placed in the introduction port of a Thermo Electron Corporation ECS 1200 Halogen Analyzer, and the port was capped. The sample weight was entered into the sample weight field on the instrument computer. The sample analysis cycle was then started. The sample was burned in a mixture of argon and oxygen and the combustion products were carried by the combustion gas stream into a titration cell. Hydrogen chloride produced from the combustion was absorbed into the cell solution from the gas stream, and was coulometrically titrated with silver ions. Total chlorine content was displayed at the end of the titration. Determination of water in diphenyl sulfone     Water content in diphenyl sulfone was determined according to ASTM D6869-03 (Karl Fisher), with the following parameters : Purge oven temperature : 100<0>C Purge time : 1800 seconds Sample weight : Ig weighed to 0.000 Ig     Calibration : pure water (micro-capillary method in this method) Carrier gas : argon dried with molecular sieve 4 A Carrier gas flow rate : 100 ml/min.     The water in the vapors was analyzed by Karl Fisher volumetric titration. Determination of the concentration of diphenylsulfide, residual fluorinated monomer and oligo(aryl ether ketone)s in diphenylsulfone by liquid chromatography     HPLC analysis was carried out on a Waters Alliance 2795 LC instrument using a Supelco Discovery HS F5 25cm x 4.6mm column. The analysis conditions were :     Mobile phase : acetonitrile/deionized water.     Gradient : 60/40 acetonitrile/water, hold for 5 minutes, increase to 100 % acetonitrile in further 10 minutes, hold for 5 minutes at 100 % acetonitrile Flow rate : 1 ml/minute     Injection volume : 10 l     Detection : UV at 254 nm     The sample was prepared by dissolving 0.2g of DPS in 1Og of acetonitrile.     The concentration of diphenyl sulfide and of residual monomer was determined using a low concentration diphenyl sulfide and monomer standards as an external calibration standards (commercially available). The retention time for DPS was 6.2 minutes and the retention time for diphenyl sulfide was 10.7 minutes.     The retention time for 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone was 9.1 minutes. The retention times of oligo(aryl ether ketone)s such as those depicted in figures (7), (8) and (11) are 15.3, 18.0 and 15.1, minutes. They were identified by LC-MS     (liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry). Their concentration in the DPS sample was assessed by the area of these peaks /total peak area of DPS plus impurities.     Determination of monochlorodiphenylsulfones and monomethyldiphenylsulfones in diphenyl sulfone by gas chromatography GC analysis was performed on an HP5890 series 11 gas chromatograph using a Restek RTx-5MS, 15m x 0.25mm internal diameter x 0.25m film thickness column. The following GC conditions were used :     Helium flow rate : 1 ml/minute, Injector temperature : 250<0>C     FID temperature : 250<0>C     Oven Temperature Program : 100<0>C, hold 1 minute, 30C/minute to 250<0>C, hold 1 minute     Total run time : 14 minutes Injection volume : ll     Split 40:1 The sample was prepared by dissolving 0.2g of DPS in 5 ml of acetone. The GC retention times for mono methyl diphenylsulfone isomers were 8.0 and 8.1 minutes and for monochlorodiphenylsulfone 8.2 minutes. The identity of the impurities was determined by GCMS run on the sample solution. The impurity concentrations were quoted as area %, calculated from GC FID peak areas. When several isomers were present, the concentration includes the sum of these isomers. Determination of color (APHA) of DPS in acetone     20 g of diphenyl sulfone are dissolved in 80 g of acetone at 25C. The acetone used contains less than 0.5 wt. % water.     Color of the solution is measured as compared to Pt-Co standards in the APHA scale (ASTM D 1209-00), using a Gretag Macbeth Color Eye Ci5 Spectrophotometer for the comparison. The blank used was distilled water. Color measurement of final polymer     The color of a molded plaque (2.5 mm thick obtained by compression molding at 370C/19.4 bar/15 minutes then 370C/26.1 bar/5 minutes. To ensure full crystallization, the plaque was slowly cooled down to room temperature over 40 minutes) was measured under D65 light source at 10 angle (1964 CIE). Color measurements are expressed with L*, a*, b* tristimulus coordinates defined by the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) in 1976 (K. Nassau, in ""Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology"", 2004, Chapter 7, P 303-341). All measurements were made on Gretag Macbeth Color Eye Ci5 Spectrophotometer, with tribeam diffuse/8"" 6"" sphere optical geometry, a bandpass of 10 nm, a spectral range of 360 nm to 750 nm. Plaques were measured directly on the spectrometer eye and only one reading was taken. The illuminant was D65 (natural daylight). L*, a*, b* were measured according to ASTM E308-06. No bandpass correction was applied. Intrinsic viscosity Intrinsic viscosities were measured at 30<0>C in anhydrous methane sulfonic acid using a Cannon-Fenske viscometer tube (No. 50). The average of inherent viscosities and reduced viscosities extrapolated to zero concentrations was used. Reaction examples 1 through 11     Diphenyl sulfone used in these examples was supplied by different companies : Proviron (Belgium), Sloss (US), Wuhan Zhengmao (China) and used without further purification. The analysis of these samples was carried out per the analysis methods described.     In a 500 ml 4-neck reaction flask fitted with a stirrer, a N2 inlet tube, a Claisen adapter with a thermocouple plunging in the reaction medium, and a Dean-Stark trap with a condenser and a dry ice trap were introduced 127.82 g of diphenyl sulfone of quality defined hereafter in table 1, 28.5983 g of p-hydroquinone (p-hydroquinone can typically contain up to 0.6 % water - the weight here is the weight of p-hydroquinone on a dry basis, i.e. after correction for the moisture content), and 57.2337 g of 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (containing 2,4'-difluorobenzophenone and 4-monofluorobenzophenone in a cumulated amount of at most 1250 ppm).     Reaction examples 3 and 4 were run under more dilute conditions, with 175.00 g of diphenyl sulfone, instead of 127.82 g. The flask content was evacuated under vacuum and then filled with high purity nitrogen (containing less than 10 ppm O2). The operation was repeated twice. The reaction mixture was then placed under a constant nitrogen purge (60 ml/min).     The reaction mixture was heated slowly to 150<0>C. At 150<0>C, a mixture of 28.4259 g of dry Na2CO3 having a D90 > 45 m, a D90 < 250 m and a D99.5 < 710 m ; and 0.1800 g of dry, very finely ground K2CO3 (D9o < 45 m) was added via a powder dispenser to the reaction mixture over 30 minutes. At the end of the addition, the reaction mixture was heated to 320<0>C at lC/minute. After 50 minutes at 320<0>C, 6.8203 g of 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (containing 2,4'-difluorobenzophenone and 4-monofluorobenzophenone in a cumulated amount of at most 1250 ppm) were added to the reaction mixture while keeping a nitrogen purge on the reactor. After 5 minutes, 0.4420 g of lithium chloride were added to the reaction mixture. 10 minutes later, another 2.2734 g of 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (containing 2,4'-difluorobenzophenone and 4-monofluorobenzophenone in a cumulated amount of at most 1250 ppm) were added to the reactor and the reaction mixture was kept at temperature for 15 minutes. The reactor content was then poured from the reactor into a SS pan and cooled. The solid was broken up and ground in an attrition mill through a 2 mm screen. Diphenyl sulfone and salts were extracted from the mixture with acetone and water at pH between 1 and 12. The last wash water had a pH between 6 and 7. The powder was then removed from the reactor and dried at 120<0>C under vacuum for 12 hours yielding 67-70 g of a white powder. Examples 1 through 5 describe the use of high purity DPS in the preparation of high quality PEEK.     Examples 6 through 11 are comparative examples showing the adverse effect of : High sodium and chlorine contents (6 and 7)     High iron content (7)     High residual acidity (8)     High monomethyldiphenylsulfone (9)     High monochlorodiphenylsulfone and chlorine contents (10) High water content (11).     Example 12 - recovery of diphenyl sulfone by distillation in glassware and its use in PEEK reaction     A mixture containing 81.1 wt. % acetone, 12.2 wt. % diphenyl sulfone water, 6.1 wt. % water, 0.51 wt. % 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (monomer), 650 ppm NaCl and 60 ppm KCl, was produced by extracting 1300 g of reaction mixture from example 1 with 514O g of acetone containing 7 wt. % water. The extract also contains an undetermined amount of p-hydroquinone salt, oligo(aryl ether ketone)s, etc.     In a 10 1 glass 4-neck round-bottom flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer (made of glass), a thermocouple in glass thermowell, a nitrogen inlet tube, an insulated Vigreux column with a collection flask, was introduced 4.9 kg of the above-described solution. Under atmospheric pressure, acetone was collected between 55 and 63C (liquid temperature). Then pressure was increased to 2.7 bar with nitrogen and the temperature increased to 130<0>C. Water was collected overhead. The pressure was then decreased to 76 Torr and the still temperature was increased to 250-255<0>C. A mixture of     4,4'-difluorobenzophenone and diphenyl sulfone was collected overhead. The pressure was further reduced to 52 Torr and, at the same temperature, the remaining diphenyl sulfone was collected overhead. The final mixture of diphenyl sulfone and 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (0.57 wt. %) was recovered with a 85 % yield (251 g isolated). The analysis results of the diphenyl sulfone thus obtained can be found in entry 12 in Table 1.     The recovered solvent (DPS) was used to prepare PEEK as follows : In a 500 ml 4-neck reaction flask fitted with a stirrer, a N2 inlet tube, a Claisen adapter with a thermocouple plunging in the reaction medium, and a Dean-Stark trap with a condenser and a dry ice trap were introduced 128.55 g of recovered diphenyl sulfone of quality defined hereafter in table 1, 28.5983 g of p-hydroquinone (p-hydroquinone can typically contain up to 0.6 % water - the weight here is the weight of p-hydroquinone on a dry basis, i.e. after correction for the moisture content) and 56.5009 g of 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (containing 2,4'-difluorobenzophenone and 4-monofluorobenzophenone in a cumulated amount of at most 1250 ppm). The flask content was evacuated under vacuum and then filled with high purity nitrogen (containing less than 10 ppm O2). The operation was repeated twice. The reaction mixture was then placed under a constant nitrogen purge (60 ml/min). The reaction mixture was heated slowly to 150<0>C. At 150<0>C, a mixture of 28.4259 g of dry Na2CO3 having a D90 > 45 m, a D90 < 250 m and a D99.5  710 m and 0.1800 g of dry, very finely ground K2CO3 (D90 < 45 m) was added via a powder dispenser to the reaction mixture over 30 minutes. At the end of the addition, the reaction mixture was heated to 320<0>C at lC/minute. After 50 minutes at 320<0>C, 6.8203 g of 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (containing 2,4'-difluorobenzophenone and 4-monofluorobenzophenone in a cumulated amount of at most 1250 ppm) were added to the reaction mixture while keeping a nitrogen purge on the reactor. After 5 minutes, 0.4420 g of lithium chloride were added to the reaction mixture. 10 minutes later, another 2.2734 g of 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (containing 2,4'-difluorobenzophenone and     4-monofluorobenzophenone in a cumulated amount of at most 1250 ppm) were added to the reactor and the reaction mixture was kept at temperature for 15 minutes. The reactor content was then poured from the reactor into a SS pan and cooled. The solid was broken up and ground in an attrition mill through a 2 mm screen. Diphenyl sulfone and salts were extracted from the mixture with acetone and water at pH between 1 and 12. The last wash water had a pH between 6 and 7. The powder was then removed from the reactor and dried at 120<0>C under vacuum for 12 hours yielding 66.54 g of a white powder. Example 13 : recovery of diphenyl sulfone by precipitation with a non solvent     The same extract as used in example 12 was used : mixture containing 81.1 wt. % acetone, 12.2 wt. % diphenyl sulfone, 6.1 wt. % water, 0.51 wt. % 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone, 650 ppm NaCl and 60 ppm KCl.     In a 5000 ml 2-neck-round-bottom flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, were introduced 2000 g of deionized water. Under vigorous mechanical agitation, 1000 g of the above-mentioned extract were added to the flask. The slurry was kept under agitation at room temperature for 15 minutes. The solid was then isolated by filtration on a Buchner funnel. The concentration of diphenyl sulfone in the liquid was 0.13 wt. %. The solid was reintroduced on the flask and 2000 g deionized were added. The slurry was agitated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The solid was then isolated by filtration on a Buchner funnel. The wet cake (159.8 g) was dried under vacuum (100 Torr) at 60<0>C overnight. The analysis of recovered diphenyl sulfone (114.5 g, 91 % yield) is found in entry 13 of the Table 1.     The DPS thus obtained was used in a polymerization reaction similar to example 11, except that the amounts of recovered diphenyl sulfone used was 131.77 g and the amount of virgin 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone used was 53.2805 g. Results can be found in entry 13, table 1. Example 14 : recovery of diphenyl sulfone by precipitation with a non solvent, then evaporation of a fraction of the low boiling solvent A mixture containing 81.1 wt. % acetone, 12.2 wt. % diphenyl sulfone,     6.1 wt. % water, 0.51 wt. % 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone, 650 ppmNaCl and 60 ppm KCl was obtained by extraction of a typical polymerization mixture.     In a 5000 ml 2-neck-round-bottom flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, were introduced 2000 g of deionized water. Under vigorous mechanical agitation, 2000 g of the above-mentioned extract were added to the flask. A solid precipitate was formed immediately. The reaction flask was then fitted with a distillation overhead and the slurry was heated up to 56-63<0>C under agitation. When 923 g acetone had been collected overhead, the setup was switched to total reflux conditions and the slurry was cooled down to room temperature (23C). The solid was then isolated by filtration on a Buchner funnel. The concentration of diphenyl sulfone in the liquid was 0.10 wt. %. The solid was reintroduced on the flask and 4000 g deionized were added. The slurry was agitated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The solid was then isolated by filtration on a Buchner funnel. The wet cake (325.4 g) was dried under vacuum (100 Torr) at 70<0>C overnight. The analysis of recovered diphenyl sulfone (228.5 g, 90 % yield) is found in entry 14 of Table 1.     The DPS thus obtained was used in a polymerization reaction similar to example 11, except that the amounts of recovered diphenyl sulfone used was 131.91 g and the amount of virgin 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone used was 53.1445 g. Results can be found in entry 14, tablel. Example 15 : recovery of diphenyl sulfone by crystallization     Reaction mixture (1300 g) from example 1 was extracted with xylene (2600 g) at reflux temperature. The extract was then concentrated by evaporation of xylene at atmospheric pressure to generate a typical extract as follows. Only the identified compounds are detailed. As for the other examples, some other compounds like oligo(aryl ether ketone)s were also present.     In a 1000 ml 2 neck-round-bottom flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer, 800 g of refluxing mixture containing 58.3 wt. % p-xylene, 40.0 wt. % diphenyl sulfone and 1.7 wt. % 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (monomer) were cooled down at 5C/min to 10<0>C under agitation. The solid formed upon cooling (solid started to appear at 80<0>C) was isolated by filtration on Buchner. The wet cake (352 g) containing diphenyl sulfone, 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone and xylene (10 wt. %), was reintroduced in the flask with 1056 g of deionized water. A Dean-Stark trap was fitted on top of the round-bottom flask, in replacement of the reflux condenser. The slurry was heated to 92C under agitation, and xylene was removed from the slurry as an azeotrope with water. When no more xylene was removed from the refluxing slurry, the mixture was cooled to down temperature and the solid isolated on Buchner funnel. After drying under vacuum (100 Torr)/60C, 309 g diphenyl sulfone containing 2.72 wt. % 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone was isolated. The analysis of recovered diphenyl sulfone is found in entry 15 of the Table 1.     At 10<0>C, the yield of diphenyl sulfone can be maximized (solubility of diphenyl sulfone in p-xylene at 10<0>C is 0.1 wt. %). In case more impurities need to be removed from the diphenyl sulfone, a higher crystallization temperature can be used : at 23C, the solubility of diphenyl sulfone in p-xylene is 1.38 wt. %.     The DPS thus obtained was used in a polymerization reaction similar to example 11, except that the amounts of recovered diphenyl sulfone used was 131.39 g and the amount of virgin 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone used was 53.6598 g. Results can be found in entry 15, table 1.     Examples 16 to 19 : use of diphenyl sulfone containing diphenyl sulfide     A sample of diphenyl sulfone used in example 5 was spiked with diphenyl sulfide (commercial, 98 %, Sigma- Aldrich) in different amounts (0.3 to 0.8 wt. %). Using this diphenyl sulfone, the polymerization reaction was done under the same conditions as example 5. Results are in entries 16 to 19 in Table 1. Comparative example 20 : recovery by distillation in the presence of 316 stainless steel     The same procedure as for example 11 was followed but in an 316 Stainless Steel autoclave fitted with a packed column (non structured 316 Stainless Steel packing). The final mixture of diphenyl sulfone and     4,4'-difluorobenzophenone ( 0.51 wt. %) was recovered with a 79 % yield (229 g isolated).

The government has certain rights in this invention.      Reference to a Sequence Listing      This application contains a Sequence Listing in computer readable form.

Background of the Invention      Field of the Invention      The present invention relates to enzyme compositions for high temperature saccharification of cellulosic material and to uses thereof.      Description of the Related Art      Cellulose is a polymer of the simple sugar glucose linked by beta-1 ,4 bonds. Many microorganisms produce enzymes that hydrolyze beta-linked glucans. These enzymes include endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and beta-glucosidases. Endoglucanases digest the cellulose polymer at random locations, opening it to attack by cellobiohydrolases. Cellobiohydrolases sequentially release molecules of cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water-soluble beta-1 ,4-linked dimer of glucose. Beta- glucosidases hydrolyze cellobiose to glucose.      The conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks into ethanol has the advantages of the ready availability of large amounts of feedstock, the desirability of avoiding burning or land filling the materials, and the cleanliness of the ethanol fuel. Wood, agricultural residues, herbaceous crops, and municipal solid wastes have been considered as feedstocks for ethanol production. These materials primarily consist of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Once the cellulose is converted to glucose, the glucose is easily fermented by yeast into ethanol.      There is a need in the art for new enzyme compositions to increase efficiency and to provide cost-effective enzyme solutions for high temperature saccharification of cellulosic material.      The present invention provides compositions for high temperature saccharification of cellulosic material and to uses thereof Summary of the Invention      The present invention relates to enzyme compositions, comprising two or more (several) components selected from the group consisting of:      (I) a polypeptide having cellobiohydrolase I activity selected from the group consisting of:      (A) (a) a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence having preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95% identity, and most preferably at least 97% identity to the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2;

Definitions      Cellulolytic enzyme or cellulase: The term ""cellulolytic enzyme"" or ""cellulase"" means one or more (several) enzymes that hydrolyze a cellulosic material. Such enzymes include endoglucanase(s), cellobiohydrolase(s), beta-glucosidase(s), or combinations thereof. The two basic approaches for measuring cellulolytic activity include: (1 ) measuring the total cellulolytic activity, and (2) measuring the individual cellulolytic activities (endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and beta-glucosidases) as reviewed in Zhang et al., Outlook for cellulase improvement: Screening and selection strategies, 2006, Biotechnology Advances 24: 452-481. Total cellulolytic activity is usually measured using insoluble substrates, including Whatman N1 filter paper, microcrystalline cellulose, bacterial cellulose, algal cellulose, cotton, pretreated lignocellulose, etc. The most common total cellulolytic activity assay is the filter paper assay using Whatman N1 filter paper as the substrate. The assay was established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (lUPAC) (Ghose, 1987, Measurement of cellulase activities, Pure Appl. Chem. 59: 257-68).      For purposes of the present invention, cellulolytic enzyme activity is determined by measuring the increase in hydrolysis of a cellulosic material by cellulolytic enzyme(s) under the following conditions: 1-20 mg of cellulolytic enzyme protein/g of cellulose in PCS for 3-7 days at 50C compared to a control hydrolysis without addition of cellulolytic enzyme protein. Typical conditions are 1 ml reactions, washed or unwashed PCS, 5% insoluble solids, 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5, 1 mM MnS04, 50C, 72 hours, sugar analysis by AMINEX HPX- 87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).      Endoglucanase: The term ""endoglucanase"" means an endo-1 ,4-(1 ,3;1 ,4)-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1 .4), which catalyses endohydrolysis of 1 ,4-beta-D- glycosidic linkages in cellulose, cellulose derivatives (such as carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose), lichenin, beta-1 ,4 bonds in mixed beta-1 ,3 glucans such as cereal beta-D-glucans or xyloglucans, and other plant material containing cellulosic components. Endoglucanase activity can be determined by measuring reduction in substrate viscosity or increase in reducing ends determined by a reducing sugar assay (Zhang et al., 2006, Biotechnology Advances 24: 452-481 ). For purposes of the present invention, endoglucanase activity is determined using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as substrate according to the procedure of Ghose, 1987, Pure and Appl. Chem. 59: 257-268, at pH 5, 40C.      Cellobiohydrolase: The term ""cellobiohydrolase"" means a 1 ,4-beta-D-glucan cellobiohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.91 ), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 ,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose, cellooligosaccharides, or any beta-1 ,4-linked glucose containing polymer, releasing cellobiose from the reducing or non-reducing ends of the chain (Teeri, 1997, Crystalline cellulose degradation: New insight into the function of cellobiohydrolases, Trends in Biotechnology 15: 160-167; Teeri et al., 1998, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolases: why so efficient on crystalline cellulose?, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 26: 173- 178). For purposes of the present invention, cellobiohydrolase activity is determined according to the procedures described by Lever et al., 1972, Anal. Biochem. 47: 273-279; van Tilbeurgh et al., 1982, FEBS Letters, 149: 152-156; van Tilbeurgh and Claeyssens, 1985, FEBS Letters, 187: 283-288; and Tomme et al., 1988, Eur. J. Biochem. 170: 575-581. In the present invention, the Lever et al. method can be employed to assess hydrolysis of cellulose in corn stover, while the methods of van Tilbeurgh et al. and Tomme et al. can be used to determine the cellobiohydrolase activity on a fluorescent disaccharide derivative, 4- methylumbelliferyl-3-D-lactoside.      Beta-glucosidase: The term ""beta-glucosidase"" means a beta-D-glucoside glucohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.21 ), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal non-reducing beta-D-glucose residues with the release of beta-D-glucose. For purposes of the present invention, beta-glucosidase activity is determined according to the basic procedure described by Venturi et al., 2002, Extracellular beta-D-glucosidase from Chaetomium thermophilum var. coprophilum: production, purification and some biochemical properties, J. Basic Microbiol. 42: 55-66. One unit of beta-glucosidase is defined as 1.0  of p- nitrophenolate anion produced per minute at 25C, pH 4.8 from 1 mM p-nitrophenyl-beta-D- glucopyranoside as substrate in 50 mM sodium citrate containing 0.01 % TWEEN 20.      Polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity: The term ""polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity"" means a GH61 polypeptide that catalyzes the enhancement of the hydrolysis of a cellulosic material by enzyme having cellulolytic activity. For purposes of the present invention, cellulolytic enhancing activity is determined by measuring the increase in reducing sugars or the increase of the total of cellobiose and glucose from the hydrolysis of a cellulosic material by cellulolytic enzyme under the following conditions: 1 -50 mg of total protein/g of cellulose in PCS, wherein total protein is comprised of 50-99.5% w/w cellulolytic enzyme protein and 0.5-50% w/w protein of a GH61 polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity for 1 -7 days at 50C compared to a control hydrolysis with equal total protein loading without cellulolytic enhancing activity (1-50 mg of cellulolytic protein/g of cellulose in PCS). In a preferred aspect, a mixture of CELLUCLAST 1.5L (Novozymes A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) in the presence of 2-3% of total protein weight Aspergillus oryzae beta-glucosidase (recombinantly produced in Aspergillus oryzae according to WO 02/095014) or 2-3% of total protein weight Aspergillus fumigatus beta-glucosidase (recombinantly produced in Aspergillus oryzae as described in WO 2002/095014) of cellulase protein loading is used as the source of the cellulolytic activity.      The GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity enhance the hydrolysis of a cellulosic material catalyzed by enzyme having cellulolytic activity by reducing the amount of cellulolytic enzyme required to reach the same degree of hydrolysis preferably at least 1.01 -fold, more preferably at least 1 .05-fold, more preferably at least 1.10-fold, more preferably at least 1 .25-fold, more preferably at least 1 .5-fold, more preferably at least 2-fold, more preferably at least 3-fold, more preferably at least 4-fold, more preferably at least 5- fold, even more preferably at least 10-fold, and most preferably at least 20-fold.      Hemicellulolytic enzyme or hemicellulase: The term ""hemicellulolytic enzyme"" or ""hemicellulase"" means one or more (several) enzymes that hydrolyze a hemicellulosic material. See, for example, Shallom, D. and Shoham, Y. Microbial hemicellulases. Current Opinion In Microbiology, 2003, 6(3): 219-228). Hemicellulases are key components in the degradation of plant biomass. Examples of hemicellulases include, but are not limited to, an acetylmannan esterase, an acetyxylan esterase, an arabinanase, an arabinofuranosidase, a coumaric acid esterase, a feruloyl esterase, a galactosidase, a glucuronidase, a glucuronoyl esterase, a mannanase, a mannosidase, a xylanase, and a xylosidase. The substrates of these enzymes, the hemicelluloses, are a heterogeneous group of branched and linear polysaccharides that are bound via hydrogen bonds to the cellulose microfibrils in the plant cell wall, crosslinking them into a robust network. Hemicelluloses are also covalently attached to lignin, forming together with cellulose a highly complex structure. The variable structure and organization of hemicelluloses require the concerted action of many enzymes for its complete degradation. The catalytic modules of hemicellulases are either glycoside hydrolases (GHs) that hydrolyze glycosidic bonds, or carbohydrate esterases (CEs), which hydrolyze ester linkages of acetate or ferulic acid side groups. These catalytic modules, based on homology of their primary sequence, can be assigned into GH and CE families marked by numbers. Some families, with overall similar fold, can be further grouped into clans, marked alphabetically (e.g., GH-A). A most informative and updated classification of these and other carbohydrate active enzymes is available on the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database. Hemicellulolytic enzyme activities can be measured according to Ghose and Bisaria, 1987, Pure & Appl. Chem. 59: 1739-1752.      Xylan degrading activity or xylanolytic activity: The term ""xylan degrading activity"" or ""xylanolytic activity"" means a biological activity that hydrolyzes xylan-containing material. The two basic approaches for measuring xylanolytic activity include: (1 ) measuring the total xylanolytic activity, and (2) measuring the individual xylanolytic activities (e.g., endoxylanases, beta-xylosidases, arabinofuranosidases, alpha-glucuronidases, acetylxylan esterases, feruloyi esterases, and alpha-glucuronyl esterases). Recent progress in assays of xylanolytic enzymes was summarized in several publications including Biely and Puchard, Recent progress in the assays of xylanolytic enzymes, 2006, Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture 86(1 1 ): 1636-1647; Spanikova and Biely, 2006, Glucuronoyl esterase - Novel carbohydrate esterase produced by Schizophyllum commune, FEBS Letters 580(19): 4597-4601 ; Herrmann, Vrsanska, Jurickova, Hirsch, Biely, and Kubicek, 1997, The beta-D- xylosidase of Trichoderma reesei is a multifunctional beta-D-xylan xylohydrolase, Biochemical Journal 321 : 375-381 .      Total xylan degrading activity can be measured by determining the reducing sugars formed from various types of xylan, including, for example, oat spelt, beechwood, and larchwood xylans, or by photometric determination of dyed xylan fragments released from various covalently dyed xylans. The most common total xylanolytic activity assay is based on production of reducing sugars from polymeric 4-O-methyl glucuronoxylan as described in Bailey, Biely, Poutanen, 1992, Interlaboratory testing of methods for assay of xylanase activity, Journal of Biotechnology 23(3): 257-270. Xylanase activity can also be determined with 0.2% AZCL-arabinoxylan as substrate in 0.01 % Triton X-100 and 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6 at 37C. One unit of xylanase activity is defined as 1 .0  of azurine produced per minute at 37C, pH 6 from 0.2% AZCL-arabinoxylan as substrate in 200 mM sodium phosphate pH 6 buffer.      For purposes of the present invention, xylan degrading activity is determined by measuring the increase in hydrolysis of birchwood xylan (Sigma Chemical Co., Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) by xylan-degrading enzyme(s) under the following typical conditions: 1 ml reactions, 5 mg/ml substrate (total solids), 5 mg of xylanolytic protein/g of substrate, 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5, 50C, 24 hours, sugar analysis using p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide (PHBAH) assay as described by Lever, 1972, A new reaction for colorimetric determination of carbohydrates, Anal.

For purposes of the present invention, acetylxylan esterase activity is determined using 0.5 mM p- nitrophenylacetate as substrate in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 containing 0.01 % TWEEN 20. One unit of acetylxylan esterase is defined as the amount of enzyme capable of releasing 1  of p-nitrophenolate anion per minute at pH 5, 25C.      Feruloyl esterase: The term ""feruloyl esterase"" means a 4-hydroxy-3- methoxycinnamoyl-sugar hydrolase (EC 3.1 .1.73) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 4- hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamoyl (feruloyl) group from an esterified sugar, which is usually arabinose in ""natural"" substrates, to produce ferulate (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamate). Feruloyl esterase is also known as ferulic acid esterase, hydroxycinnamoyl esterase, FAE- III, cinnamoyl ester hydrolase, FAEA, cinnAE, FAE-I, or FAE-II. For purposes of the present invention, feruloyl esterase activity is determined using 0.5 mM p-nitrophenylferulate as substrate in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0.

J. 280: 309- 316, and Henrissat and Bairoch, 1996, Updating the sequence-based classification of glycosyl hydrolases, Biochem. J. 316: 695-696.      Cellulosic material: The cellulosic material can be any material containing cellulose. The predominant polysaccharide in the primary cell wall of biomass is cellulose, the second most abundant is hemicellulose, and the third is pectin. The secondary cell wall, produced after the cell has stopped growing, also contains polysaccharides and is strengthened by polymeric lignin covalently cross-linked to hemicellulose. Cellulose is a homopolymer of anhydrocellobiose and thus a linear beta-(1-4)-D-glucan, while hemicelluloses include a variety of compounds, such as xylans, xyloglucans, arabinoxylans, and mannans in complex branched structures with a spectrum of substituents. Although generally polymorphous, cellulose is found in plant tissue primarily as an insoluble crystalline matrix of parallel glucan chains. Hemicelluloses usually hydrogen bond to cellulose, as well as to other hemicelluloses, which help stabilize the cell wall matrix.      Cellulose is generally found, for example, in the stems, leaves, hulls, husks, and cobs of plants or leaves, branches, and wood of trees. The cellulosic material can be, but is not limited to, herbaceous material, agricultural residue, forestry residue, municipal solid waste, waste paper, and pulp and paper mill residue (see, for example, Wiselogel et al., 1995, in Handbook on Bioethanol (Charles E. Wyman, editor), pp.105-1 18, Taylor & Francis, Washington D.C.; Wyman, 1994, Bioresource Technology 50: 3-16; Lynd, 1990, Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology 24/25: 695-719; Mosier et al, 1999, Recent Progress in Bioconversion of Lignocellulosics, in Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology, T. Scheper, managing editor, Volume 65, pp.23-40, Springer-Verlag, New York). It is understood herein that the cellulose may be in the form of lignocellulose, a plant cell wall material containing lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose in a mixed matrix.

The cellulosic material may be used as is or may be subjected to pretreatment, using conventional methods known in the art, as described herein. In a preferred aspect, the cellulosic material is pretreated.      Pretreated corn stover: The term ""PCS"" or ""Pretreated Corn Stover"" means a cellulosic material derived from corn stover by treatment with heat and dilute sulfuric acid.      Isolated or purified: The term ""isolated"" or ""purified"" means a polypeptide or polynucleotide that is removed from at least one component with which it is naturally associated. For example, a polypeptide may be at least 1 % pure, e.g., at least 5% pure, at least 10% pure, at least 20% pure, at least 40% pure, at least 60% pure, at least 80% pure, at least 90% pure, or at least 95% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE, and a polynucleotide may be at least 1 % pure, e.g., at least 5% pure, at least 10% pure, at least 20% pure, at least 40% pure, at least 60% pure, at least 80% pure, at least 90% pure, or at least 95% pure, as determined by agarose electrophoresis.      Mature polypeptide: The term ""mature polypeptide"" means a polypeptide in its final form following translation and any post-translational modifications, such as N-terminal processing, C-terminal truncation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, etc. It is known in the art that a host cell may produce a mixture of two of more different mature polypeptides (i.e., with a different C-terminal and/or N-terminal amino acid) expressed by the same polynucleotide. The mature polypeptide can be predicted using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1 -6).      Mature polypeptide coding sequence: The term ""mature polypeptide coding sequence"" is defined herein as a nucleotide sequence that encodes a mature polypeptide having biological activity. The mature polypeptide coding sequence can be predicted using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, supra).      Sequence Identity: The relatedness between two amino acid sequences or between two nucleotide sequences is described by the parameter ""sequence identity"".      For purposes of the present invention, the degree of sequence identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, Trends Genet. 16: 276-277), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of BLOSUM62) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled ""longest identity"" (obtained using the -nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows:      (Identical Residues x 100)/(Length of Alignment - Total Number of Gaps in Alignment) For purposes of the present invention, the degree of sequence identity between two deoxyribonucleotide sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, supra) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, supra), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EDNAFULL (EMBOSS version of NCBI NUC4.4) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled ""longest identity"" (obtained using the -nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows:      (Identical Deoxyribonucleotides x 100)/(Length of Alignment - Total Number of Gaps in Alignment)      Polypeptide fragment: The term ""fragment"" means a polypeptide having one or more (several) amino acids deleted from the amino and/or carboxyl terminus of a mature polypeptide; wherein the fragment has biological activity.      Subsequence: The term ""subsequence"" means a polynucleotide having one or more (several) nucleotides deleted from the 5' and/or 3' end of a mature polypeptide coding sequence; wherein the subsequence encodes a fragment having biological activity.      Allelic variant: The term ""allelic variant"" means any of two or more alternative forms of a gene occupying the same chromosomal locus. Allelic variation arises naturally through mutation, and may result in polymorphism within populations. Gene mutations can be silent (no change in the encoded polypeptide) or may encode polypeptides having altered amino acid sequences. An allelic variant of a polypeptide is a polypeptide encoded by an allelic variant of a gene.      Coding sequence: The term ""coding sequence"" means a polynucleotide, which directly specifies the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. The boundaries of the coding sequence are generally determined by an open reading frame, which usually begins with the ATG start codon or alternative start codons such as GTG and TTG and ends with a stop codon such as TAA, TAG, and TGA. The coding sequence may be a DNA, cDNA, synthetic, or recombinant polynucleotide.      cDNA: The term ""cDNA"" means a DNA molecule that can be prepared by reverse transcription from a mature, spliced, mRNA molecule obtained from a eukaryotic cell. cDNA lacks intron sequences that may be present in the corresponding genomic DNA. The initial, primary RNA transcript is a precursor to mRNA that is processed through a series of steps, including splicing, before appearing as mature spliced mRNA.      Nucleic acid construct: The term ""nucleic acid construct"" means a nucleic acid molecule, either single- or double-stranded, which is isolated from a naturally occurring gene or is modified to contain segments of nucleic acids in a manner that would not otherwise exist in nature or which is synthetic. The term nucleic acid construct is synonymous with the term ""expression cassette"" when the nucleic acid construct contains the control sequences required for expression of a coding sequence of the present invention.      Control sequences: The term ""control sequences"" means all components necessary for the expression of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide or native or foreign to each other. Such control sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenylation sequence, propeptide sequence, promoter, signal peptide sequence, and transcription terminator. At a minimum, the control sequences include a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences with the coding region of the polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide.      Operably linked: The term ""operably linked"" means a configuration in which a control sequence is placed at an appropriate position relative to the coding sequence of a polynucleotide such that the control sequence directs the expression of the coding sequence. Expression: The term ""expression"" includes any step involved in the production of the polypeptide including, but not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification, translation, post-translational modification, and secretion.      Expression vector: The term ""expression vector"" means a linear or circular DNA molecule that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide and is operably linked to additional nucleotides that provide for its expression.      Host cell: The term ""host cell"" means any cell type that is susceptible to transformation, transfection, transduction, and the like with a nucleic acid construct or expression vector comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention. The term ""host cell"" encompasses any progeny of a parent cell that is not identical to the parent cell due to mutations that occur during replication.

It will be understood that for the aforementioned species the invention encompasses both the perfect and imperfect states, and other taxonomic equivalents, e.g., anamorphs, regardless of the species name by which they are known. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize the identity of appropriate equivalents.      Strains of these species are readily accessible to the public in a number of culture collections, such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM), Centraalbureau Voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), and Agricultural Research Service Patent Culture Collection, Northern Regional Research Center (NRRL).      Furthermore, such polypeptides may be identified and obtained from other sources including microorganisms isolated from nature (e.g., soil, composts, water, etc.) using the above-mentioned probes. Techniques for isolating microorganisms from natural habitats are well known in the art. The polynucleotide may then be obtained by similarly screening a genomic or cDNA library of such a microorganism. Once a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide has been detected with the probe(s), the polynucleotide can be isolated or cloned by utilizing techniques that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra).      Such polypeptides also include fused polypeptides or cleavable fusion polypeptides in which another polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the polypeptide or fragment thereof. A fused polypeptide is produced by fusing a nucleotide sequence (or a portion thereof) encoding another polypeptide to a nucleotide sequence (or a portion thereof) of the present invention. Techniques for producing fusion polypeptides are known in the art, and include ligating the coding sequences encoding the polypeptides so that they are in frame and that expression of the fused polypeptide is under control of the same promoter(s) and terminator.      A fusion polypeptide can further comprise a cleavage site between the two polypeptides. Upon secretion of the fusion protein, the site is cleaved releasing the two polypeptides. Examples of cleavage sites include, but are not limited to, the sites disclosed in Martin et al., 2003, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 3: 568-576; Svetina et al., 2000, J. Biotechnol. 76: 245-251 ; Rasmussen-Wilson et al., 1997, Appl. Environ.

Nucleic Acid Constructs      A nucleic acid construct comprising an isolated polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide component of an enzyme composition of the present invention may be constructed by operably linking the polynucleotide to one or more (several) control sequences that direct the expression of the coding sequence in a suitable host cell under conditions compatible with the control sequences. Manipulation of the polynucleotide's sequence prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying polynucleotide sequences utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art.      The control sequence may be an appropriate promoter sequence, a nucleotide sequence that is recognized by a host cell for expression of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. The promoter sequence contains transcriptional control sequences that mediate the expression of the polypeptide. The promoter may be any nucleotide sequence that shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice including mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters, and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.      Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention, especially in a bacterial host cell, are the promoters obtained from the E. coli lac operon, Streptomyces coelicolor agarase gene (dagA), Bacillus subtilis levansucrase gene (sacB), Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene (amyL), Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene (amyM), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene (amyQ), Bacillus licheniformis penicillinase gene (penP), Bacillus subtilis xylA and xylB genes, and prokaryotic beta-lactamase gene (Villa-Kamaroff et al., 1978, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 75: 3727-3731 ), as well as the tac promoter (DeBoer et al., 1983, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 80: 21 -25). Further promoters are described in ""Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria"" in Scientific American, 1980, 242: 74-94; and in Sambrook et al., 1989, supra.

In a yeast host, useful promoters are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1 ), Saccharomyces cerevisiae galactokinase (GAL1 ), Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH1 , ADH2/GAP), Saccharomyces cerevisiae triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), Saccharomyces cerevisiae metallothionein (CUP1 ), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, Yeast 8: 423-488.      The control sequence may also be a suitable transcription terminator sequence, a sequence recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator sequence is operably linked to the 3' terminus of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any terminator that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention.      Preferred terminators for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase, Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, and Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease.      Preferred terminators for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome C (CYC1 ), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Other useful terminators for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra.      The control sequence may also be a suitable leader sequence, a nontranslated region of an mRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader sequence is operably linked to the 5' terminus of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. Any leader sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention.      Preferred leaders for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for     Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase and Aspergillus nidulans triose phosphate isomerase.      Suitable leaders for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1 ), Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2/GAP).      The control sequence may also be a polyadenylation sequence, a sequence operably linked to the 3' terminus of the nucleotide sequence and, when transcribed, is recognized by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation sequence that is functional in the host cell of choice may be used in the present invention.      Preferred polyadenylation sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease, and Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase.      Useful polyadenylation sequences for yeast host cells are described by Guo and     Sherman, 1995, Molecular Cellular Biology 15: 5983-5990. The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that encodes a signal peptide linked to the N-terminus of a polypeptide and directs the polypeptide into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5'-end of the coding sequence of the polynucleotide may inherently contain a signal peptide coding sequence naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding sequence that encodes the polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5'-end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding sequence that is foreign to the coding sequence. The foreign signal peptide coding sequence may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding sequence. Alternatively, the foreign signal peptide coding sequence may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding sequence in order to enhance secretion of the polypeptide. However, any signal peptide coding sequence that directs the expressed polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell of choice may be used.      Effective signal peptide coding sequences for bacterial host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for Bacillus NCIB 1 1837 maltogenic amylase, Bacillus licheniformis subtilisin, Bacillus licheniformis beta-lactamase, Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase, Bacillus stearothermophilus neutral proteases {nprT, nprS, nprM), and Bacillus subtilis prsA. Further signal peptides are described by Simonen and Palva, 1993, Microbiological Reviews 57: 109-137.      Effective signal peptide coding sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for Aspergillus niger neutral amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Humicola insolens cellulase, Humicola insolens endoglucanase V, Humicola lanuginosa lipase, and Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase.      Useful signal peptides for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor and Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase. Other useful signal peptide coding sequences are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra.      The control sequence may also be a propeptide coding sequence that encodes a propeptide positioned at the N-terminus of a polypeptide. The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide (or a zymogen in some cases). A propolypeptide is generally inactive and can be converted to an active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding sequence may be obtained from the genes for Bacillus subtilis alkaline protease {aprE), Bacillus subtilis neutral protease {nprT), Myceliophthora thermophila laccase (WO 95/33836), Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor.      Where both signal peptide and propeptide sequences are present at the N-terminus of a polypeptide, the propeptide sequence is positioned next to the N-terminus of a polypeptide and the signal peptide sequence is positioned next to the N-terminus of the propeptide sequence.      It may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences that allow the regulation of the expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory systems are those that cause the expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory systems in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the Aspergillus niger glucoamylase promoter, Aspergillus oryzae TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, and Aspergillus oryzae glucoamylase promoter may be used. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those that allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems, these regulatory sequences include the dihydrofolate reductase gene that is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes that are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide would be operably linked with the regulatory sequence.      Expression Vectors      The various nucleic acids and control sequences described herein may be joined together to construct a recombinant expression vector that may include one or more (several) convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of an isolated polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide component of the enzyme composition at such sites. Alternatively, a polynucleotide sequence may be expressed by inserting the nucleotide sequence or a nucleic acid construct comprising the sequence into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.      The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) that can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about expression of the nucleotide sequence. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vectors may be linear or closed circular plasmids.      The vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one that, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids that together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon, may be used.      The vectors preferably contain one or more (several) selectable markers that permit easy selection of transformed, transfected, transduced, or the like cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like.      Examples of bacterial selectable markers are the dal genes from Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus licheniformis, or markers that confer antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, or tetracycline resistance. Suitable markers for yeast host cells are ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1 , and URA3. Selectable markers for use in a filamentous fungal host cell include, but are not limited to, amdS (acetamidase), argB (ornithine carbamoyltransferase), bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase), hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase), niaD (nitrate reductase), pyrG (orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase), sC (sulfate adenyltransferase), and trpC (anthranilate synthase), as well as equivalents thereof. Preferred for use in an Aspergillus cell are the amdS and pyrG genes of Aspergillus nidulans or Aspergillus oryzae and the bar gene of Streptomyces hygroscopicus.      The vectors preferably contain an element(s) that permits integration of the vector into the host cell's genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome.      For integration into the host cell genome, the vector may rely on the polynucleotide's sequence encoding the polypeptide or any other element of the vector for integration into the genome by homologous or nonhomologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector may contain additional nucleotide sequences for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should preferably contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids, such as 100 to 10,000 base pairs, preferably 400 to 10,000 base pairs, and most preferably 800 to 10,000 base pairs, which have a high degree of identity to the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding nucleotide sequences. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by nonhomologous recombination.      For autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question. The origin of replication may be any plasmid replicator mediating autonomous replication that functions in a cell. The term ""origin of replication"" or ""plasmid replicator"" is defined herein as a nucleotide sequence that enables a plasmid or vector to replicate in vivo.      Examples of bacterial origins of replication are the origins of replication of plasmids pBR322, pUC19, pACYC177, and pACYC184 permitting replication in E. coli, and pUB1 10, pE194, pTA1060, and  permitting replication in Bacillus.      Examples of origins of replication for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication, ARS1 , ARS4, the combination of ARS1 and CEN3, and the combination of ARS4 and CEN6.      Examples of origins of replication useful in a filamentous fungal cell are AMA1 and ANSI (Gems et al., 1991 , Gene 98: 61 -67; Cullen et ai, 1987, Nucleic Acids Research 15: 9163-9175; WO 00/24883). Isolation of the AMA1 gene and construction of plasmids or vectors comprising the gene can be accomplished according to the methods disclosed in WO 00/24883.      More than one copy of a polynucleotide may be inserted into a host cell to increase production of the gene product. An increase in the copy number of the polynucleotide can be obtained by integrating at least one additional copy of the sequence into the host cell genome or by including an amplifiable selectable marker gene with the polynucleotide where cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene, and thereby additional copies of the polynucleotide, can be selected for by cultivating the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent.      The procedures used to ligate the elements described above to construct the recombinant expression vectors are well known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra).      Host Cells      The present invention also relates to recombinant host cells, comprising one or more isolated polynucleotides encoding polypeptide components of the enzyme composition, which are advantageously used in the recombinant production of the polypeptides. A vector is introduced into a host cell so that the vector is maintained as a chromosomal integrant or as a self-replicating extra-chromosomal vector as described earlier. The term ""host cell"" encompasses any progeny of a parent cell that is not identical to the parent cell due to mutations that occur during replication. The choice of a host cell will to a large extent depend upon the gene encoding the polypeptide and its source.      The host cell may be any cell useful in the recombinant production of a polypeptide of the present invention, e.g., a prokaryote or a eukaryote.      The prokaryotic host cell may be any Gram positive bacterium or a Gram negative bacterium. Gram positive bacteria include, but not limited to, Bacillus, Streptococcus, Streptomyces, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Clostridium, Geobacillus, and Oceanobacillus. Gram negative bacteria include, but not limited to, E. coli, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Helicobacter, Flavobacterium, Fusobacterium, llyobacter, Neisseria, and Ureaplasma.

Zooepidemicus cells.      In a preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptococcus equisimilis cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptococcus pyogenes cell.

Streptomyces cells useful in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, Streptomyces achromogenes, Streptomyces avermitilis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces griseus, and Streptomyces lividans cells.      In a preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptomyces achromogenes cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptomyces avermitilis cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptomyces coelicolor cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptomyces griseus cell. In another preferred aspect, the bacterial host cell is a Streptomyces lividans cell.      The introduction of DNA into a Bacillus cell may, for instance, be effected by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Chang and Cohen, 1979, Molecular General Genetics 168: 1 1 1-1 15), by using competent cells (see, e.g., Young and Spizizen, 1961 , Journal of Bacteriology 81 : 823-829, or Dubnau and Davidoff-Abelson, 1971 , Journal of Molecular Biology 56: 209-221 ), by electroporation (see, e.g., Shigekawa and Dower, 1988, Biotechniques 6: 742-751 ), or by conjugation (see, e.g., Koehler and Thorne, 1987, Journal of Bacteriology 169: 5271-5278). The introduction of DNA into an  coli cell may, for instance, be effected by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Hanahan, 1983, J. Mol. Biol. 166: 557-580) or electroporation (see, e.g., Dower et al., 1988, Nucleic Acids Res. 16: 6127- 6145). The introduction of DNA into a Streptomyces cell may, for instance, be effected by protoplast transformation and electroporation (see, e.g., Gong et al., 2004, Folia Microbiol. (Praha) 49: 399-405), by conjugation (see, e.g., Mazodier et al., 1989, J. Bacteriol. 171 : 3583-3585), or by transduction (see, e.g., Burke et al., 2001 , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98: 6289-6294). The introduction of DNA into a Pseudomonas cell may, for instance, be effected by electroporation (see, e.g., Choi et al., 2006, J. Microbiol. Methods 64: 391 -397) or by conjugation (see, e.g., Pinedo and Smets, 2005, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 71 : 51-57). The introduction of DNA into a Streptococcus cell may, for instance, be effected by natural competence (see, e.g., Perry and Kuramitsu, 1981 , Infect. Immun. 32: 1295-1297), by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Catt and Jollick, 1991 , Microbios. 68: 189-207, by electroporation (see, e.g., Buckley et al., 1999, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65: 3800-3804) or by conjugation (see, e.g., Clewell, 1981 , Microbiol. Rev. 45: 409-436). However, any method known in the art for introducing DNA into a host cell can be used.      The host cell may also be a eukaryote, such as a mammalian, insect, plant, or fungal cell.      In a preferred aspect, the host cell is a fungal cell. ""Fungi"" as used herein includes the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Zygomycota (as defined by Hawksworth et al., In, Ainsworth and Bisby's Dictionary of The Fungi, 8th edition, 1995, CAB International, University Press, Cambridge, UK) as well as the Oomycota (as cited in Hawksworth et al., 1995, supra, page 171 ) and all mitosporic fungi (Hawksworth et al., 1995, supra).      In a more preferred aspect, the fungal host cell is a yeast cell. ""Yeast"" as used herein includes ascosporogenous yeast (Endomycetales), basidiosporogenous yeast, and yeast belonging to the Fungi Imperfecti (Blastomycetes). Since the classification of yeast may change in the future, for the purposes of this invention, yeast shall be defined as described in Biology and Activities of Yeast (Skinner, F.A., Passmore, S.M., and Davenport, R.R., eds, Soc. App. Bacteriol. Symposium Series No. 9, 1980).      In an even more preferred aspect, the yeast host cell is a Candida, Hansenula, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces, or Yarrowia cell.      In a most preferred aspect, the yeast host cell is a Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces diastaticus, Saccharomyces douglasii, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Saccharomyces norbensis, or Saccharomyces oviformis cell. In another most preferred aspect, the yeast host cell is a Kluyveromyces lactis cell. In another most preferred aspect, the yeast host cell is a Yarrowia lipolytica cell.      In another more preferred aspect, the fungal host cell is a filamentous fungal cell. ""Filamentous fungi"" include all filamentous forms of the subdivision Eumycota and Oomycota (as defined by Hawksworth et al, 1995, supra). The filamentous fungi are generally characterized by a mycelial wall composed of chitin, cellulose, glucan, chitosan, mannan, and other complex polysaccharides. Vegetative growth is by hyphal elongation and carbon catabolism is obligately aerobic. In contrast, vegetative growth by yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae is by budding of a unicellular thallus and carbon catabolism may be fermentative.      In an even more preferred aspect, the filamentous fungal host cell is an Acremonium,     Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Bjerkandera, Ceriporiopsis, Chrysosporium, Coprinus, Coriolus, Cryptococcus, Filibasidium, Fusarium, Humicola, Magnaporthe, Mucor, Myceliophthora, Neocallimastix, Neurospora, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Phanerochaete, Phlebia, Piromyces, Pleurotus, Schizophyllum, Talaromyces, Thermoascus, Thielavia, Tolypocladium, Trametes, or Trichoderma cell.

Fungal cells may be transformed by a process involving protoplast formation, transformation of the protoplasts, and regeneration of the cell wall in a manner known per se. Suitable procedures for transformation of Aspergillus and Trichoderma host cells are described in EP 238 023 and Yelton et al., 1984, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 81 : 1470-1474. Suitable methods for transforming Fusarium species are described by Malardier et al., 1989, Gene 78: 147-156, and WO 96/00787. Yeast may be transformed using the procedures described by Becker and Guarente, In Abelson, J.N. and Simon, M.I., editors, Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology, Methods in Enzymology, Volume 194, pp 182-187, Academic Press, Inc., New York; Ito et al., 1983, Journal of Bacteriology 153: 163; and Hinnen et al., 1978, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 75: 1920. Methods of Production      The present invention also relates to methods of producing an enzyme composition of the present invention, comprising: (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell, as described herein, under conditions conducive for production of the enzyme composition; and (b) recovering the enzyme composition.      In the production methods of the present invention, the cells are cultivated in a nutrient medium suitable for production of the enzyme composition using methods well known in the art. For example, the cell may be cultivated by shake flask cultivation, and small-scale or large-scale fermentation (including continuous, batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations) in laboratory or industrial fermentors performed in a suitable medium and under conditions allowing the enzyme composition to be expressed and/or isolated. The cultivation takes place in a suitable nutrient medium comprising carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published compositions (e.g. , in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). If the components of the enzyme composition are secreted into the nutrient medium, the enzyme composition can be recovered directly from the medium. If the components of the enzyme composition are not secreted into the medium, the enzyme composition can be recovered from cell lysates.      The polypeptide components may be detected using methods known in the art that are specific for the polypeptides. These detection methods may include use of specific antibodies, formation of an enzyme product, or disappearance of an enzyme substrate.      The resulting enzyme composition may be recovered using methods known in the art. For example, the enzyme composition may be recovered from the nutrient medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, centrifugation, filtration, extraction, spray-drying, evaporation, or precipitation.      An enzyme composition of the present invention may be purified by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobic, chromatofocusing, and size exclusion), electrophoretic procedures (e.g., preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (e.g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), SDS-PAGE, or extraction (see, e.g., Protein Purification, J.-C. Janson and Lars Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989) to obtain substantially pure polypeptides.      Methods of Processing Cellulosic Material      The present invention also relates to methods for degrading or converting a cellulosic material, comprising: treating the cellulosic material with an enzyme composition of the present invention. In a preferred aspect, the method further comprises recovering the degraded or converted cellulosic material.      The present invention also relates to methods of producing a fermentation product, comprising: (a) saccharifying a cellulosic material with an enzyme composition of the present invention; (b) fermenting the saccharified cellulosic material with one or more fermenting microorganisms to produce the fermentation product; and (c) recovering the fermentation product from the fermentation.      The present invention also relates to methods of fermenting a cellulosic material, comprising: fermenting the cellulosic material with one or more fermenting microorganisms, wherein the cellulosic material is saccharified with an enzyme composition of the present invention. In a preferred aspect, the fermenting of the cellulosic material produces a fermentation product. In another preferred aspect, the method further comprises recovering the fermentation product from the fermentation.      The methods of the present invention can be used to saccharify a cellulosic material to fermentable sugars and convert the fermentable sugars to many useful substances, e.g., chemicals and fuels. The production of a desired fermentation product from cellulosic material typically involves pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis (saccharification), and fermentation.      The processing of cellulosic material according to the present invention can be accomplished using processes conventional in the art. Moreover, the methods of the present invention can be implemented using any conventional biomass processing apparatus configured to operate in accordance with the invention.      Hydrolysis (saccharification) and fermentation, separate or simultaneous, include, but are not limited to, separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF); simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF); simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation (SSCF); hybrid hydrolysis and fermentation (HHF); separate hydrolysis and co-fermentation (SHCF), (hybrid hydrolysis and fermentation (HHCF), and direct microbial conversion (DMC). SHF uses separate process steps to first enzymatically hydrolyze lignocellulose to fermentable sugars, e.g., glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, and pentose sugars, and then ferment the fermentable sugars to ethanol. In SSF, the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose and the fermentation of sugars to ethanol are combined in one step (Philippidis, G. P., 1996, Cellulose bioconversion technology, in Handbook on Bioethanol: Production and Utilization, Wyman, C. E., ed., Taylor & Francis, Washington, DC, 179-212). SSCF involves the cofermentation of multiple sugars (Sheehan, J., and Himmel, M., 1999, Enzymes, energy and the environment: A strategic perspective on the U.S. Department of Energy's research and development activities for bioethanol, Biotechnol. Prog. 15: 817-827). HHF involves a separate hydrolysis step, and in addition a simultaneous saccharification and hydrolysis step, which can be carried out in the same reactor. The steps in an HHF process can be carried out at different temperatures, i.e., high temperature enzymatic saccharification followed by SSF at a lower temperature that the fermentation strain can tolerate. DMC combines all three processes (enzyme production, lignocellulose hydrolysis, and fermentation) in one or more steps where the same organism is used to produce the enzymes for conversion of the lignocellulose to fermentable sugars and to convert the fermentable sugars into a final product (Lynd, L. R., Weimer, P. J., van Zyl, W. H., and Pretorius, I. S., 2002, Microbial cellulose utilization: Fundamentals and biotechnology, Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Reviews 66: 506-577). It is understood herein that any method known in the art comprising pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis (saccharification), fermentation, or a combination thereof can be used in the practicing the methods of the present invention.      A conventional apparatus can include a fed-batch stirred reactor, a batch stirred reactor, a continuous flow stirred reactor with ultrafiltration, and/or a continuous plug-flow column reactor (Fernanda de Castilhos Corazza, Flavio Faria de Moraes, Gisella Maria Zanin and Ivo Neitzel, 2003, Optimal control in fed-batch reactor for the cellobiose hydrolysis, Acta Scientiarum. Technology 25: 33-38; Gusakov, A. V., and Sinitsyn, A. P., 1985, Kinetics of the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose: 1. A mathematical model for a batch reactor process, Enz. Microb. Technol. 7: 346-352), an attrition reactor (Ryu, S. K., and Lee, J. M., 1983, Bioconversion of waste cellulose by using an attrition bioreactor, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 25: 53-65), or a reactor with intensive stirring induced by an electromagnetic field (Gusakov, A. V., Sinitsyn, A. P., Davydkin, I. Y., Davydkin, V. Y., Protas, O. V., 1996, Enhancement of enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis using a novel type of bioreactor with intensive stirring induced by electromagnetic field, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 56: 141-153). Additional reactor types include fluidized bed, upflow blanket, immobilized, and extruder type reactors for hydrolysis and/or fermentation.      Pretreatment. In practicing the methods of the present invention, any pretreatment process known in the art can be used to disrupt the plant cell wall components (Chandra et a/., 2007, Substrate pretreatment: The key to effective enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosics? Adv. Biochem. Engin. /Biotechnol. 108: 67-93; Galbe and Zacchi, 2007, Pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials for efficient bioethanol production, Adv. Biochem. Engin. / Biotech nol. 108: 41-65; Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009, Pretreatments to enhance the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass, Bioresource Technol. 100: 10-18; Mosier et al., 2005, Features of promising technologies for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass, Bioresource Technol. 96: 673-686; Taherzadeh and Karimi, 2008, Pretreatment of lignocellulosic wastes to improve ethanol and biogas production: A review, Int. J. of Mol. Sci. 9: 1621-1651 ; Yang and Wyman, 2008, Pretreatment: the key to unlocking low-cost cellulosic ethanol, Biofuels Bioproducts and Biorefining-Biofpr 2: 26-40).      Mechanical Pretreatment. The term ""mechanical pretreatment"" refers to various types of grinding or milling (e.g., dry milling, wet milling, or vibratory ball milling) to disrupt and/or reduce particle sizeplant cell wall components of the cellulosic material.      Chemical Pretreatment. In practicing the methods of the present invention, any chemical pretreatment process known in the art can be used to disrupt plant cell wall components of the cellulosic material (Chandra et al., 2007, supra; Galbe and Zacchi, 2007, Pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials for efficient bioethanol production, Adv. Biochem. Engin. / Biotech nol. 108: 41-65; Hendriks and Zeeman, 2009, Pretreatments to enhance the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass, Bioresource Technol. 100: 10-18; Mosier et al., 2005, Features of promising technologies for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass, Bioresource Technol. 96: 673-686; Taherzadeh and Karimi, 2008, Pretreatment of lignocellulosic wastes to improve ethanol and biogas production: A review, Int. J. of Mol. Sci. 9: 1621-1651 ; Yang and Wyman, 2008, Pretreatment: the key to unlocking low-cost cellulosic ethanol, Biofuels Bioproducts and Biorefining-Biofpr. 2: 26-40).      Conventional chemical pretreatments include, but are not limited to, steam pretreatment (with or without explosion), dilute acid pretreatment, hot water pretreatment, alkaline pretreatment, lime pretreatment, wet oxidation, wet explosion, ammonia fiber explosion, organosolv pretreatment, and biological pretreatment. Additional pretreatments include ammonia percolation, ultrasound, electroporation, microwave, supercritical C02, supercritical H20, ozone, and gamma irradiation pretreatments.      The cellulosic material can be chemically pretreated before hydrolysis and/or fermentation. Pretreatment is preferably performed prior to the hydrolysis. Alternatively, the pretreatment can be carried out simultaneously with enzyme hydrolysis to release fermentable sugars, such as glucose, cellobiose, and/or xylose. In most cases the pretreatment step itself can result in some conversion of the cellulosic material to fermentable sugars (even in absence of enzymes).      Steam Pretreatment: In steam pretreatment, the cellulosic material is heated to disrupt the plant cell wall components, including lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose to make the cellulose and other fractions, e.g., hemicellulose, accessible to enzymes. The cellulosic material is passed to or through a reaction vessel where steam is injected to increase the temperature to the required temperature and pressure and is retained therein for the desired reaction time. Steam pretreatment is preferably done at 140-230C, more preferably 160- 200C, and most preferably 170-190C, where the optimal temperature range depends on any addition of a chemical catalyst. Residence time for the steam pretreatment is preferably 1-15 minutes, more preferably 3-12 minutes, and most preferably 4-10 minutes, where the optimal residence time depends on temperature range and any addition of a chemical catalyst. Steam pretreatment allows for relatively high solids loadings, so that cellulosic material is generally only moist during the pretreatment. The steam pretreatment is often combined with an explosive discharge of the material after the pretreatment, which is known as steam explosion, that is, rapid flashing to atmospheric pressure and turbulent flow of the material to increase the accessible surface area by fragmentation (Duff and Murray, 1996, Bioresource Technology 855: 1-33; Galbe and Zacchi, 2002, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 59: 618-628; U.S. Patent Application No. 20020164730). During steam pretreatment, hemicellulose acetyl groups are cleaved and the resulting acid autocatalyzes partial hydrolysis of the hemicellulose to monosaccharides and oligosaccharides. Lignin is removed to only a limited extent.      A catalyst such as H2S04 or S02 (typically 0.3 to 3% w/w) is often added prior to steam pretreatment, which decreases the time and temperature, increases the recovery, and improves enzymatic hydrolysis (Ballesteros et al., 2006, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 129- 132: 496-508; Varga et al., 2004, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1 13-1 16: 509-523; Sassner et al., 2006, Enzyme Microb. Technol. 39: 756-762).      Chemical Pretreatment: The term ""chemical treatment"" refers to any chemical pretreatment that promotes the separation and/or release of cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or lignin. Examples of suitable chemical pretreatment processes include, for example, dilute acid pretreatment, lime pretreatment, wet oxidation, ammonia fiber/freeze explosion (AFEX), ammonia percolation (APR), and organosolv pretreatments.      In dilute acid pretreatment, the cellulosic material is mixed with dilute acid, typically H2S04, and water to form a slurry, heated by steam to the desired temperature, and after a residence time flashed to atmospheric pressure. The dilute acid pretreatment can be performed with a number of reactor designs, e.g., plug-flow reactors, counter-current reactors, or continuous counter-current shrinking bed reactors (Duff and Murray, 1996, supra; Schell et al., 2004, Bioresource Technol. 91 : 179-188; Lee et al., 1999, Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 65: 93-1 15).      Several methods of pretreatment under alkaline conditions can also be used. These alkaline pretreatments include, but are not limited to, lime pretreatment, wet oxidation, ammonia percolation (APR), and ammonia fiber/freeze explosion (AFEX). Lime pretreatment is performed with calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, or ammonia at low temperatures of 85-150C and residence times from 1 hour to several days (Wyman et al., 2005, Bioresource Technol. 96: 1959-1966; Mosier et al., 2005, Bioresource Technol. 96: 673-686). WO 2006/1 10891 , WO 2006/1 1899, WO 2006/11900, and WO 2006/1 10901 disclose pretreatment methods using ammonia.      Wet oxidation is a thermal pretreatment performed typically at 180-200C for 5-15 minutes with addition of an oxidative agent such as hydrogen peroxide or over-pressure of oxygen (Schmidt and Thomsen, 1998, Bioresource Technol. 64: 139-151 ; Palonen et al., 2004, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 117: 1-17; Varga et al., 2004, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 88: 567-574; Martin et al., 2006, J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol. 81 : 1669-1677). The pretreatment is performed at preferably 1-40% dry matter, more preferably 2-30% dry matter, and most preferably 5-20% dry matter, and often the initial pH is increased by the addition of alkali such as sodium carbonate.      A modification of the wet oxidation pretreatment method, known as wet explosion (combination of wet oxidation and steam explosion), can handle dry matter up to 30%. In wet explosion, the oxidizing agent is introduced during pretreatment after a certain residence time.     The pretreatment is then ended by flashing to atmospheric pressure (WO 2006/032282).      Ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX) involves treating the cellulosic material with liquid or gaseous ammonia at moderate temperatures such as 90-100C and high pressure such as 17- 20 bar for 5-10 minutes, where the dry matter content can be as high as 60% (Gollapalli et al.,     2002, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 98: 23-35; Chundawat et al., 2007, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 96:     219-231 ; Alizadeh et al., 2005, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 121 : 1 133-1141 ; Teymouri et al.,     2005, Bioresource Technol. 96: 2014-2018). AFEX pretreatment results in the depolymerization of cellulose and partial hydrolysis of hemicellulose. Lignin-carbohydrate complexes are cleaved.      Organosolv pretreatment delignifies the cellulosic material by extraction using aqueous ethanol (40-60% ethanol) at 160-200C for 30-60 minutes (Pan et al., 2005, Biotechnol. Bioeng.     90: 473-481 ; Pan et al., 2006, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 94: 851-861 ; Kurabi et al., 2005, Appl.     Biochem. Biotechnol. 121 : 219-230). Sulphuric acid is usually added as a catalyst. In organosolv pretreatment, the majority of hemicellulose is removed.      Other examples of suitable pretreatment methods are described by Schell et al., 2003,     Appl. Biochem. and Biotechnol. Vol. 105-108, p. 69-85, and Mosier et al., 2005, Bioresource     Technology 96: 673-686, and U.S. Published Application 2002/0164730.      In one aspect, the chemical pretreatment is preferably carried out as an acid treatment, and more preferably as a continuous dilute and/or mild acid treatment. The acid is typically sulfuric acid, but other acids can also be used, such as acetic acid, citric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, hydrogen chloride, or mixtures thereof. Mild acid treatment is conducted in the pH range of preferably 1-5, more preferably 1-4, and most preferably 1-3. In one aspect, the acid concentration is in the range from preferably 0.01 to 20 wt% acid, more preferably 0.05 to 10 wt% acid, even more preferably 0.1 to 5 wt% acid, and most preferably 0.2 to 2.0 wt% acid. The acid is contacted with the cellulosic material and held at a temperature in the range of preferably 160-220C, and more preferably 165-195C, for periods ranging from seconds to minutes to, e.g., 1 second to 60 minutes.      In another aspect, pretreatment is carried out as an ammonia fiber explosion step (AFEX pretreatment step).      In another aspect, pretreatment takes place in an aqueous slurry. In preferred aspects, the cellulosic material is present during pretreatment in amounts preferably between 10-80 wt%, more preferably between 20-70 wt%, and most preferably between 30- 60 wt%, such as around 50 wt%. The pretreated cellulosic material can be unwashed or washed using any method known in the art, e.g., washed with water.      Biological Pretreatment: The term ""biological pretreatment"" refers to any biological pretreatment that promotes the separation and/or release of cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or lignin from the cellulosic material. Biological pretreatment techniques can involve applying lignin-solubilizing microorganisms (see, for example, Hsu, T.-A., 1996, Pretreatment of biomass, in Handbook on Bioethanol: Production and Utilization, Wyman, C. E., ed., Taylor & Francis, Washington, DC, 179-212; Ghosh and Singh, 1993, Physicochemical and biological treatments for enzymatic/microbial conversion of cellulosic biomass, Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 39: 295-333; McMillan, J. D., 1994, Pretreating lignocellulosic biomass: a review, in Enzymatic Conversion of Biomass for Fuels Production, Himmel, M. E., Baker, J. O., and Overend, R. P., eds., ACS Symposium Series 566, American Chemical Society, Washington, DC, chapter 15; Gong, C. S., Cao, N. J., Du, J., and Tsao, G. T., 1999, Ethanol production from renewable resources, in Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology, Scheper, T., ed., Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, Germany, 65: 207-241 ; Olsson and Hahn-Hagerdal, 1996, Fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates for ethanol production, Enz. Microb. Tech. 18: 312-331 ; and Vallander and Eriksson, 1990, Production of ethanol from lignocellulosic materials: State of the art, Adv. Biochem. Eng./Biotechnol. 42: 63-95).      Physical Pretreatment. The term ""physical pretreatment"" refers to any pretreatment that promotes the separation and/or release of cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or lignin from the cellulosic material. For example, physical pretreatment can involve irradiation (e.g., microwave irradiation), steaming/steam explosion, hydrothermolysis, and combinations thereof.      Physical pretreatment can involve high pressure and/or high temperature (steam explosion). In one aspect, high pressure means pressure in the range of preferably about 300 to about 600 psi, more preferably about 350 to about 550 psi, and most preferably about 400 to about 500 psi, such as around 450 psi. In another aspect, high temperature means temperatures in the range of about 100 to about 300C, preferably about 140 to about 235C. In a preferred aspect, physical pretreatment is performed in a batch-process, steam gun hydrolyzer system that uses high pressure and high temperature as defined above, e.g., a Sunds Hydrolyzer available from Sunds Defibrator AB, Sweden.      The cellulosic material can be subjected to pre-soaking, wetting, washing, or conditioning prior to pretreatment using methods known in the art.      Combined Physical and Chemical Pretreatment: The cellulosic material can be pretreated both physically and chemically. For instance, the pretreatment step can involve dilute or mild acid treatment and high temperature and/or pressure treatment. The physical and chemical pretreatments can be carried out sequentially or simultaneously, as desired. A mechanical pretreatment can also be included.      Accordingly, in a preferred aspect, the cellulosic material is subjected to mechanical, chemical, or physical pretreatment, or any combination thereof, to promote the separation and/or release of cellulose, hemicellulose, and/or lignin.      Saccharification. In the hydrolysis step, also known as saccharification, the cellulosic material, e.g., pretreated, is hydrolyzed to break down cellulose and alternatively also hemicellulose to fermentable sugars, such as glucose, cellobiose, xylose, xylulose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, and/or soluble oligosaccharides. The hydrolysis is performed enzymatically by an enzyme composition of the present invention.      Enzymatic hydrolysis is preferably carried out in a suitable aqueous environment under conditions that can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. In a preferred aspect, hydrolysis is performed under conditions suitable for the activity of the enzyme(s), i.e., optimal for the enzyme(s). The hydrolysis can be carried out as a fed batch or continuous process where the pretreated cellulosic material (substrate) is fed gradually to, for example, an enzyme containing hydrolysis solution.      The saccharification is generally performed in stirred-tank reactors or fermentors under controlled pH, temperature, and mixing conditions. Suitable process time, temperature and pH conditions can readily be determined by one skilled in the art. For example, the saccharification can last up to 200 hours, but is typically performed for preferably about 12 to about 96 hours, more preferably about 16 to about 72 hours, and most preferably about 24 to about 48 hours. The temperature is in the range of preferably about 25C to about 70C, more preferably about 30C to about 65C, and more preferably about 40C to 60C, in particular about 50C. The pH is in the range of preferably about 3 to about 8, more preferably about 3.5 to about 7, and most preferably about 4 to about 6, in particular about pH 5. The dry solids content is in the range of preferably about 5 to about 50 wt%, more preferably about 10 to about 40 wt%, and most preferably about 20 to about 30 wt%.      In a preferred aspect, an effective amount of an enzyme composition of the present invention is about 0.5 to about 50 mg, preferably at about 0.5 to about 40 mg, more preferably at about 0.5 to about 30 mg, more preferably at about 0.75 to about 20 mg, more preferably at about 0.75 to about 15 mg, even more preferably at about 1 .0 to about 10 mg, and most preferably at about 2.0 to about 5 mg per g of cellulose in a cellulosic material.      Fermentation. The fermentable sugars obtained from the hydrolyzed cellulosic material can be fermented by one or more (several) fermenting microorganisms capable of fermenting the sugars directly or indirectly into a desired fermentation product. ""Fermentation"" or ""fermentation process"" refers to any fermentation process or any process comprising a fermentation step. Fermentation processes also include fermentation processes used in the consumable alcohol industry (e.g., beer and wine), dairy industry (e.g., fermented dairy products), leather industry, and tobacco industry. The fermentation conditions depend on the desired fermentation product and fermenting organism and can easily be determined by one skilled in the art.      In the fermentation step, sugars, released from cellulosic material as a result of the pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis steps, are fermented to a product, e.g., ethanol, by a fermenting organism, such as yeast. Hydrolysis (saccharification) and fermentation can be separate or simultaneous, as described herein.      Any suitable hydrolyzed cellulosic material can be used in the fermentation step in practicing the present invention. The material is generally selected based on the desired fermentation product, i.e., the substance to be obtained from the fermentation, and the process employed, as is well known in the art.      The term ""fermentation medium"" is understood herein to refer to a medium before the fermenting microorganism(s) is(are) added, such as, a medium resulting from a saccharification process, as well as a medium used in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process (SSF).      ""Fermenting microorganism"" refers to any microorganism, including bacterial and fungal organisms, suitable for use in a desired fermentation process to produce a fermentation product. The fermenting organism can be C6 and/or C5 fermenting organisms, or a combination thereof. Both C6 and C5 fermenting organisms are well known in the art. Suitable fermenting microorganisms are able to ferment, i.e., convert, sugars, such as glucose, xylose, xylulose, arabinose, maltose, mannose, galactose, or oligosaccharides, directly or indirectly into the desired fermentation product.      Examples of bacterial and fungal fermenting organisms producing ethanol are described by Lin et al., 2006, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 69: 627-642.

The cloning of heterologous genes into various fermenting microorganisms has led to the construction of organisms capable of converting hexoses and pentoses to ethanol (cofermentation) (Chen and Ho, 1993, Cloning and improving the expression of Pichia stipitis xylose reductase gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Appi.

In another preferred aspect, the genetically modified fermenting microorganism is Kluyveromyces sp.      It is well known in the art that the organisms described above can also be used to produce other substances, as described herein.      The fermenting microorganism is typically added to the degraded lignocellulose or hydrolysate and the fermentation is performed for about 8 to about 96 hours, such as about 24 to about 60 hours. The temperature is typically between about 26C to about 60C, in particular about 32C or 50C, and at about pH 3 to about pH 8, such as around pH 4-5, 6, or 7.      In a preferred aspect, the yeast and/or another microorganism is applied to the degraded cellulosic material and the fermentation is performed for about 12 to about 96 hours, such as typically 24-60 hours.

However, some fermenting organisms, e.g., bacteria, have higher fermentation temperature optima. Yeast or another microorganism is preferably applied in amounts of approximately 10<5> to 10<12>, preferably from approximately 10<7> to 10<10>, especially approximately 2 x 10<8> viable cell count per ml of fermentation broth. Further guidance in respect of using yeast for fermentation can be found in, e.g., ""The Alcohol Textbook"" (Editors K. Jacques, T.P. Lyons and D.R.

For ethanol production, following the fermentation the fermented slurry is distilled to extract the ethanol. The ethanol obtained according to the methods of the invention can be used as, e.g., fuel ethanol, drinking ethanol, i.e., potable neutral spirits, or industrial ethanol.      A fermentation stimulator can be used in combination with any of the processes described herein to further improve the fermentation process, and in particular, the performance of the fermenting microorganism, such as, rate enhancement and ethanol yield.

Example 1 : Preparation of Chaetomium thermophilum CGMCC 0581 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I      The Chaetomium thermophilum CGMCC 0581 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) gene (SEQ ID NO: 1 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 2 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was isolated according to WO 2003/000941 and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250 (WO 99/61651 ).      The fungal strain Chaetomium thermophilum CGMCC 0581 was grown on agar plate composed of 0.5% yeast extract, 1 % glucose and 2% agar for 3 days at 45  C. The fully grown culture was used to inoculate shake flasks containing liquid medium composed of 3% soymeal, 1 .5% maltose, and 0.5% peptone. The flasks were incubated at 45  C for 48 hours with shaking. The mycelia were harvested by centrifugation of the culture broth at 8000 rpm, 4C for 30 minutes, transferred into a clean plastic bag followed by immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80  C before total RNA was isolated.      The frozen mycelia were grounded into a very fine powder with a sterilized mortar and pestle baked at 200  C for 24 hours. An RNEASY<> Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) was used to isolate total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions.      First strand cDNA synthesis from the total RNA was performed using a 3' RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand cDNA of 3' RACE was used as PCR template for PCR screening.      Two oligonucleotides shown below were used for PCR screening of cDNA of Chaetomium thermophilum CGMCC 0581. The forward primer was derived from an alignment of conserved regions of cellobiohydrolase I genes and the reverse primer was provided by the 3' RACE System.      Forward primer:      5'-GGnACnGGnTA(t/c)TG(t/c)GA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 67)      Reverse primer:      5'-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 68)      One hundred picomoles of the forward primer and 10 picomoles of the reverse primer were used in a PCR reaction composed of 2  of the first strand cDNA of 3' RACE, 5  of 10X Taq DNA polymerase buffer (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wl, USA), 3  of 25 mM MgCI2, 1  of 10 mM dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wl, USA) in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed in a thermocycler programmed for 1 cycle at 95C for 3 minutes; 30 cycles each at 95C for 30 seconds, 50C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 50 seconds; and 1 cycle at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer where an approximately 1.3 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using a WIZARD PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wl, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR product was sequenced using a 377 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequencing showed that the 1.3 kb fragment was homologous to cellobiohydrolase I.      Two oligos shown below were designed for the 5' end cloning of the Chaetomium thermophilum CGMCC 0581 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I by using a 5' RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA).      Primer 4310AS1 :      5 -AGATATCCATCTCAGAGCA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 69)      Primer 4310AS2:      5'-GTTGGCATCATTGGTCG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 70)      The gene specific primer 4310AS1 was used for the first strand cDNA synthesis using a 5' RACE System according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand cDNA of 5' RACE (5 ) was used as template for PCR amplification composed of 5  of 10X Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 3  of 25 mM MgCI2, 1  of 10 mM dNTP, 1  of 10  4310AS2 primer, 1  of 10  primer AAP (Abridged Anchor Primer, provided by the kit), and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed in a thermocycler programmed for 1 cycle at 94C for 3 minutes; 30 cycles each at 95C for 30 seconds, 50C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 50 seconds; and 1 cycle at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The PCR products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer and purified using a WIZARD PCR Preps DMA Purification System. A dominant DNA fragment of 0.8 kb was confirmed to be the 5' end of Chaetomium thermophilum CGMCC 0581 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I gene by sequencing using a 377 DNA Analyzer.      Two primers shown below were designed based on the sequence information from both 5' and 3' end cloning. They were used for full-length cloning of the Chaetomium thermophilum CGMCC 0581 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I gene.      Primer 431 OS:      5'-ATCCTCTCCTTCCAGTTTTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 71 )      Primer 431 OAS:      5'-TATCCAAGTAGTCCACAACC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 72)      Ten picomoles of the above two primers were used in a PCR reaction composed of 5  of first strand cDNA of 3' RACE, 5  of 10X Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 3  of 25 mM     MgCI2, 1  of 10 mM dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a final volume of 50 .     The amplification was performed in a thermocycler programmed for 1 cycle at 95C for 3 minutes; 30 cycles each at 95C for 50 seconds, 55C for 50 seconds, and 72C for 90 seconds; and 1 cycle at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer where an approximately 1.5 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using a WIZARD PCR Preps DNA Purification System. The PCR fragment was then ligated to pGEM-T using a pGEM-T Vector System (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wl,     USA). The plasmid DNA was confirmed by sequencing using a 377 DNA Analyzer. The correct clone was designated pT43-10.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing Bsp HI sites at their ends, shown below, were designed to PCR amplify the full-length open reading frame of the Chaetomium thermophilum CGMCC 0581 Family GH7A cellobiohydrolase I gene. A Rapid Ligation Kit     (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used to clone the fragment into pAILo2     (WO 2004/099228).      PCR Forward primer:      5 -TCATGATGTACAAGAAGTTCGCCG-3 (SEQ ID NO: 73)      PCR Reverse primer:      5' -T CAT G ATT AC AG G C ACTG G CTGT AC-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 74)      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The underlined sequence contains sequence identity to the BspHI restriction site.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing 50 ng of plasmid pT43-10 containing the Chaetomium thermophilum CGMCC 0581 cellobiohydrolase I gene, 1X Pwo Amplification Buffer with MgS04 (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA), 4  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 2.5 units of Pwo DNA Polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA), in a final volume of 50 . A DNA ENGINE Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to amplify the fragment programmed for one cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; 35 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 62C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 1.5 minutes. After the 35 cycles, the reaction was incubated at 72C for 10 minutes and then cooled at 10C until further processed.      A 1 .6 kb PCR reaction product was isolated on a 0.8% GTG agarose gel (Cambrex Bioproducts, East Rutherford, NJ, USA) using 40 mM Tris base-20 mM sodium acetate-1 mM disodium EDTA (TAE) buffer and 0.1 g of ethidium bromide per ml. The DNA band was visualized with the aid of a DARKREADER Transilluminator (Clare Chemical Research, Dolores, CO, USA) to avoid UV-induced mutations. The 1.6 kb DNA band was excised with a disposable razor blade and purified with an ULTRAFREE DA spin cup (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The purified PCR fragment was cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a TOPO Blunt Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR clones containing the coding regions of interest were sequenced to Phred Q values of at least 40 to insure that there were no PCR induced errors. All sequence aligments were performed with Consed (University of Washington). One of the clones was determined to have the expected sequence and was selected and re-named CtPCR. The CtPCR clone containing the C. thermophilum cellobiohydrolase I coding region was digested with Bsp HI and gel purified as described above. This DNA fragment was then ligated into the Nco I restriction site of pAILo2 with a Rapid Ligation Kit. Expression clones were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequenced to confirm that the junction vector-insert was correct. Plasmid DNA for transformation was prepared with a Midi-Prep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The final clone was renamed pAILo4.      Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422. Eight micrograms of pAILo4 (as well as pAILo2 as a vector control) were used to transform Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250 protoplasts. Twelve transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates and incubated for 5 days at 34C. Confluent spore plates were washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 80 and the spore suspension was used to inoculate 25 ml of MDU2BP medium in 125 ml glass shake flasks. Transformant cultures were incubated at 34C with constant shaking at 200 rpm. At day five post-inoculation, cultures were centrifuged at 6000 x g and their supernatants collected. Five microliters of each supernatant were mixed with an equal volume of 2X loading buffer (10% beta-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a 1.5 mm 8%-16% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel and stained with SIMPLY BLUE SafeStain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). SDS-PAGE profiles of the culture broths showed that twelve out of twelve transformants had a new protein band of approximately 66 kDa. Transformant number 12 was selected and designated A. oryzae Jal250AILo4.      Shake flask medium was composed per liter of 50 g of glucose, 2 g of MgSCy7H20,     10 g of KH2P04, 2 g of K2S04, 0.5 g of CaCI2-2H20, 2 g of citric acid, 10 g of yeast extract, 0.5 g of AMG trace metals solution, and 2g of urea.

Air was added to the vessel at a rate of 1 vvm and the broth was agitated by Rushton impeller rotating at 1 100 rpm. Feed was started at a rate of 4 g per hour when the batch sucrose was consumed as indicated by a rise in the dissolved oxygen reading (at approximately 18-24 hours). At the end of the fermentation, whole broth was harvested from the vessel and centrifuged at 3000 x g to remove the biomass. The supernatant was sterile filtered and stored at 5 to 10C.      A 350 ml (3.15 g total protein) aliquot of the filtered A. oryzae Jal250AILo4 fermentation broth (AOC18-7) containing recombinant Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I was concentrated and desalted, and then purified over a Q SEPHAROSE Big Bead column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8, over a linear 0 to 1 M NaCI gradient.

The 1.3 kb DNA band was excised with a disposable razor blade and purified using a JETSORB Gel Extraction Kit (Genomed GmbH, Lohne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The purified PCR fragment was cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR clones containing the coding regions of interest were sequenced. One of the clones having the expected sequence was selected and named pDAu27#15.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing a Bsp HI restriction site on the forward primer and a Pac I restriction site on the reverse primer, shown below, were designed to PCR amplify the full-length open reading frame of the Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 1 17.65 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I from pDAu27#15. A Rapid Ligation Kit was used to clone the fragment into pAILo2 (WO 2004/099228).      PCR Forward primer:      5 -TCATGAAGCAGTACCTCCAGTA-3 (SEQ ID NO: 77)      PCR Reverse primer:      5 -TTAATTAATTAGACGTTGACAGTCGAGC-3 (SEQ ID NO: 78)      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The underlined sequence contains sequence identity to the Bsp HI and Pac I restriction sites.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing     50 ng of plasmid pDAu27#15 containing the Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 1 17.65 cellobiohydrolase I I gene, 1 X Pfx Amplification Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 6  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 2.5 units of PLATINUM Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1  of 50 mM MgS04, and 2.5  of 10X pCRx Enhancer solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a final volume of 50 . A DNA ENGINE Thermal Cycler was used to amplify the fragment programmed for one cycle at 98C for 2 minutes; and 35 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 58C for 30 seconds, and 68C for 1.5 minutes. After the 35 cycles, the reaction was incubated at 68C for 10 minutes and then cooled at 10C until further processed.      A 1.3 kb PCR reaction product was isolated on a 0.8% GTG agarose gel using TAE buffer and 0.1 g of ethidium bromide per ml. The DNA band was visualized with the aid of a DARKREADER Transilluminator to avoid UV-induced mutations. The 1.3 kb DNA band was excised with a disposable razor blade and purified with an ULTRAFREE DA spin cup according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The purified PCR fragment was cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR clones containing the coding region of interest were sequenced to Phred Q values of at least 40 to insure that there were no PCR induced errors. All sequence aligments were performed with Consed (University of Washington). One of the clones that was shown to have the expected sequence was selected and re-named MtPCR. The MtPCR clone containing the M. thermophila cellobiohydrolase I coding region was double digested with Bsp HI and Bss SI and a 352 bp fragment was gel purified as described above. Another aliquot of MtPCR was also double digested with Bss SI and Pac I and a 1009 bp fragment was gel purified as described above. These DNA fragments were then ligated into pAILo2 previously digested with Nco I and Pac I in a three-way ligation using a Rapid Ligation Kit. Expression clones were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequenced to confirm that the junction vector-insert was correct. Plasmid DNA for transformation was prepared with a Midi-Prep Kit. The final clone was re-named pAILol O.      Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, supra. Six micrograms of pAILol O (as well as pAILo2 as a vector control) were used to transform Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250 protoplasts. Eight transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates and incubated for five days at 34C. Confluent spore plates were washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 80 and the spore suspension was used to inoculate 25 ml of MDU2BP medium in 125 ml glass shake flasks. Transformant cultures were incubated at 34C with constant shaking at 200 rpm. At day five post-inoculation, cultures were centrifuged at 6000 x g and their supernatants collected. Five microliters of each supernatant were mixed with an equal volume of 2X loading buffer (10% beta- mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a 1 .5 mm 8%-16% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel and stained with SIMPLY BLUE SafeStain. SDS-PAGE profiles of the culture broths showed that eight out of eight transformants had a new protein band of approximately 50 kDa. Transformant number 8 was selected for further studies and designated A. oryzae JaL250AILo10.      A new fully confluent spore plate was prepared as described above. Spores were collected with 5 ml of an aqueous solution of 0.01 % TWEEN 80 and two more washes with MDU2BP medium to maximize the number of spores collected. The spore suspension was then used to inoculate 500 ml of MDU2BP medium in a two-liter Fernbach flask. The A. oryzae JaL250AILo10 liquid culture was then incubated at 34C with shaking at 200 rpm. At day five post-inoculation the culture broth was collected by filtration on a 500 milliliter, 75 mm Nylon filter unit with a pore size of 0.45 .      The culture filtrate was desalted and buffer exchanged in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCI pH 8.5, using a HIPREP 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 3: Preparation of Aspergillus fumigatus NN055679 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I A tfasty search (Pearson et al., 1997, Genomics 46:24-36) of the Aspergillus fumigatus partial genome sequence (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) was performed using as query a Cel7 cellobiohydrolase protein sequence from Trichoderma reesei (Accession No. P00725). Several genes were identified as putative Family GH7 homologs based upon a high degree of similarity to the query sequence at the amino acid level. One genomic region with significant identity to the query sequence was chosen for further study, and the corresponding gene was named cell A.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below were designed to PCR amplify an Aspergillus fumigatus NN055679 cellA cellobiohydrolase I gene (SEQ ID NO: 5 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 6 [deduced amino acid sequence]) from genomic DNA of Aspergillus fumigatus prepared as described in WO 2005/047499.      Forward primer:      5'-gggcATGCTGGCCTCCACCTTCTCC-3' (SEQ I D NO: 79)      Reverse primer:      5'-gggttaattaaCTACAGGCACTGAGAGTAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 80)      Upper case letters represent the coding sequence. The remainder of the sequence provides restriction endonuclease sites for Sph I and Pac I in the forward and reverse sequences, respectively. Using these primers, the Aspergillus fumigatus cellA gene was amplified using standard PCR methods and the reaction product isolated by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer and purified using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The fragment was digested with Sph I and Pac I and ligated into the expression vector pAILo2 also digested with Sph I and Pac I according to standard procedures. The ligation products were transformed into E. coli XL10 SOLOPACK cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An E. coli transformant containing a plasmid of the correct size was detected by restriction digestion and plasmid DNA was prepared using a BIOROBOT 9600 (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). DNA sequencing of the insert gene from this plasmid was performed with a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Model 377 XL Automated DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) using dye-terminator chemistry (Giesecke et al., 1992, Journal of Virology Methods 38: 47-60) and primer walking strategy. Nucleotide sequence data were scrutinized for quality and all sequences were compared to each other with assistance of PHRED/PHRAP software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA). The nucleotide sequence was shown to match the genomic sequence determined by TIGR (SEQ I D NO: 5 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 6 [deduced amino acid sequence]). The resulting plasmid was named pEJG93.      Aspergillus oryzae JaL250 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, supra. Five g of pEJG93 (as well as pAILo2 as a vector control) was used to transform Aspergillus oryzae JaL250.      The transformation of Aspergillus oryzae JaL250 with pEJG93 yielded about 100 transformants. Ten transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates.      Confluent PDA plates of five of the ten transformants were washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and inoculated separately into 25 ml of MDU2BP medium in 125 ml glass shake flasks and incubated at 34C, 250 rpm. Five days after incubation, 0.5  of supernatant from each culture was analyzed using 8-16% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that one of the transformants had a major band of approximately 70 kDa. This transformant was named Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250EJG93.      Five hundred ml of shake flask medium were added to a 2800 ml shake flask. The shake flask medium was composed of 45 g of maltose, 2 g of K2HP04, 12 g of KH2P04, 1 g of NaCI, 1 g of MgS04-7H20, 7 g of yeast extract, 2 g of urea, and 0.5 ml of trace elements solution. The trace elements solution was composed per liter of 13.8 g of FeSCy7H20, 14.3 g of ZnS04-7H20, 8.5 g of MnS04-H20, 2.5 g of CuSCy5H20, 0.5 g of NiCI2-6H20, 3 g of citric acid, and deionized water to 1 liter. Two shake flasks were inoculated with a suspension of a PDA plate of Aspergillus oryzae JaL250EJG93 with 0.01 % TWEEN 80 and incubated at 34C on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm for 120 hours. The broth was filtered usinga 0.7  Whatman glass filter GF/F (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ, USA) followed by a 0.22  EXPRESS Plus Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).      Filtered broth was concentrated and buffer exchanged using a tangential flow concentrator (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA, USA) equipped with a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA, USA) with 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.5. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Example 4: Preparation of Thermoascus aurantiacus CGMCC 0583 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I      The Thermoascus aurantiacus CGMCC 0583 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) gene (SEQ ID NO: 7 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 8 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was isolated according to WO 2003/000941 and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250.      The fungal strain Thermoascus aurantiacus CGMCC 0583 was grown on an agar plate composed of 0.5% yeast extract, 1 % glucose, and 2% agar for 3 days at 45  C. The fully grown culture was used to inoculate shake flasks containing liquid medium composed of 3% soymeal, 1.5% maltose, and 0.5% peptone. The flasks were incubated at 45  C for 48 hours with shaking. The mycelia were harvested by centrifugation of the culture broth at 8000 rpm, 4  C for 30 minutes, transferred into a clean plastic bag followed by immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80  C before total RNA was isolated.      The frozen mycelia were grounded into a very fine powder with a sterilized mortar and pestle baked at 200  C for 24 hours. An RNEASY<> Plant Mini Kit was used to isolate total RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions.      First strand cDNA synthesis from the total RNA was performed using a 3' RACE     System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand cDNA of 3' RACE was used as PCR template for PCR screening.      Two oligonucleotides shown below were used for PCR screening of cDNA of Thermoascus aurantiacus CGMCC 0583. The forward primer was derived from an alignment of conserved regions of cellobiohydrolase I genes and the reverse primer was provided by the 3' RACE System.      Forward primer:      5'-GGnACnGGnTA(t c)TG(t/c)GA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 81 )      Reverse primer:      5'-TCnA(a/g)CCAnA(a/g)CAT(a/g)TT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 82)      One hundred picomoles of the above primers were used in a PCR reaction composed of 2  of the first strand cDNA of 3' RACE, 5  of 10X Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 3  of 25 mM MgCI2, 1  of 10 mM dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed in a thermocycler programmed for 1 cycle at 95C for 3 minutes; 30 cycles each at 95C for 30 seconds, 50C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 50 seconds; and 1 cycle at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer where an approximately 0.65 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using a WIZARD PCR Preps DNA Purification System according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR product was sequenced using a 377 DNA Analyzer. Sequencing showed that the 0.65 kb fragment was homologous to cellobiohydrolase I.      Two oligos were designed for 5' end cloning of Thermoascus aurantiacus CGMCC     0583 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I by using a 5' RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA     Ends.      Primer 025AS1 :      5'-GTAGAGATGCTGTTGGCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 83)      Primer 025AS1.5:      5'-TCTCAGCGCAGCAG G AAC C G T- 3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 84)      The gene specific primer 025AS1 was used for first strand cDNA synthesis using the 5' RACE System according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand cDNA of 5' RACE was used as template for a PCR amplification composed of 5  of 10X Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 3  of 25 mM MgCI2, 1  of 10 mM dNTP, 2  of 10  primer 025AS1 .5, 2  of 10  primer AAP (Abridged Anchor Primer, provided by the kit), and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed in a thermocycler programmed for 1 cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; 30 cycles each at 94C for 40 seconds, 55C for 40 seconds, and 72C for 60 seconds; and 1 cycle at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle. The PCR products were isolated by 1 .0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer and purified using a WIZARD PCR Preps DNA Purification System. A dominant DNA fragment at 0.8 kb was confirmed to be the 5' end of Thermoascus aurantiacus CGMCC 0583 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I gene by sequencing using a 377 DNA Analyzer.      One forward primer, 1 F shown below, was designed based on the sequence information of the 5' end cloning. Primer 1 F was used for the full-length cloning of the Thermoascus aurantiacus CGMCC 0583 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I gene together with primer AUAP (provided by the kit) as the reverse primer.      Primer 1 F:      5 '-AG C G AC AG C AAT AAC AAT-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 85)      Ten picomoles of the above 2 primers were used in a PCR reaction composed of the     4  of first strand cDNA of 3' RACE, 5  of 10X Taq DNA polymerase buffer, 3  of 25 mM MgCI21  of 10 mM dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed in a thermocycler programmed for 1 cycle at 95C for 2 minutes; 30 cycles each at 95C for 40 seconds, 58C for 40 seconds, and 72C for 90 seconds; and 1 cycle at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer where an approximately 1.7 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using a WIZARD PCR Preps DNA Purification System. The PCR fragment was then ligated to pGEM-T using a pGEM-T Vector System. The plasmid DNA was confirmed by sequencing using a 377 DNA Analyzer. The correct clone was designated pT002-5.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below containing Bsp LU1 1 I sites on the forward primer and Pac I at the reverse primer were designed to PCR amplify the full- length open reading frame of the Thermoascus aurantiacus CGMCC 0583 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I gene. A Rapid Ligation Kit was used to clone the fragment into pAILo2. PCR Forward primer:      5 -ACATGTATCAGCGCGCTCTTCTC-3 (SEQ ID NO: 86)      PCR Reverse primer:      5 -TTAATTAATTAGTTGGCGGTGAAGGTCG-3 (SEQ ID NO: 87)      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The underlined sequence contains sequence identity to the Bsp LU1 1 1 and Pac I restriction sites.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing     50 ng of plasmid pT002-5, 1X Pwo Amplification Buffer with MgS04, 4  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 2.5 units of Pwo DNA Polymerase, in a final volume of 50 . A DNA ENGINE Thermal Cycler was used to amplify the fragment programmed for one cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; and 25 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 59C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 1.5 minutes. After the 25 cycles, the reaction was incubated at 72C for 10 minutes and then cooled at 10C until further processed.      A 1 .3 kb PCR reaction product was isolated on a 0.8% GTG agarose gel using TAE buffer and 0.1 g of ethidium bromide per ml. The DNA band was visualized with the aid of a DARKREADER Transilluminator to avoid UV-induced mutations. The 1.3 kb DNA band was excised with a disposable razor blade and purified with an ULTRAFREE DA spin cup according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The purified PCR fragment was cloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR clones containing the coding region of interest were sequenced to Phred Q values of at least 40 to insure that there were no PCR induced errors. All sequence aligments were performed with Consed (University of Washington). One of the clones that was shown to have the expected sequence was selected and re-named TaPCR. The TaPCR clone containing the T. aurantiacus cellobiohydrolase I coding region was double digested with the restriction enzymes Bsp LU1 1 I and Pac I and gel purified as described above. This DNA fragment was then ligated into pAILo2 previously digested with Nco I and Pac I using a Rapid Ligation Kit. Expression clones were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequenced to confirm that the junction vector-insert was correct. Plasmid DNA for transformation was prepared with a Midi-Prep Kit. The final clone was re-named pAILo6.      Aspergillus oryzae JaL250 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, supra. Ten micrograms of pAILo6 were used to transform the Aspergillus oryzae JaL250 protoplasts. Twelve transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates and incubated for 5 days at 34C. Confluent spore plates were washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 80 and the spore suspension was used to inoculate 25 ml of MDU2BP medium in 125 ml glass shake flasks. Transformant cultures were incubated at 34C with constant shaking at 200 rpm. At day five post-inoculation, cultures were centrifuged at 6000 x g and their supernatants collected. Five microliters of each supernatant were mixed with an equal volume of 2X loading buffer (10% beta-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 1 .5 mm 8%-16% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel and stained with SIMPLY BLUE SafeStain. SDS-PAGE profiles of the culture broths showed that eleven out of twelve transformants had a new protein band of approximately 60 kDa. Transformant number 12 was selected for further studies and designated A. oryzae JaL250AILo6.      A spore stock suspension was prepared from a 5 day plate culture of A. oryzae JaL250AILo6 by adding 10 ml of 0.1 % TWEEN 20 to the culture plate to release the spores. A shake flask culture was started by inoculating 100  of the spore stock to a 250 ml baffled flask containing 50 ml of M410 medium pH 6.0. The shake flask was grown at 34C for 5 days with shaking a 250 rpm. The culture was filtered through a 0.2  pore filter device and the filtrate was recovered for protein purification. A 50 ml volume of the filtrate was desalted and buffer exchanged in 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 using an ECONO-PAC 10-DG desalting column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 5: Preparation of Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 117.65 Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II      The Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 1 17.65 Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II (SEQ ID NO: 9 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 10 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      One hundred ml of shake flask medium was added to a 500 ml shake flask. The shake flask medium was composed per liter of 15 g of glucose, 4 g of K2HP04, 1 g of NaCI, 0.2 g of MgS04-7H20, 2 g of MES free acid, 1 g of Bacto Peptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 2.5 g of citric acid, 0.2 g of CaCI2-2H20, 5 g of NH4N03, and 1 ml of trace elements solution. The trace elements solution was composed per liter of 1.2 g of FeS04-7H20, 10 g of ZnS04-7H20, 0.7 g of MnS04-H20, 0.4 g of CuS04-5H20, 0.4 g of Na2B4O7-10H2O, and 0.8 g of Na2Mo02-2H20. The shake flask was inoculated with two plugs from a solid plate culture of Myceliophthora thermophila strain CBS 1 17.65 and incubated at 45C with shaking at 200 rpm for 48 hours. Fifty ml of the shake flask broth was used to inoculate a 2 liter fermentation vessel.      Fermentation batch medium was composed per liter of 5 g of yeast extract, 176 g of powdered cellulose, 2 g of glucose, 1 g of NaCI, 1 g of Bacto Peptone, 4 g of K2HP04, 0.2 g of CaCI2-2H20, 0.2 g of MgS04.7H20, 2.5 g of citric acid, 5 g of NH4N03, 1 .8 ml of anti-foam, and 1 ml of trace elements solution (above). Fermentation feed medium was composed of water and antifoam.      A total of 1.8 liters of the fermentation batch medium was added to a two liter glass jacketed fermentor (Applikon Biotechnology, Schiedam, Netherlands). Fermentation feed medium was dosed at a rate of 4 g/l/hr for a period of 72 hours. The fermentation vessel was maintained at a temperature of 45C and pH was controlled using an Applikon 1030 control system (Applikon Biotechnology, Schiedam, Netherlands) to a set-point of 5.6 +/- 0.1. Air was added to the vessel at a rate of 1 vvm and the broth was agitated by Rushton impeller rotating at 1 100 to 1300 rpm. At the end of the fermentation, whole broth was harvested from the vessel and centrifuged at 3000 x g to remove the biomass.      The harvested broth obtained above was centrifuged in 500 ml bottles at 13,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4C and then sterile filtered using a 0.22  polyethersulfone membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The filtered broth was concentrated and buffer exchanged with 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.5 using a tangential flow concentrator equipped with a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane at approximately 20 psi. To decrease the amount of pigment, the concentrate was applied to a 60 ml Q SEPHAROSE Big Bead column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.5, and step eluted with equilibration buffer containing 600 mM NaCI. Flow-through and eluate fractions were examined on 8-16% CRITERION SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) stained with GELCODE Blue Stain Reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The flow-through fraction contained the Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A cellobiohydrolase as judged by the presence of a band corresponding to the apparent molecular weight of the protein by SDS- PAGE (approximately 75 kDa).      The flow-through fraction was concentrated using an ultrafiltration device (Millipore,     Bedford, MA, USA) equipped with a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane at 40 psi, 4C and mixed with an equal volume of 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5 containing 3.4 M ammonium sulfate for a final concentration of 1 .7 M ammonium sulfate. The sample was filtered (0.2  syringe filter, polyethersulfone membrane, Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom) to remove particulate matter prior to loading onto a PHENYL SUPEROSE column (HR 16/10, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated with 1 .7 M ammonium sulfate in 20 mM Tris- HCI pH 7.5. Bound proteins were eluted with a 12 column volume decreasing salt gradient of 1.7 M ammonium sulfate to 0 M ammonium sulfate in 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5. Fractions were analyzed by 8-16% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis as described above, which revealed that the Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A cellobiohydrolase eluted at the very end of the gradient (approximately 20 mM ammonium sulfate).      Fractions containing the Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II were pooled and diluted 10-fold in 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 9.0 (to lower the salt and raise the pH) and then applied to a 1 ml RESOURCE Q column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 9.0. Bound proteins were eluted with a 20 column volume salt gradient from 0 mM to 550 mM NaCI in 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 9.0. M. thermophila Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II eluted as a single peak early in the gradient (-25 mM NaCI). The cellobiohydrolase II was >90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 6: Preparation of recombinant Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 202.75 Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II      Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 202.75 was grown in 100 ml of YEG medium in a baffled shake flask at 45C for 2 days with shaking at 200 rpm. Mycelia were harvested by filtration using MIRACLOTH (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA), washed twice in deionized water, and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder, and total DNA was isolated using a DNEASY Plant Maxi Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).      A full-length Family 6 cellobiohydrolase gene (Cel6A) was isolated from Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 202.75 using a GENOMEWALKER Universal Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, total genomic DNA from Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 202.75 was digested separately with four different restriction enzymes (Dra I, Eco RV, Pvu II, and Stu I) that leave blunt ends. Each batch of digested genomic DNA was then ligated separately to the GENOMEWALKER Adaptor (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) to create four libraries. These libraries were then employed as templates in PCR reactions using two gene-specific primers shown below, one for primary PCR and one for secondary PCR. The primers were designed based on a partial Family 6 cellobiohydrolase gene (Cel6A) sequence from Myceliophthora thermophila (WO 2004/056981 ).      Primer MtCel6A-R4:      5 -ATTGGCAGCCCGGATCTGGGACAGAGTCTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 88)      Primer MtCel6A-R5:      5 -CCGGTCATGCTAGGAATGGCGAGATTGTGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 89)      The primary amplifications were composed of 1  (approximately 6 ng) of each library as template, 0.4 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 10 pmol of Adaptor Primer 1 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), 10 pmol of primer MtCel6A-R4, 1X ADVANTAGE GC-Melt LA Buffer (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), and 1 .25 units of ADVANTAGE GC Genomic Polymerase Mix (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) in a final volume of 25 . The amplification reactions were incubated in an EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 (Eppendorf Scientific, Inc., Westbury, NY, USA) programmed for pre-denaturing at 94C for 1 minute; 7 cycles each at a denaturing temperature of 94C for 30 seconds; annealing and elongation at 72C for 5 minutes; and 32 cycles each at 67C for 5 minutes.      The secondary ampliifications were composed of 1  of each primary PCR product as template, 0.4 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 10 pmol of Adaptor Primer 2 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), 10 pmol of primer MtCel6A-R5, 1X ADVANTAGE GC-Melt LA Buffer, and 1.25 units of ADVANTAGE GC Genomic Polymerase Mix in a final volume of 25 . The amplifications were incubated in an EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 programmed for pre-denaturing at 94C for 1 minute; 5 cycles each at a denaturing temperature of 94C for 30 seconds; annealing and elongation at 72C for 5 minutes; and 20 cycles at 67C for 5 minutes. The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where a 3.5 kb product band from the Eco RV library was excised from the gel, purified using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, and sequenced.      DNA sequencing of the 3.5 kb PCR fragment was performed with a Perkin-Elmer     Applied Biosystems Model 377 XL Automated DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) using dye-terminator chemistry (Giesecke et al., 1992, Journal of Virology Methods 38: 47-60) and primer walking strategy. The following gene specific primers were used for sequencing:      MtCel6A-F2:      5'-GCTGTAAACTGCGAATGGGTTCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 90)      MtCel6A-F3:      5'-GGGTCCCACATGCTGCGCCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 91 )      MtCel6A-R8:      5'-AAAATTCACGAGACGCCGGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 92)      Nucleotide sequence data were scrutinized for quality and all sequences were compared to each other with assistance of PHRED/PHRAP software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA). The 3.5 kb sequence was compared and aligned with a partial Family 6 cellobiohydrolase gene (Cel6A) sequence from Myceliophthora thermophila (WO 2004/056981 ).      A gene model for the Myceliophthora thermophila sequence was constructed based on similarity of the encoded protein to homologous glycoside hydrolase Family 6 proteins from Thielavia terrestris, Chaetomium thermophilum, Humicola insolens, and Trichoderma reesei. The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the Myceliophthora thermophila CBS 202.75 Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II gene are shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 1 and SEQ ID NO: 12, respectively. The genomic fragment encodes a polypeptide of 482 amino acids, interrupted by 3 introns of 96, 87, and 180 bp. The% G+C content of the gene and the mature coding sequence are 61.6% and 64%, respectively. Using the SignalP software program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 17 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 465 amino acids with a molecular mass of 49.3 kDa.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below were designed to PCR amplify the Myceliophthora thermophila cellobiohydrolase gene from the genomic DNA prepared above for construction of an Aspergillus oryzae expression vector. An IN-FUSION Cloning Kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pAILo2, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      MtCel6A-F4: 5'-ACTGGATTTACCATGGCCAAGAAGCTTTTCATCACC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 93) MtCel6A-R9:      5'-TCACCTCTAGTTAATTAATTAGAAGGGCGGGTTGGCGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 94)      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pAILo2.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of 100 ng of Myceliophthora thermophila genomic DNA, 1X ADVANTAGE GC-Melt LA Buffer, 0.4 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 1.25 units of ADVANTAGE GC Genomic Polymerase Mix in a final volume of 25 . The amplification reaction was incubated in an EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 programmed for 1 cycle at 94C for 1 minutes; and 30 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 62C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1 .0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where a 1842 bp product band was excised from the gel, and purified using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      Plasmid pAILo2 was digested with Nco I and Pac I, isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer, and purified using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together using an IN- FUSION Cloning Kit resulting in pSMai180 in which transcription of the cellobiohydrolase gene was under the control of a NA2-tpi promoter (a modified promoter from the gene encoding neutral alpha-amylase in Aspergillus niger in which the untranslated leader has been replaced by an untranslated leader from the gene encoding triose phosphate isomerase in Aspergillus nidulans). The ligation reaction (50 ) was composed of 1X IN- FUSION Buffer (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 1X BSA (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 1  of IN-FUSION enzyme (diluted 1 :10) (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 100 ng of pAILo2 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 50 ng of the Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A purified PCR product. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. One  of the reaction was used to transform  coli XL10 SOLOPACK Gold cells. An  coli transformant containing pSMai180 was detected by restriction digestion and plasmid DNA was prepared using a BIOROBOT 9600. The Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A insert in pSMai180 was confirmed by DNA sequencing.      The same 1842 bp PCR fragment was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a TOPO TA CLONING Kit to generate pSMai182. The Myceliophthora thermophila cel6A gene insert in pSMai182 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. . coli pSMai182 was deposited with the Agricultural Research Service Patent Culture Collection, Northern Regional Research Center, 1815 University Street, Peoria, III., 61604, on Sept. 6, 2007.      The Myceliophthora thermophila Family 6 cellobiohydrolase Cel6A gene was expressed in Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355. A. oryzae Jal_355 (WO 2002/40694) protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, supra. Three g of pSMail 80 were used to transform Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355.      The transformation of Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355 with pSMai180 yielded about 50 transformants. Twenty transformants were isolated to individual Minimal medium plates.      Confluent Minimal Medium plates of the 20 transformants were washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and inoculated separately into 25 ml of MDU2BP medium in 125 ml glass shake flasks and incubated at 34C, 250 rpm. After 5 days incubation, 5  of supernatant from each culture were analyzed using 8-16% CRITERION SDS-PAGE gels and a CRITERION Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting gel was stained with BIO-SAFE Coomassie Stain (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the majority of the transformants had a major band of approximately 70 kDa.      A confluent plate of one transformant, designated transformant 14, was washed with 10 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and inoculated into a 2 liter Fernbach flask containing 500 ml of MDU2BP medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The culture was harvested on day 5 and filtered using a 0.22  EXPRESS Plus Membrane.      The filtered broth was concentrated and buffer exchanged using a tangential flow concentrator equipped with a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane with 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0. The concentrated and buffer exchanged broth was adjusted to 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0- 1.2 M (NH4)2S04 and applied to a Phenyl SUPEROSE column (HR 16/10) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0-1.2 M (NH4)2S04. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient over 10 column volumes from 300 to 0 mM (NH4)2S04 in 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0. SDS-PAGE of eluate fractions showed a major band at approximately 70 kDa. These fractions were then concentrated and buffer exchanged by centrifugal concentration using a VIVASPIN centrifugal concentrator (10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane, Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany) into 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 7: Preparation of Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II (CBHII)      Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II (SEQ ID NO: 13 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 14 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was recombinantly prepared according to WO 2006/074435 using Trichoderma reesei as a host.      Culture filtrate was desalted and buffer exchanged in 20 mM Tris-150 mM sodium chloride pH 8.5 using an ECONO-PAC 10-DG desalting column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 8: Preparation of Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 cellobiohydrolase II (CBHII)      The Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 cellobiohydrolase II (CBHII) (SEQ ID NO: 15 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 16 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was prepared as described below.      Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 was inoculated onto a PDA plate and incubated for 7 days at 28C. Several mycelia-PDA agar plugs were inoculated into 750 ml shake flasks containing 100 ml of MEX-1 medium. The flasks were incubated at 37C for 9 days with shaking at 150 rpm. The fungal mycelia were harvested by filtration through MIRACLOTH (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) before being frozen in liquid nitrogen. The mycelia were then pulverized into a powder by milling the frozen mycelia together with an equal volume of dry ice in a coffee grinder precooled with liquid nitrogen. The powder was transferred into a liquid nitrogen prechilled mortar and pestle and ground to a fine powder with a small amount of baked quartz sand. The powdered mycelial material was kept at -80C until use.      Total RNA was prepared from the frozen, powdered mycelia of Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 by extraction with guanidium thiocyanate followed by ultracentrifugation through a 5.7 M CsCI cushion according to Chirgwin et al., 1979, Biochemistry 18: 5294-5299. The polyA enriched RNA was isolated by oligo (dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography according to Aviv et al., 1972, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 69: 1408-1412.      Double stranded cDNA was synthesized according to the general methods of Gubler and Hoffman, 1983, Gene 25: 263-269; Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F., and Maniantis, T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2<nd> ed., 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; and Kofod et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269: 29182-29189, using a polyA-/ I primer (Promega Corp., Madison, Wisconsin, USA). After synthesis, the cDNA was treated with mung bean nuclease, blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated to a 50-fold molar excess of Eco Rl adaptors (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cDNA was cleaved with Not I and the cDNA was size fractionated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using in 44 mM Tris base, 44 mM boric acid, 0.5 mM EDTA (TBE) buffer. The fraction of cDNA of 700 bp and larger was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The prepared cDNA was then directionally cloned by ligation into Eco RI-/Vot I cleaved pMHas5 (WO 03/044049) using a Rapid Ligation Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ligation mixture was electroporated into E. coli DH10B cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a GENE PULSER and Pulse Controller (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) at 50 , 25 mAmp, 1.8 kV with a 2 mm gap cuvette according to the manufacturer's procedure.      The electroporated cells were spread onto LB plates supplemented with 50 g of kanamycin per ml. A cDNA plasmid pool was prepared from approximately 30,000 total transformants of the original cDNA-pMHas5 vector ligation. Plasmid DNA was prepared directly from the pool of colonies using a QIAPREP Spin Midi/Maxiprep Kit (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany). The cDNA library was designated SBL521-2.      A transposon containing plasmid designated pSigA4 was constructed from the pSigA2 transposon containing plasmid described in WO 01/77315 in order to create an improved version of the signal trapping transposon of pSigA2 with decreased selection background. The pSigA2 transposon contains a signal less beta-lactamase construct encoded on the transposon itself. PCR was used to create a deletion of the intact beta- lactamase gene found on the plasmid backbone using a proofreading PROOFSTART DNA polymerase (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany) and the following 5' phosphorylated primers (TAG Copenhagen, Denmark):      SigA2NotU-P:      5'-TCGCGATCCGTTTTCGCATTTATCGTGAAACGCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 95)      SigA2NotD-P:      5'-CCGCAAACGCTGGTGAAAGTAAAAGATGCTGAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 96)      The amplification reaction was composed of 1  of pSigA2 (10 ng/ ), 5  of 10X ProofStart Buffer (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany), 2.5  of dNTP mix (20 mM), 0.5  of SigA2NotU-P (10 mM), 0.5  of SigA2NotD-P (10 mM), 10  of Q solution (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany), and 31.25  of deionized water. A DNA ENGINE Thermal Cycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was used for the amplification programmed for 1 cycle at 95C for 5 minutes; and 20 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 62C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 4 minutes.      A 3.9 kb PCR reaction product was isolated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer and 0.1 g of ethidium bromide per ml. The DNA band was visualized with the aid of an Eagle Eye Imaging System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) at 360 nm. The 3.9 kb DNA band was excised from the gel and purified by using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The 3.9 kb fragment was self-ligated at 16C overnight with 10 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), 9  of the 3.9 kb PCR fragment, and 1  of 10X ligation buffer (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA). The ligation was heat inactivated for 10 minutes at 65C and then digested with Dpn I at 37C for 2 hours. After incubation, the digestion was purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit.      The purified material was then transformed into E. coli TOP10 competent cells     (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformation mixture was plated onto LB plates supplemented with 25 g of chloramphenicol per ml. Plasmid minipreps were prepared from several transformants and digested with Bgl II. One plasmid with the correct construction was chosen. The plasmid was designated pSigA4. Plasmid pSigA4 contains the Bgl II flanked transposon SigA2 identical to that disclosed in WO 01/77315.      A 60  sample of plasmid pSigA4 DNA (0.3 9/) was digested with Bgl II and separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer. A SigA2 transposon DNA band of 2 kb was eluted with 200  of EB buffer (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany) and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 200  of EB buffer. SigA2 was used for transposon assisted signal trapping.      A complete description of transposon assisted signal trapping can be found in WO 01/77315. A cDNA plasmid pool was prepared from 30,000 total transformants of the original cDNA-pMHas5 vector ligation. Plasmid DNA was prepared directly from a pool of colonies recovered from solid LB selective medium using a QIAPREP Spin Midi/Maxiprep Kit. The plasmid pool was treated with transposon SigA2 and MuA transposase (Finnzymes OY, Espoo, Finland) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      For in vitro transposon tagging of the Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 cDNA library, 4 or 8  of SigA2 transposon containing approximately 2.6 g of DNA were mixed with 1  of the plasmid DNA pool of the Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 cDNA library containing 2 g of DNA, 2  of MuA transposase (0.22 g/l), and 5  of 5X buffer (Finnzymes OY, Espoo, Finland) in a total volume of 50  and incubated at 30C for 3.5 hours followed by heat inactivation at 75C for 10 minutes. The DNA was precipitated by addition of 5  of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5 and 1 10  of 96% ethanol and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 10,000 x g. The pellet was washed in 70% ethanol, air dried at room temperature, and resuspended in 10  of 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA (TE) buffer.      A 1.5  volume of the transposon tagged plasmid pool was electroporated into 20  of E. coli DH10B ultracompetent cells (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a GENE PULSER and Pulse Controller (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) at 50 uF, 25 mAmp, 1 .8 kV with a 2 mm gap cuvette according to the manufacturer's procedure. The electroporated cells were incubated in SOC medium with shaking at 250 rpm for 2 hours at 28C before being plated on the following selective media: LB medium supplemented with 50 g of kanamycin per ml; LB medium supplemented with 50 g of kanamycin per ml and 15 g of chloramphencol per ml; and/or LB medium supplemented with 50 g of kanamycin per ml, 15 g of chloramphencol per ml, and 12.5 g of ampicillin per ml.      From dilution plating of the electroporation onto LB medium supplemented with kanamycin and chloramphencol medium, it was determined that approximately 72,000 colonies were present containing a cDNA library plasmid with a SigA2 transposition per electroporation and that approximately 69 colonies were recovered under triple selection (LB, kanamycin, chorlamphenicol, ampicillin). Further electroporation and plating experiments were performed until 445 total colonies were recovered under triple selection. The colonies were miniprepped using a QIAPREP 96 Turbo Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany). Plasmids were sequenced with the transposon forward and reverse primers (primers A and B), shown below, according to the procedure disclosed in WO 2001/77315 (page 28)      Primer A:      5'-AGCGTTTGCGGCCGCGATCC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 97)      Primer B:      5'-TTATTCGGTCGAAAAGGATCC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 98)      The Trichophaea saccata Family GH6 cDNA encoding cellobiohydrolase was subcloned into the Aspergillus expression vector pMStr57 (WO 2004/032648) by PCR amplifying the protein coding sequence from the cDNA library SBL0521 , described above, with the two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below.      Primer 848:      5'-ACACAACTGGGGATCCTCATCATGAAGAACTTCCTTCTGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 99) Primer 849:      5'-CCCTCTAGATCTCGAGTTACGTGAAGCTAGGATTAGCATT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 100)      The amplification was performed using I PROOF High Fidelity 2X Master Mix (Bio- Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The amplification reaction was composed of SBL0521 pool DNA as template, 25 pmol each of primers 848 and 849, and 25  of IPROOF High Fidelity 2X Master Mix in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed by pre-denaturing at 98C for 2 minutes; 5 cycles each with denaturing at 98C for 10 seconds, annealing at 65C for 10 seconds, and elongation at 72C for 1 minute; and 25 cycles each with denaturing at 98C for 10 seconds, and combined annealing extension at 72C for 1 minute. A final elongation was made at 72C for 10 minutes.      A PCR product of 1 .4 kb was separated from residual reaction components using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The PCR fragment was cloned into Bam HI and Xho I digested pMStr57 using an IN- FUSION Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). Approximately 50 ng of PCR product and 200 ng of vector in a total volume of 10  were added to the IN-FUSION Dry-Down pellet. The reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Trichophaea saccata Family GH6 cellobiohydrolase encoding DNA of the resulting Aspergillus expression construct, pMStr179, was sequenced and the sequence agreed completely with the cellobiohydrolase coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16.      The same PCR fragment was cloned into the pCR-Bluntll-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit, to generate pMStr199. The Trichophaea saccata Family GH6 cellobiohydrolase encoding DNA of pMStr199 was sequenced and the sequence agreed completely with the cellobiohydrolase coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. E. coli strain NN059165, containing pMStr199, was deposited with the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM), Braunschweig, Germany, on February 24, 2010 and assigned the accession number DSM 23379.      The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the Trichophaea saccata cellobiohydrolase cDNA are shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2, respectively. The coding sequence is 1344 bp including the stop codon. The encoded predicted protein is 447 amino acids. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1 -6), a signal peptide of 16 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 431 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 45.3 kDa and an isoelectric pH of 5.06.      A comparative pairwise global alignment of amino acid sequences was determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of EMBOSS with gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 matrix. The alignment showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the Trichophaea saccata cDNA encoding a Family GH6 polypeptide having cellobiohydrolase activity shares 64% identity (excluding gaps) to the deduced amino acid sequence of a cellobiohydrolase from Aspergillus fumigatus (GENESEQP:ABB80166).      The Aspergillus oryzae strain BECh2 (WO 2000/39322) was transformed with pMStr179 according to Christensen et al., 1988, Biotechnology 6, 1419-1422 and WO 2004/032648. Ten transformants were cultured for 4 days at 30C in 750  of DAP2C-1 medium (WO 2004/032648), in which 2% glucose was substituted for maltodextrin. Samples were monitored by SDS-PAGE using a CRITERION XT Precast 12% Bis-Tris gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. LMW standards from an Amersham Low Molecular Weight Calibration Kit for SDS Electrophoresis (GE Healthcare UK Limited, Buckinghamshire, UK) were used as molecular weight markers. The gel was stained with INSTANTBLUE (Expedeon Protein Solutions, Cambridge, UK). Eight transformants produced a novel protein doublet in the range of 55-60 kDa.      Two of these transformants, designated Aspergillus oryzae MStr335 and MStr336, were isolated twice by dilution streaking conidia on selective medium (amdS) containing 0.01 % TRITON X-100 to limit colony size.      Spores from four confluent COVE N slants of Aspergillus oryzae MStr335 spores were collected with a solution of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and used to inoculate 21 shake flasks each containing 150 ml of DAP2C-1 medium (WO 2004/032648) in which 2% glucose was substituted for maltodextrin. The flasks were incubated at 30C with constant shaking at 200 rpm for 3 days. Fungal mycelia and spores were removed at harvesting by first filtering the fermentation broth through a sandwich of 3 glass microfiber filters with increasing particle retention sizes of 1 .6 , 1 .2  and 0.7 , and then filtering through a 0.45  filter. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 9: Preparation of Aspergillus fumigatus cellobiohydrolase II      Aspergillus fumigatus NN055679 cellobiohydrolase II (CBHII) (SEQ ID NO: 17 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 18 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was prepared according to the following procedure.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to PCR amplify the full-length open reading frame of the Aspergillus fumigatus Family 6A glycosyl hydrolase from genomic DNA. A TOPO Cloning kit was used to clone the PCR product. An INFUSION Cloning Kit was used to clone the fragment into pAILo2.      Forward primer:      5'-ACTGGATTTACCATGAAGCACCTTGCATCTTCCATCG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 101 )      Reverse primer:      5'-TCACCTCTAGTTAATTAAAAGGACGGGTTAGCGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 102)      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence contains sequence identity compared with the insertion sites of pAILo2.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing 500 ng of Aspergillus fumigatus genomic DNA, 1X ThermoPol Taq reaction buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), 6  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 0.1 unit of Taq DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), in a final volume of 50 . An EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 was used to amplify the fragment programmed for one cycle at 98C for 2 minutes; and 35 cycles each at 96C for 30 seconds, 61 C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes. After the 35 cycles, the reaction was incubated at 72C for 10 minutes and then cooled at 10C until further processed. To remove the A-tails produced by Taq the reaction was incubated for 10 minutes at 68C in the presence of 1 unit of Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).      A 1 .3 kb PCR reaction product was isolated on a 0.8% GTG-agarose gel (Cambrex Bioproducts, East Rutherford, NJ, USA) using TAE buffer and 0.1 g of ethidium bromide per ml. The DNA band was visualized with the aid of a DARK READER (Clare Chemical Research, Dolores, CO) to avoid UV-induced mutations. The 1 .3 kb DNA band was excised with a disposable razor blade and purified with an Ultrafree-DA spin cup (Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The purified 1.3 kb PCR product was cloned into the PCR4Blunt-TOPO vector     (Invitrogen). Two microliters of the purified PCR product were mixed with one microliter of a 2M Sodium chloride solution and one microliter of the Topo vector. The reaction was incubated at room temperarature for 15 minutes and then two microliters of the Topo reaction were used to transform E. coli TOP 10 competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two aliquots of 100 microliters each of the transformation reaction were spreaded onto two 150 mm 2xYT-Amp plates and incubated overnight at 37C.      Eight recombinant colonies were used to inoculate liquid cultures containing three milliliters of LB supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per milliliter of media. Plasmid DNA was prepared from these cultures using a BIOROBOT 9600. Clones were analyzed by restriction digest. Plasmid DNA from each clone was digested with the enzyme Eco Rl according to the manufacturer instructions (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as above. Six out of eight clones had the expected restriction digest pattern from these, clones 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were selected to be sequenced to confirm that there were no mutations in the cloned insert. Sequence analysis of their 5-prime and 3-prime ends indicated that clones 2, 6 and 7 had the correct sequence. These three clones were selected for re-cloning into pAILo2. One microliter aliquot of each clone was mixed with 17  of diluted TE (1 :10 dilution) and 1  of this mix was used to re-amplify the Aspergillus fumigatus glycosyl hydrolase 6A coding region.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing     1  of the diluted mix of clones 2, 6 and 7, 1X Pfx Amplification Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 6  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 2.5 units of PLATINUM Pfx DNA Polymerase, 1  of 50 mM MgS04, in a final volume of 50 . An EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 was used to amplify the fragment programmed for one cycle at 98C for 2 minutes; and 35 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 61 C for 30 seconds, and 68C for 1.5 minutes. After the 35 cycles, the reaction was incubated at 68C for 10 minutes and then cooled at 10C until further processed. A 1.3 kb PCR reaction product was isolated on a 0.8% GTG-agarose gel using TAE buffer and 0.1 g of ethidium bromide per ml. The DNA band was visualized with the aid of a DARKREADER Transilluminator to avoid UV- induced mutations. The 1 .0 kb DNA band was excised with a disposable razor blade and purified with an Ultrafree-DA spin cup (Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The vector pAILo2 was linearized by digestion with Nco I and Pac I (using conditions specified by the manufacturer). The fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and ultrafiltration as described above. Cloning of the purified PCR fragment into the linearized and purified pAILo2 vector was performed with an IN-FUSION Cloning Kit. The reaction (20 ) contained 1 X IN-FUSION Buffer, 1X BSA, 1  of IN-FUSION enzyme (diluted 1 :10), 100 ng of pAILo2 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 50 ng of the Aspergillus fumigatus GH6A purified PCR product. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. A 2  sample of the reaction was used to transform transform E. coli TOP10 competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the recovery period, two 100  aliquots from the transformation reaction were plated onto 150 mm 2X YT plates supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. The plates were incubated overnight at 37C. A set of eight putative recombinant clones was selected at random from the selection plates and plasmid DNA was prepared from each one using a BIOROBOT 9600. Clones were analyzed by Pst I restriction digest. Seven out of eight clones had the expected restriction digest pattern. Clones 1 . 2 and 3 were then sequenced to confirm that there were no mutations in the cloned insert. Clone #2 was selected and designated pAILo33.      Aspergillus fumigatus cel6A (Jal_355 ALL033 Exp03191 ) was grown to obtain culture broth for the purification of a cellobiosehydrolase II.      Seven hundred and fifty ml of shake flask medium were added to a 2800 ml shake flask. The shake flask medium was composed per liter of 45 g of maltose, 2 g of K2HP04, 12 g of KH2P04, 1 g of NaCI, 1 g of MgS04-7H20, 7 g of yeast extract, 2 g of urea, and 0.5 ml of trace elements solution. The trace elements solution was composed per liter of 13.8 g of FeS04-7H20, 14.3 g of ZnS04-7H20, 8.5 g of MnS04-H20, 2.5 g of CuS04-5H20, 0.5 g of NiCI2-6H20, and 3 g of citric acid. Two shake flasks were inoculated by suspension of a PDA plate of Aspergillus fumigatus cel6A with 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and incubated at 34C on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm for 120 hours.      The broth was filtered using 0.7  glass filter GF/F (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and then using a 0.22  EXPRESS Plus Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).      The filtered broth was concentrated and buffer exchanged using a tangential flow concentrator (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA, USA) equipped with a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA, USA) with 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Example 10: Preparation of Aspergillus terreus ATCC 28865 Cel7 endoglucanase I     The Aspergillus terreus ATCC 28865 Cel7 endoglucanase I gene (SEQ ID NO: 19 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 20 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was cloned and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae as described below.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to PCR amplify the endoglucanase I gene from Aspergillus terreus ATCC 28865 genomic DNA. Genomic DNA was isolated using a FASTDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). Primer #226:      5'-TAACAATTGTCACCATGAATTCTCTTACAAAAAGCAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 103)      Primer #227:      5'-TATGCGGCCGCAGTCTGCATGTGTTACGCACCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 104)      The amplification reaction was composed of 1  of Aspergillus terreus ATCC 28865 genomic DNA, 12.5  of 2X REDDYMIX PCR Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,     Waltham, MA, USA), 1  of primer #226 (5 ), 1  of #227 (5 ), and 9.5  of H20. The amplification reaction was incubated in a PTC-200 DNA ENGINE Thermal Cycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) programmed for 1 cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; and 35 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds and 60C for 1.5 minutes.      A 1 .44 kb PCR reaction product was isolated by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer and staining with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad,     CA, USA). The DNA band was visualized with the aid of an EAGLE EYE Imaging System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and a DARKREADER Transilluminator. The 1.44 kb DNA band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band     Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The 1 .44 kb fragment was cleaved with Mfe I and Not I and purified using a GFX     PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The cleaved 1.44 kb fragment was then directionally cloned by ligation into Eco Rl-     /ot I cleaved pXYG1051 (WO 2005/080559) using T4 ligase (Promega, Madison, Wl, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ligation mixture was transformed into . coli TOP10F competent cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformation mixture was plated onto LB plates supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. Plasmid minipreps were prepared from several transformants and sequenced. One plasmid with the correct Aspergillus terreus GH7 coding sequence (SEQ ID NO: 13) was chosen. The plasmid was designated pXYG1051- NP003857. The expression vector pXYG1051 contains the same neutral amylase II (NA2) promoter derived from Aspergillus niger, and terminator elements as pCaHj483 (disclosed in Example 4 of WO 98/00529). Furthermore pXYG1051 has pUC18 derived sequences for selection and propagation in E. coli, and pDSY82 (disclosed in Example 4 of U.S. Patent No. 5,958,727) derived sequences for selection and expression in Aspergillus facilitated by the pyrG gene of Aspergillus oryzae, which encodes orotidine decarboxylase and is used to complement a pyrG mutant Aspergillus strain.      The expression plasmid pXYG1051-NP003857 was transformed into Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355 as described in WO 98/00529. Transformants were purified on selection plates through single conidia prior to sporulating them on PDA plates. Production of the Aspergillus terreus GH7 polypeptide by the transformants was analyzed from culture supernatants of 1 ml 96 deep well stationary cultivations at 26C in YP medium with 2% maltodextrin. Expression was verified by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) by Coomassie blue staining. One transformant was selected for further work and designated Aspergillus oryzae 28.4.      For larger scale production, Aspergillus oryzae 28.4 spores were spread onto a PDA plate and incubated for five days at 37C. The confluent spore plate was washed twice with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 to maximize the number of spores collected. The spore suspension was then used to inoculate twenty-five 500 ml flasks containing 100 ml of YPM medium. The culture was incubated at 30C with constant shaking at 85 rpm. At day four post-inoculation, the culture broth was collected by filtration through a triple layer of glass microfiber filters of 1.6 , 1.2 , and 0.7  (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Fresh culture broth from this transformant produced a band of GH7 protein of approximately 64 kDa. The identity of this band as the Aspergillus terreus GH7 polypeptide was verified by peptide sequencing using standard techniques.      Two liters of the filtered broth was concentrated to 400 ml and washed with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0 using a SARTOFLOW Alpha Plus Crossflow System with a 10 kDa cut-off (Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A., Aubagne Cedex, France). Ammonium sulphate was added to a final concentration of 1 M and dissolved in the ultrafiltrate. The solution was loaded onto a Source 15 Phenyl XK 26/20 50 ml column (GE Healthcare, Hillerad, Denmark). After loading the column was washed with 150 ml of 1 M ammonium sulphate and eluted with 1 column volume of 50% ethanol in a 0% to 100% gradient followed by 5 column volumes of 50% ethanol at a flow rate of 10 ml per minute. Fractions of 10 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions 3 to 8 were pooled and diluted to 1000 ml with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0 before loading onto a Q SEPHAROSE Fast Flow XK26/20 60 ml column (GE Healthcare, Hillerad, Denmark). After loading the column was washed 3 times with 60 ml of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0 and eluded with 100 ml of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 1 M NaCI at a flow rate of 10 ml per minute. Fractions of 10 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS- PAGE. The flow through and first wash were pooled and concentrated to 400 ml and washed with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0 using a SARTOFLOW Alpha plus Crossflow System with a 10 kDa cut-off. Further concentration was conducted using a VIVASPIN centrifugal concentrator according to the manufacturer's instructions to a final volume of 80 ml. The protein concentration was determined by A28o A26o absorbance. Example 11 : Preparation of Trichoderma reesei RutC30 Cel5A endoglucanase II      The Trichoderma reesei RutC30 Cel5A endoglucanase II gene (SEQ ID NO: 21 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 22 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was cloned and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae as described below.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to PCR amplify the endoglucanase II gene from Trichoderma reesei RutC30 genomic DNA. Genomic DNA was isolated using a DNEASY Plant Maxi Kit. An IN-FUSION PCR Cloning Kit was used to clone the fragment directly into pAILo2 (WO 2004/099228).      Forward primer:      5'-ACTGGATTTACCATGAACAAGTCCGTGGCTCCATTGCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 105)      Reverse primer:      5'-TCACCTCTAGTTAATTAACTACTTTCTTGCGAGACACG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 106)      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence contains sequence identity to insertion sites of pAILo2.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing 200 ng of Trichoderma reesei genomic DNA, 1X Pfx Amplification Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 6  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 2.5 units of PLATINUM Pfx DNA polymerase, and 1  of 50 mM MgS04 in a final volume of 50 . The amplification reaction was incubated in an EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 programmed for one cycle at 98C for 2 minutes; and 35 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 61 C for 30 seconds, and 68C for 1.5 minutes. After the 35 cycles, the reaction was incubated at 68C for 10 minutes and then cooled at 10C. A 1.5 kb PCR reaction product was isolated on a 0.8% GTG agarose gel using TAE buffer and 0.1 g of ethidium bromide per ml. The DNA band was visualized with the aid of a DARKREADER Transilluminator. The 1.5 kb DNA band was excised with a disposable razor blade and purified using an ULTRAFREE DA spin cup according to the manufacturer's instructions.      Plasmid pAILo2 was linearized by digestion with Nco I and Pac I. The plasmid fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and ultrafiltration as described above. Cloning of the purified PCR fragment into the linearized and purified pAILo2 vector was performed using an IN-FUSION PCR Cloning Kit. The reaction (20 ) contained 1 X IN-FUSION Buffer, 1X BSA, 1  of IN-FUSION enzyme (diluted 1 :10), 100 ng of pAILo2 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 100 ng of the Trichoderma reesei Cel5A endoglucanase II PCR product. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. A 2  sample of the reaction was used to transform E. coli XL10 SOLOPACK Gold cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a recovery period, two 100  aliquots from the transformation reaction were plated onto 150 mm 2X YT plates supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. The plates were incubated overnight at 37C. A set of 3 putative recombinant clones was recovered the selection plates and plasmid DNA was prepared from each one using a BIOROBOT 9600. Clones were analyzed by Pci \IBsp LU1 1 I restriction digestion. One clone with the expected restriction digestion pattern was then sequenced to confirm that there were no mutations in the cloned insert. Clone #3 was selected and designated pAILo27.      Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of     Christensen et al., 1988, supra. Five micrograms of pAILo27 (as well as pAILo2 as a control) were used to transform Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250 protoplasts.      The transformation of Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250 with pAILo27 yielded about 50 transformants. Eleven transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates and incubated for five days at 34C.      Confluent spore plates were washed with 3 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 80 and the spore suspension was used to inoculate 25 ml of MDU2BP medium in 125 ml glass shake flasks. Transformant cultures were incubated at 34C with constant shaking at 200 rpm. At day five post-inoculation, cultures were centrifuged at 6000 x g and their supernatants collected. Five microliters of each supernatant were mixed with an equal volume of 2X loading buffer (10% beta-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a 1.5 mm 8%-16% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel and stained with SIMPLYBLUE SafeStain (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). SDS-PAGE profiles of the culture broths showed that ten out of eleven transformants produced a new protein band of approximately 45 kDa. Transformant number 1 , designated Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250AILo27, was cultivated in a fermentor.      One hundred ml of shake flask medium were added to a 500 ml shake flask. The shake flask medium was composed per liter of 50 g of sucrose, 10 g of KH2P04, 0.5 g of CaCI2, 2 g of MgSCy7H20, 2 g of K2S04, 2 g of urea, 10 g of yeast extract, 2 g of citric acid, and 0.5 ml of trace metals solution.

The shake flask was inoculated with two plugs of Aspergillus oryzae JaL250AILo27 from a PDA plate and incubated at 34C on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm for 24 hours. Fifty ml of the shake flask broth was used to inoculate a 3 liter fermentation vessel.      A total of 1.8 liters of the fermentation batch medium was added to a three liter glass jacketed fermentor (Applikon Biotechnology, Schiedam, Netherlands). The fermentation batch medium was composed per liter of 10 g of yeast extract, 24 g of sucrose, 5 g of (NH4)2S04, 2 g of KH2P04, 0.5 g of CaCI2-2H20, 2 g of MgS04-7H20, 1 g of citric acid, 2 g of K2S04, 0.5 ml of anti-foam, and 0.5 ml of trace metals solution.

Fermentation feed medium was composed of maltose. Fermentation feed medium was dosed at a rate of 0 to 4.4 g/l/hr for a period of 185 hours. The fermentation vessel was maintained at a temperature of 34C and pH was controlled using an Applikon 1030 control system (Applikon Biotechnology, Schiedam, Netherlands) to a set-point of 6.1 +/- 0.1. Air was added to the vessel at a rate of 1 vvm and the broth was agitated by a Rushton impeller rotating at 1 100 to 1300 rpm. At the end of the fermentation, whole broth was harvested from the vessel and centrifuged at 3000 x g to remove the biomass. The supernatant was sterile filtered and stored at 5 to 10C.      The supernatant was desalted and buffer-exchanged in 20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0 using a HIPREP 26/10 desalting column according to the manufacturer's instructions. The buffer exchanged sample was loaded onto a MonoQ column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated with 20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, and the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1000 mM sodium chloride. Protein fractions were pooled and buffer exchanged into 1.2 M (NH4)2SO4-20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.5. The sample was loaded onto a Phenyl SUPEROSE column (HR 16/10) equilibrated with 1 .2 M (NH4)2SO4-20 mM Tris- HCI pH 8.0. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient over 20 column volumes from 1 .2 to 0 M (NH4)2S04 in 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.5. The fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a SUPERDEX 75 HR 26/60 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-150 mM sodium chloride pH 8.5. Fractions were pooled and concentrated in 20 mM Tris-150 mM sodium chloride pH 8.5.

A single clone harboring a plasmid named pBGC1009 containing the endoglucanase cDNA was isolated.      PCR primers were designed to amplify the cDNA encoding the T aurantiacus endoglucanase from plasmid pBGC1009. Restriction enzyme sites Bsp HI and Pac I were incorporated for in-frame cloning into Aspergillus oryzae expression plasmid pBM120a (WO 2006/039541 ).      Primer 996261 :      5'-GATCTCATGAAGCTCGGCTCTCTCGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 1 1 1 )      BspH\      Primer 996167:      5'-TTAATTAATCAAAGATACGGAGTCAAAATAGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 1 12)      Pad      The fragment of interest was amplified by PCR using an EXPAND High Fidelity PCR System. The PCR amplification reaction mixture contained 1  of 0.09 9/ pBGC1009, 1  of primer 996261 (50 pmol/), 1  of primer 996167 (50 pmol/), 5  of 10X PCR buffer with 15 mM MgCI2, 1  of dNTP mix (10 mM each), 37.25  of water, and 0.75  (3.5 U/) of DNA polymerase mix. An EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER thermocycler was used to amplify the fragment programmed for 1 cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; 10 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 55C for 30 seconds, 72C for 1 .5 minutes; 15 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 55C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 1 .5 minutes plus 5 second elongation at each successive cycle; 1 cycle at 72C for 7 minutes; and a 4C hold.      The 1008 bp PCR product was purified by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer, excised from the gel, and purified using a QIAQUICK Gel Purification Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The purified product was ligated directly into pCR2.1-TOPO according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting plasmid was named pBM124a.      Plasmid pBM124a was digested with Bsp HI and Pac I, purified by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer, excised from the gel, and purified using a QIAQUICK Gel Purification Kit. The plasmid fragment was ligated to the vector pBM120a, which was digested with Nco I and Pac I. The resulting expression plasmid was designated pBM123a. Plasmid pBM123a contains a duplicate NA2-TPI promoter driving expression of the Thermoascus aurantiacus endoglucanase cDNA clone, the AMG terminator, and amdS as a selectable marker.      Aspergillus oryzae BECh2 (WO 2000/139322) protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, supra. Six g of pBM123a were used to transform Aspergillus oryzae BECh2. Primary transformants were selected on COVE plates for 5 days. Transformants were spore purified twice prior to shake flask analysis.      Spores of the transformants were inoculated into 25 ml of MY25 medium in 125 ml shake flasks. The cultures were incubated at 34C, 200 rpm on a platform shaker for five days. On day 3 and day 5, culture supernatants were harvested and clarified by centrifugation to remove mycelia. Twenty microliters of supernatant from three transformants were analyzed using a CRITERION stain-free, 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS- PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that all transformants had a new major band of approximately 32 kDa. One transformant was chosen and named EXP00858.      Plastic, non-baffled 500 ml shake flasks containing 100 ml of SY50 medium were inoculated with 0.1 ml of a spore stock of EXP00858, and incubated at 34C, 200 rpm for 24 hours to produce a seed culture. Fifty ml of the seed culture was inoculated into a 2 liter fermentation tank containing 2 liters of medium composed per liter of 0.5 g of pluronic acid, 30 g of sucrose, 2 g of MgS04-7H20, 2 g of anhydrous KH2P04, 1 g of citric acid-, 2 g of (NH4)2S04, 1 g of K2S04, 20 g of yeast extract, and 0.5 g of 200X AMG trace metals solution, pH 5.0. The fermentation was fed with a maltose feed. The pH was controlled using 5N H3P04 and 15% NH4OH and maintained at 5.0 and then raised to 5.25. Temperature was maintained 34.0 C +/- 1.0 C. Agitation was 1000 rpm. Airflow was 1.0 vvm.      A 200 ml volume of cell-free supernatant was diluted to 1 liter with deionized water. The pH was adjusted to 8 and the sample filter sterilized using a 0.22  polyethersulphone (PES) filter. The filter sterilized sample was loaded onto a 250 ml Q SEPHAROSE Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) pre-equilibrated with 25 mM Tris pH 8. The enzyme was eluted from the column with a 0 to 1 M NaOH gradient in the same buffer. The fractions containing beta-glucosidase activity were pooled (400 ml) and the enzyme concentration calculated from the theoretic extinction coefficient and the absorbance of the sample at 280 nm.      Example 14: Preparation of Aspergillus fumigatus NN055679 Cel3A beta-glucosidase     Aspergillus fumigatus NN055679 Cel3A beta-glucosidase (SEQ ID NO: 27 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 28 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was recombinantly prepared according to WO 2005/047499 using Trichoderma reesei RutC30 as a host.

The sample was loaded onto a Q SEPHAROSE High Performance column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris pH 8.5, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0-600 mM sodium chloride. The fractions were concentrated and loaded onto a SUPERDEX 75 HR 26/60 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-150 mM sodium chloride pH 8.5. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 15: Preparation of Penicillium brasilianum IBT 20888 Cel3A beta-glucosidase     Penicillium brasilianum IBT 20888 Cel3A beta-glucosidase (SEQ ID NO: 29 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 30 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was recombinantly prepared according to WO 2007/019442 using Aspergillus oryzae as a host.      Filtered broth was concentrated and buffer exchanged using a tangential flow concentrator equipped with a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane with 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0.

The fractions were concentrated into 20 mM Tris pH 8.0. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 16: Preparation of Aspergillus niger IBT 10140 Cel3 beta-glucosidase      The Aspergillus niger IBT 10140 Cel3 beta-glucosidase gene (SEQ ID NO: 31 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 32 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was isolated by PCR using two cloning primers GH3-9.1f and GH3-9.1 r shown below, which were designed based on the publicly available Aspergillus niger Cel3 sequence (CAK48740.1 ) for direct cloning using an IN-FUSION Cloning Kit.      Primer GH3-9.1f:      acacaactggggatccaccatgaggttcacttcgatcgagg (SEQ ID NO: 1 13)      Primer GH3-9.1 r:      agatctcgagaagcttaGTGAACAGTAGGCAGAGACGCCCG (SEQ ID NO: 1 14)      A PCR reaction was performed with genomic DNA prepared from Aspergillus niger strain NN005810 in order to amplify the full-length gene. The genomic DNA was isolated using a FASTDNA Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA). The PCR reaction was composed of 1  of genomic DNA, 0.75  of primer GH3-9.1f (10 ), 0.75  of primer GH3-9.1 r (10 ), 3  of 5X HF buffer (Finnzymes Oy, Finland), 0.25  of 50 mM MgCI2, 0.3  of 10 mM dNTP, 0.15  of PHUSION DNA polymerase (Finnzymes Oy, Finland), and PCR-grade water up to 15 . The PCR reaction was performed using a DYAD PCR machine (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) programmed for 2 minutes at 98C followed by 10 touchdown cycles at 98C for 15 seconds, 70C (-1 C/cycle) for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds; and 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 60C for 30 seconds, 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds; and 5 minutes at 72C.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where an approximately 2.6 kb PCR product band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. DNA corresponding to the A. niger Cel3 beta-glucosidase gene was cloned into the expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005/042735) linearized with Bam HI and Hind III, using an IN-FUSION Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      A 2.5  volume of the diluted ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli TOP10 chemically competent cells. Three colonies were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 g of ampicillin per ml and cultivated overnight in 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. Plasmid DNA was purified using an E.Z.N.A.<> Plasmid Mini Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc., Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The A. niger Cel3 beta-glucosidase gene sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing before heterologous expression.      Protoplasts of Aspergillus oryzae BECh2 (WO 2000/39322) were prepared as described in WO 95/02043. One hundred microliters of protoplast suspension were mixed with 2.5-15 g of the Aspergillus expression vector and 250  I of 10 mM CaCI2-10 mM Tris- HCI pH 7.5-60% PEG 4000 (PEG 4000; Applichem, Omaha, NE, USA) (polyethylene glycol, molecular weight 4,000) were added and gently mixed. The mixture was incubated at 37C for 30 minutes and the protoplasts were spread on COVE plates for transformant selection. After incubation for 4-7 days at 37C, spores of sixteen transformants were picked up and inoculated into YPM medium. After 4 days cultivation at 30C culture broth was analyzed in order to identified the best transformants based on their ability to produce A. niger Cel3 beta- glucosidase. The screening was based on intensity of the band corresponding to the heterologous expressed protein determined by SDS-PAGE and activity of the enzyme on 4- nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) using an assay was modified from Hagerdal et al., 1979, Biotechnology and Bioengineering 21 : 345-355: 10  I of culture broth was mixed with 90  of assay reagent containing 10  of 0.1 % TWEEN, 10  of 1 M sodium citrate pH 5, 4  of 100 mM pNPG substrate (Sigma Aldrich) solubilized in DMSO (0.4% final volume in stock solution), and filtered water. The assay was incubated for 30 minutes at 37C and the absorbance was analyzed at 405 nm before and after addition of 100  of 1 M sodium carbonate pH 10. The highest absorbance values at 405 nm were correlated to the SDS-PAGE data for selection of the best transformant.      Spores of the best transformant were spread on COVE plates containing 0.01 % TRITON X-100 in order to isolate single colonies. The spreading was repeated twice in total on COVE sucrose medium (Cove, 1996, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 133: 51 -56) containing 1 M sucrose and 10 mM sodium nitrate, supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCI. Fermentation was then performed in 250 ml shake flasks using YP medium containing 2% maltodextrin for 4 days at 30C with shaking at 100 rpm.      A 2 liter volume of culture supernatant (EXP02895) was filtered with a 0.7  glass fiber filter and then sterile filtered using a 0.22  PES membrane (Nalgene Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY, USA). The filtered supernatant was concentrated and diafiltered using cross-flow Sartocon Slice Cassettes (non Cellulose) with 10 kDa cut-off (Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A., Aubagne Cedex, France). The final volume was adjusted to 500 ml and pH adjusted to 4.5 by slowly adding dilute 10% acetic acid. The final ionic strength was under 4 MSi.      A 50 ml XK26 column (GE Healthcare, Hiller0d, Denmark) was packed with     Xpressline ProA (UpFront Chromatography A S, Copenhagen, Denmark) equilibrated with 50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 buffer. The filtered supernatant was loaded onto the column using a P500 Pump (GE Health Care, Hiller0d, Denmark) at a flow of 45 ml per minute and washed with 50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 buffer until all unbound material was eluted. The bound protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris pH 8 buffer using an AKTAexplorer System (GE Healthcare, Hiller0d, Denmark). Fractions were collected and monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The eluted protein were pooled and adjusted to pH 7 by slowly adding 0.5 M Tris base with a final ionic strength under 4 MSi.      A 50 ml Q SEPHAROSE Fast Flow column was equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES pH 7 buffer (buffer A). The column was then washed to remove unbound material by washing with 50 mM HEPES pH 7 buffer until the UV absorbance of the wash was below 0.05 at 280 nm. The bound protein was eluted using a linear salt gradient of 0 to 1 M NaCI in 50 mM HEPES pH 7 buffer as buffer B (10 column volume) using an AKTAexplorer System. Purity of protein fractions was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis using a 4-20% Tris- Glycine Gel (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Staining after electrophoresis was performed using INSTANT BLUE (Expedeon Ltd., Cambridgeshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions showing expected protein bands were pooled. Identification of the protein was determined by MS- Edman degradation using standard methods.      Example 17: Preparation of Thermoascus aurantiacus CGMCC 0583 GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity      Thermoascus aurantiacus CGMCC 0583 GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity (SEQ ID NO: 33 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 34 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was recombinantly prepared according to WO 2005/074656 using Aspergillus oryzae JaL250 as a host. The recombinantly produced Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide was first concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 10 kDa membrane, buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0, and then purified using a 100 ml Q SEPHAROSE Big Beads column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) with 600 ml of a 0-600 mM NaCI linear gradient in the same buffer. Fractions of 10 ml were collected and pooled based on SDS-PAGE.      The pooled fractions (90 ml) were then further purified using a 20 ml MONO Q column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) with 500 ml of a 0-500 mM NaCI linear gradient in the same buffer. Fractions of 6 ml were collected and pooled based on SDS- PAGE. The pooled fractions (24 ml) were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 10 kDa membrane, and chromatographed using a 320 ml SUPERDEX 75 SEC column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) with isocratic elution of approximately 1 .3 liters of 150 mM NaCI-20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0. Fractions of 20 ml were collected and pooled based on SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Example 18: Preparation of Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity      Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity (SEQ I D NO: 35 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 36 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was recombinantly prepared according to U.S. Patent No. 7,361 ,495 using Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250 as a host.      Filtered culture broth was desalted and buffer-exchanged into 20 mM sodium acetate-150 mM NaCI pH 5.0 using a HIPREP 26/10 Desalting Column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 19: Preparation of Aspergillus fumigatus NN051616 GH61 B polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity      A tblastn search (Altschul et ai, 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402) of the Aspergillus fumigatus partial genome sequence (The Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD) was performed using as query several known GH61 proteins including GH61A from Thermoascus aurantiacus (GeneSeqP Accession Number AEC05922). Several genes were identified as putative Family GH61 homologs based upon a high degree of similarity to the query sequences at the amino acid level. One genomic region of approximately 850 bp with greater than 70% identity to the Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61 A sequence at the amino acid level was chosen for further study.      Aspergillus fumigatus NN051616 was grown and harvested as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,244,605. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder and genomic DNA was isolated using a DNEASY Plant Kit according to manufacturer's instructions.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below were designed to PCR amplify the Aspergillus fumigatus Family GH61 B protein gene from the genomic DNA. An INFUSION Cloning Kit was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pAILo2, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      Forward primer:      5'-ACTGGATTTACCATGACTTTGTCCAAGATCACTTCCA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 1 15)      Reverse primer:      5'-TCACCTCTAGTTAATTAAGCGTTGAACAGTGCAGGACCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 1 16)     Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pAILo2.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing 204 ng of Aspergillus fumigatus genomic DNA, 1X Pfx Amplification Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1.5  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 2.5 units of PLATINUM Pfx DNA Polymerase, and 1  of 50 mM MgS04 in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed using an EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 epgradient S (Eppendorf Scientific, Inc., Westbury, NY, USA) programmed for one cycle at 94C for 3 minutes; and 30 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 56C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 1 minutes. The heat block was then held at 72C for 15 minutes followed by a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where an approximately 850 bp product band was excised from the gel and purified using a MINELUTE Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The fragment was then cloned into pAILo2 using an IN-FUSION Cloning Kit. The vector was digested with Nco I and Pac I. The fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis as above and a QIAQUICK Gel Purification Kit. The gene fragment and the digested vector were combined together in a reaction resulting in the expression plasmid pAG43 in which transcription of the Family GH61 B protein gene was under the control of the NA2-tpi promoter. The recombination reaction (20 ) was composed of 1X IN-FUSION Buffer, 1X BSA, 1  of IN-FUSION enzyme (diluted 1 :10), 166 ng of pAILo2 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 1 10 ng of the Aspergillus fumigatus GH61 B protein purified PCR product. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes followed by 15 minutes at 50C. The reaction was diluted with 40  of 10 mM Tris-0.1 M EDTA buffer and 2.5  of the diluted reaction was used to transform  coli SOLOPACK Gold cells. An . coli transformant containing pAG43 (GH61 B protein gene) was identified by restriction enzyme digestion and plasmid DNA was prepared using a BIOROBOT 9600.      DNA sequencing of the 862 bp PCR fragment was performed with a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Model 377 XL Automated DNA Sequencer using dye-terminator chemistry (Giesecke et al., 1992, supra) and primer walking strategy. The following vector specific primers were used for sequencing: pAllo2 5 Seq:      5' TGTCCCTTGTCGATGCG 3' (SEQ ID NO: 1 17)      pAllo2 3 Seq:      5' CACATGACTTGGCTTCC 3' (SEQ ID NO: 1 18)      Nucleotide sequence data were scrutinized for quality and all sequences were compared to each other with assistance of PHRED/PHRAP software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA).      A gene model for the Aspergillus fumigatus sequence was constructed based on similarity of the encoded protein to the Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A protein (GeneSeqP Accession Number AEC05922). The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence, are shown in SEQ ID NO: 37 and SEQ ID NO: 38, respectively. The genomic fragment encodes a polypeptide of 250 amino acids, interrupted by 2 introns of 53 and 56 bp. The% G+C content of the gene and the mature coding sequence are 53.9% and 57%, respectively. Using the SignalP software program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 21 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 221 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 23.39 kDa.      Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, supra. Six g of pAG43 were used to transform Aspergillus oryzae JaL355. Twenty-six transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates.      Confluent PDA plates of 24 transformants were each washed with 5 ml of 0.01 %     TWEEN 20 and the spores were each collected. Eight  of each spore stock was added to 1 ml of YPG, YPM, and M410 media separately in 24 well plates and incubated at 34C. After 3 days of incubation, 7.5  of supernatant from four transformants were analyzed using a CRITERION stain-free, 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE gel according to the manufacturer's instructions. Based on this gel, M410 was chosen as the best medium. Five days after incubation, 7.5  of supernatant from each M410 culture was analyzed using a CRITERION stain-free, 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that several transformants had a new major band of approximately 25 kDa.      A confluent plate of one transformant (grown on PDA) was washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and inoculated into four 500 ml Erienmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of M410 medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The flasks were harvested on day 5 (300 ml), filtered using a 0.22  EXPRESS Plus Membrane, and stored at 4C.      The filtered shake flask broth containing Aspergillus fumigatus GH61 B polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity was concentrated using a 10 kDa MWCO Amicon Ultra centrifuge concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) to approximately 10-fold smaller volume. The concentrated filtrate was buffer-exchanged and desalted using a BIO-GEL P6 desalting column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) pre-equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), pH 8.0, according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following exception: 3 ml of sample was loaded and eluted with 3 ml of buffer. Concentrated, desalted GH61 B protein was quantified using a BCA protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a protein concentration standard. Quantification was performed in triplicate. Enzyme purity was confirmed using 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE at 200 volts for 1 hour and staining with BIO-SAFE Coomassie Stain. Example 20: Preparation of Penicillium pinophilum GH61 polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity      Penicillium pinophilum GH61 polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity SEQ ID NO: 39 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 40 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was preaped according to the procedure described below.      Compost samples were collected from Yunnan, China on December 12, 2000.     Penicillium pinophilum NN046877 was isolated using single spore isolation techniques on PDA plates at 45C. Penicillium pinophilum strain NN046877 was inoculated onto a PDA plate and incubated for 4 days at 37C in the darkness. Several mycelia-PDA plugs were inoculated into 500 ml shake flasks containing 100 ml of NNCYP-PCS medium. The flasks were incubated for 5 days at 37C with shaking at 160 rpm. The mycelia were collected at day 4 and day 5. The mycelia from each day were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a - 80C freezer until use.      The frozen mycelia were transferred into a liquid nitrogen prechilled mortar and pestle and ground to a fine powder. Total RNA was prepared from the powdered mycelia of each day by extraction with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The polyA enriched RNA was isolated using a mTRAP Total Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA).      Double stranded cDNA from each day was synthesized with a SMART cDNA library Construction Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). The cDNA was cleaved with Sfi I and the cDNA was size fractionated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer. The fraction of cDNA of 500 bp and larger was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then equal amounts of cDNA from day 4 and day 5 were pooled for library construction.      The pooled cDNA was then directionally cloned by ligation into Sfi I cleaved pMHas7     (WO 2009/037253) using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ligation mixture was electroporated into . coli ELECTROMAX DH10B cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a GENE PULSER and Pulse Controller (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) at 25 uF, 25 mAmp, 1 .8 kV with a 1 mm gap cuvette according to the manufacturer's procedure.      The electroporated cells were plated onto LB plates supplemented with 50 mg of kanamycin per liter. A cDNA plasmid pool was prepared from 60,000 total transformants of the original pMHas7 vector ligation. Plasmid DNA was prepared directly from the pool of colonies using a QIAGEN Plasmid Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).      A transposon containing plasmid designated pSigA4 was constructed from the pSigA2 transposon containing plasmid described WO 2001/77315 in order to create an improved version of the signal trapping transposon of pSigA2 with decreased selection background. The pSigA2 transposon contains a signal less beta-lactamase construct encoded on the transposon itself. PCR was used to create a deletion of the intact beta lactamase gene found on the plasmid backbone using a proofreading Pfu Turbo polymerase PROOFSTART (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany) and the following 5' phosphorylated primers (TAG Copenhagen, Denmark):      SigA2NotU-P:      5'-TCGCGATCCGTTTTCGCATTTATCGTGAAACGCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 1 19)      SigA2NotD-P:      5'-CCGCAAACGCTGGTGAAAGTAAAAGATGCTGAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 120)      The amplification reaction was composed of 1  of pSigA2 (10 ng/ ), 5  of 10X     PROOFSTART Buffer (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany), 2.5  of dNTP mix (20 mM), 0.5  of SigA2NotU-P (10 mM), 0.5  of SigA2NotD-P (10 mM), 10  of Q solution (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany), and 31.25  of deionized water. A DNA ENGINE Thermal Cycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was used for amplification programmed for one cycle at 95C for 5 minutes; and 20 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 62C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 4 minutes.      A 3.9 kb PCR reaction product was isolated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer and 0.1 g of ethidium bromide per ml. The DNA band was visualized with the aid of an EAGLE EYE Imaging System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) at 360 nm. The 3.9 kb DNA band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The 3.9 kb fragment was self-ligated at 16C overnight with 10 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), 9  of the 3.9 kb PCR fragment, and 1  of 10X ligation buffer (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA). The ligation was heat inactivated for 10 minutes at 65C and then digested with Dpn I at 37C for 2 hours. After incubation, the digestion was purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit. The purified material was then transformed into E. coli TOP10 competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformation mixture was plated onto LB plates supplemented with 25 g of chloramphenicol per ml. Plasmid minipreps were prepared from several transformants and digested with Bgl II. One plasmid with the correct construction was chosen. The plasmid was designated pSigA4. Plasmid pSigA4 contains the Bgl II flanked transposon SigA2 identical to that disclosed in WO 2001/77315.      A 60  sample of plasmid pSigA4 DNA (0.3 g l) was digested with Bgl II and separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer. A SigA2 transposon DNA band of 2 kb was eluted with 200  of EB buffer (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany) and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 200  of EB buffer. SigA2 was used for transposon assisted signal trapping.      A complete description of transposon assisted signal trapping is described in WO 2001/77315. The plasmid pool was treated with transposon SigA2 and HYPERMU transposase (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, Wl, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      For in vitro transposon tagging of the Penicillium pinophilum cDNA library, 2  of SigA2 transposon containing approximately 100 ng of DNA were mixed with 1  of the plasmid DNA pool of the Penicillium pinophilum cDNA library containing 1 g of DNA, 1  of HYPERMU transposase, and 2  of 10X buffer (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, Wl, USA) in a total volume of 20  and incubated at 30C for 3 hours followed by adding 2  of stop buffer (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, Wl, USA) and heat inactivation at 75C for 10 minutes. The DNA was precipitated by addition of 2  of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5 and 55  of 96% ethanol and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 10,000 x g, 4C. The pellet was washed in 70% ethanol, air dried at room temperature, and resuspended in 10  of deionized water.      A 2  volume of the transposon tagged plasmid pool was electroporated into 50  of E. coli ELECTROMAX DH10B cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a GENE PULSER and Pulse Controller at 25 uF, 25 mAmp, 1.8 kV with a 1 mm gap cuvette according to the manufacturer's procedure.      The electroporated cells were incubated in SOC medium with shaking at 225 rpm for 1 hour at 37C before being plated onto the following selective media: LB medium supplemented with 50 g of kanamycin per ml; LB medium supplemented with 50 g of kanamycin per ml and 15 g of chloramphencol per ml; and LB medium supplemented with 50 g of kanamycin per ml, 15 g of chloramphencol per ml, and 30 g of ampicillin per ml.      From plating of the electroporation onto LB medium supplemented with kanamycin, chloramphencol and ampicillin, approximately 200 colonies per 50  were observed after 3 days at 30C. All colonies were replica plated onto LB kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin medium described above. Five hundred colonies were recovered under this selection condition. The DNA from each colony was sequenced with the transposon forward and reverse primers (primers A and B), shown below, according to the procedure disclosed in WO 2001/77315 (page 28).      Primer A:      5'-agcgtttgcggccgcgatcc-3' (SEQ ID NO: 121 )      Primer B:      5'-ttattcggtcgaaaaggatcc-3' (SEQ ID NO: 122)      DNA sequences were obtained from SinoGenoMax Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). Primer     A and primer B sequence reads for each plasmid were trimmed to remove vector and transposon sequence. The assembled sequences were grouped into contigs by using the program PhredPhrap (Ewing et al., 1998, Genome Research 8: 175-185; Ewing and Green, 1998, Genome Research 8: 186-194). All contigs were subsequently compared to sequences available in standard public DNA and protein sequences databases (TrEMBL, SWALL, PDB, EnsemblPep, GeneSeqP) using the program BLASTX 2.0a19MP-WashU [14- Jul-1998] [Build Iinux-x86 18:51 :44 30-Jul-1998] (Gish et al., 1993, Nat. Genet. 3: 266-72). The family GH10 xylanase candidate was identified directly by analysis of the BlastX results.      Penicillium pinophilum NN046877 was grown on a PDA agar plate at 37C for 4-5 days. Mycelia were collected directly from the agar plate into a sterilized mortar and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder, and genomic DNA was isolated using a DNEASY Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).      Based on the Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase gene information obtained as described above, oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the GH61 gene from genomic DNA of Penicillium pinophilum GH10 NN046877. An IN-FUSION CF Dry-down Cloning Kit was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pPFJ0355, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      Sense primer:      5'-ACACAACTGGGGATCCACCATGACTCTAGTAAAGGCTATTCTTTTAGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 123)      Antisense primer:      5'-GTCACCCTCTAGATCTTCACAAACATTGGGAGTAGTATGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 124) Bold letters represented the coding sequence and the remaining sequence was homologous to insertion sites of pPFJ0355.      The expression vector pPFJ0355 contains the Aspergillus oryzae TAKA-amylase promoter, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase terminator elements, pUC19 derived sequences for selection and propagation in  coli, and an Aspergillus nidulans pyrG gene, which encodes an orotidine decarboxylase for selection of a transformant of a pyrG mutant Aspergillus strain.      Twenty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of Penicillium sp. NN051602 genomic DNA, 10  of 5X GC Buffer (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland), 1.5  of DMSO, 2.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 0.6 unit of PHUSION High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland), in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed using a Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) programmed for denaturing at 98C for 1 minutes; 5 cycles of denaturing at 98C for 15 seconds, annealing at 56C for 30 seconds, with a 1 C increase per cycle and elongation at 72C for 75 seconds; and 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 65C for 30 seconds and 72C for 75 seconds; and a final extension at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer where an approximately 1.4 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      Plasmid pPFJ0355 was digested with Bam I and Bgl II, isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together using an INFUSION CF Dry-down PCR Cloning Kit resulting in pPpin3 in which transcription of the Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase gene was under the control of a promoter from the gene for Aspergillus oryzae alpha-amylase. In brief, 30 ng of pPFJ0355 digested with Bam I and Bgl II, and 60 ng of the Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase gene purified PCR product were added to a reaction vial and resuspended in a final volume of 10  with addition of deionized water. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes and then 50C for 15 minutes. Three  of the reaction were used to transform  coli TOP10 competent cells. An . coli transformant containing pPpin3 was detected by colony PCR and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase gene insert in pPpin3 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA, USA).      The same PCR fragment was cloned into vector pGEM-T using a pGEM-T Vector System to generate pGEM-T-Ppin3. The Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase gene contained in pGEM-T-Ppin3 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer.  coli strain T-Ppin3, containing pGEM-T-Ppin3, was deposited with the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM), D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany on September 7, 2009, and assigned accession number DSM 22922.      DNA sequencing of the Penicillium pinophilum genomic clone encoding a GH10 polypeptide having xylanase activity was performed with an Applied Biosystems Model 3700 Automated DNA Sequencer using version 3.1 BIG-DYE terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and dGTP chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and primer walking strategy. Nucleotide sequence data were scrutinized for quality and all sequences were compared to each other with assistance of PHRED/PHRAP software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA).      The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the Penicillium pinophilum gh10 gene are shown in SEQ ID NO: 39 and SEQ ID NO: 40, respectively. The coding sequence is 1442 bp including the stop codon and is interrupted by three introns of 51 bp (199-249), 73 bp (383-455), and 94 bp (570-663). The encoded predicted protein is 407 amino acids. The%G+C of the coding sequence of the gene (including introns) is 47.99% G+C and the mature polypeptide coding sequence is 49.22%. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 19 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 388 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 41.5 kDa and an isoelectric pH of 5.03.      A comparative pairwise global alignment of amino acid sequences was determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of EMBOSS with gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 matrix. The alignment showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the Penicillium pinophilum gene encoding the GH10 polypeptide having xylanase activity shares 76% and 87% identity (excluding gaps) to the deduced amino acid sequence of a predicted GH10 family protein from Talaromyces emersonii (AAU99346) and Penicillium marneffei (B6QN64), respectively.      Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 (WO 95/35385 Example 1 ) protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422. Three g of pPpin3 were transformed into Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 .      The transformation of Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 with pPpin3 yielded about 50 transformants. Twelve transformants were isolated to individual Minimal medium plates.      Four transformants were inoculated separately into 3 ml of YPM medium in a 24-well plate and incubated at 30C with shaking at 150 rpm. After 3 days incubation, 20  of supernatant from each culture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting gel was stained with I NSTANT Blue (Expedeon Ltd., Babraham Cambridge, UK). SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the majority of the transformants had a major band of approximately 55 kDa. The expression strain was designated Aspergillus oryzae EXP02765.      A slant of one transformant, designated transformant 2, was washed with 10 ml of YPM and inoculated into a 2 liter flask containing 400 ml of YPM medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The culture was harvested on day 3 and filtered using a 0.45 m DURAPORE Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).      A 1 liter volume of supernatant of the recombinant Aspergillus oryzae strain EXP02765 was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation) and redissolved in 50 ml of 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.3, and then dialyzed against the same buffer and filtered through a 0.45  filter. The solution was applied to a 40 ml Q SEPHAROSE Fast Flow column column equilibrated in 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.3. The recombinant GH10 protein did not bind to the column. The fractions with xylanase activity were collected and evaluated by SDS-PAGE as described above. Fractions containing a band of approximately 55 kDa were pooled. The pooled solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration.      Example 21 : Preparation of Penicillium sp. GH61 polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity      Penicillium sp. GH61 polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity SEQ ID NO:     41 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 42 [deduced amino acid sequence]) according to the following procedure.      A compost sample was collected from Yunnan, China. Penicillium sp. NN051602 was isolated using single spore isolation techniques on PDA plates at 45C. The Penicillium sp. strain was inoculated onto a PDA plate and incubated for 4 days at 45C in the darkness.     Several mycelia-PDA plugs were inoculated into 500 ml shake flasks containing 100 ml of NNCYP-PCS medium. The flasks were incubated for 6 days at 45C with shaking at 160 rpm. The mycelia were collected at day 4, day 5, and day 6. Then the mycelia from each day were combined and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored in a -80C freezer until use.      The frozen mycelia were transferred into a liquid nitrogen prechilled mortar and pestle and ground to a fine powder. Total RNA was prepared from the powdered mycelia by extraction with TRIZOL reagent and purified using a RNEASY Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fifty micrograms of total RNA was submitted to sequencing as described above.      Total RNA enriched for polyA sequences with the mRNASeq protocol was sequenced using an ILLUMINA GA2 system (lllumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The raw 36 base pair reads were assembled with an in-house developed assembler. The assembled sequences were analyzed using standard bioinformatics methods for gene finding and functional prediction. ESTscan 2.0 was used for gene prediction. NCBI blastall version 2.2.10 and HMMER version 2.1 .1 were used to predict function based on structural homology. The Family GH61 candidate was identified directly by analysis of the Blast results.      Penicillium sp. NN051602 was grown on a PDA agar plate at 45C for 3 days. Mycelia were collected directly from the agar plate into a sterilized mortar and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder, and genomic DNA was isolated using a DNEASY Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).      Based on the ILLUMINA sequencing information of the Penicillium sp. GH61 gene obtained as described above, oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the GH61 gene from genomic DNA of Penicillium sp. NN051602. An IN-FUSION CF Dry-down Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pPFJ0355, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.

Twenty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of Penicillium sp. NN051602 genomic DNA, 10  of 5X GC Buffer, 1 .5  of DMSO, 2.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 0.6 unit of PHUSION High- Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland) in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed using a Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed for denaturing at 98C for 1 minutes; 5 cycles of denaturing at 98C for 15 seconds, annealing at 63C for 30 seconds, with a 1 C increase per cycle and elongation at 72C for 60 seconds; and 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds and 72C for 60 seconds; and a final extension at 72C for 5 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer where an approximately 0.9 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      Plasmid pPFJ0355 was digested with Bam I and Bgl II, isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together using an IN-FUSION CF Dry-down PCR Cloning Kit resulting in pGH61 D23Y4 in which transcription of the Penicillium sp. GH61 gene was under the control of a promoter from the gene for Aspergillus oryzae alpha-amylase. In brief, 30 ng of pPFJ0355 digested with Bam I and Bgl II, and 60 ng of the Penicillium sp. GH61 gene purified PCR product were added to a reaction vial and resuspended in a final volume of 10  I with addition of deionized water. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes and then 50C for 15 minutes. Three  of the reaction were used to transform E. coli TOP10 competent cells. An E. coli transformant containing pGH61 D23Y4 was detected by colony PCR and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The Penicillium sp. GH61 gene insert in pGH61 D23Y4 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer.      The same PCR fragment was cloned into vector pGEM-T using a pGEM-T Vector System to generate pGEM-T-GH61 D23Y4. The Penicillium sp. GH61 gene insert in pGEM- T-GH61 D23Y4 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer. E. coli strain T-51602, containing pGEM-T-GH61 D23Y4, was deposited with the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM), Mascheroder Weg 1 B, D- 38124 Braunschweig, Germany on August 26, 2009 and assigned accession number DSM 22882.      DNA sequencing of the Penicillium sp. genomic clone encoding a GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic-enhancing activity was performed with an Applied Biosystems Model 3700 Automated DNA Sequencer using version 3.1 BIG-DYE terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and dGTP chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and primer walking strategy. Nucleotide sequence data were scrutinized for quality and all sequences were compared to each other with assistance of PHRED/PHRAP software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA).      The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the Penicillium sp. gh61a gene are shown in SEQ ID NO: 45 and SEQ ID NO: 46, respectvely. The coding sequence is 835 bp including the stop codon and is interrupted by one intron of 73 bp (1 14- 186). The encoded predicted protein is 253 amino acids. The%G+C of the coding sequence of the gene (including introns) is 63.35% G+C and the mature polypeptide coding sequence is 64.62%. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 25 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 228 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 24.33 kDa and an isoelectric pH of 4.17.      A comparative pairwise global alignment of amino acid sequences was determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of EMBOSS with gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 matrix. The alignment showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the Penicillium gene encoding the GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic-enhancing activity shares 74% identity (excluding gaps) to the deduced amino acid sequence of a predicted GH61 family protein from Thermoascus aurantiacus (GENESEQP:AUM17198).      Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 (WO 95/35385 Example 1 ) protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422. Three g of pGH61 D23Y4 were used to transform Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 .      The transformation of Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 with pGH61 D23Y4 yielded about 50 transformants. Twelve transformants were isolated to individual Minimal medium plates.      Six transformants were inoculated separately into 3 ml of YPM medium in a 24-well plate and incubated at 30C, 150 rpm. After 3 days incubation, 20  of supernatant from each culture were analyzed on a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting gel was stained with INSTANT Blue (Expedeon Ltd., Babraham Cambridge, UK). SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the majority of the transformants had a major band of approximately 45 kDa. The expression strain was designated as Aspergillus oryzae EXP03089.      A slant of one transformant, designated transformant 1 , was washed with 10 ml of YPM medium and inoculated into a 2 liter flask containing 400 ml of YPM medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The culture was harvested on day 3 and filtered using a 0.45  DURAPORE Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).      A 400 ml volume of the filtered broth of the recombinant strain Aspergillus oryzae EXP03089 was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation) and redissolved in 20 ml of 25 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer, and then dialyzed against the same buffer and filtered through a 0.45  filter. The solution was applied to a 30 ml Q SEPHAROSE Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) equilibrated in 25 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0. The recombinant GH61 protein was eluted with a linear NaCI gradient (0-0.4 M). Fractions eluted with 0.1 -0.2 M NaCI were collected and dialyzed against the same equilibration buffer. The sample was further purified on a MONO Q column (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) with a linear NaCI gradient (0-0.3 M). Fractions were evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing a band of approximately 45 kDa were pooled. The pooled solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration.      Example 22: Preparation of Thielavia terrestris GH61 N polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity      Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 (SEQ ID NO: 43 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 44     [deduced amino acid sequence]) was prepared according to the following procedure.      Genomic sequence information was generated by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI). A preliminary assembly of the genome was downloaded from JGI and analyzed using the Pedant-Pro Sequence Analysis Suite (Biomax Informatics AG, Martinsried, Germany). Gene models constructed by the software were used as a starting point for detecting GH61 homologues in the genome. More precise gene models were constructed manually using multiple known GH61 protein sequences as a guide.      To generate genomic DNA for PCR amplification, Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 was grown in 50 ml of NNCYP medium supplemented with 1 % glucose in a baffled shake flask at 42C and 200 rpm for 24 hours. Mycelia were harvested by filtration, washed twice in TE (10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA), and frozen under liquid nitrogen. A pea-size piece of frozen mycelia was suspended in 0.7 ml of 1 % lithium dodecyl sulfate in TE and disrupted by agitation with an equal volume of 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA) for 45 seconds in a FastPrep FP120 (ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY, USA). Debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 10 minutes and the cleared supernatant was brought to 2.5 M ammonium acetate and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. After the incubation period, the nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of 2 volumes of ethanol. After centrifugation for 15 minutes in a microfuge at 4C, the pellet was washed in 70% ethanol and air dried. The DNA was resuspended in 120  of 0.1 X TE and incubated with 1  of DNase-free RNase A at 37C for 20 minutes. Ammonium acetate was added to 2.5 M and the DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. The pellet was washed in 70% ethanol, air dried, and resuspended in TE buffer.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below were designed to PCR amplify the Thielavia terrestris Family GH61 N gene from the genomic DNA. An IN-FUSION Cloning Kit was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector, pAILo2 (WO 2005/074647), without the need for restriction digests and ligation.      Forward primer:      5'-ACTGGATTTACCATGCCTTCTTTCGCCTCCAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 127)      Reverse primer:      5'-TCACCTCTAGTTAATTAATCAGTTTGCCTCCTCAGCCC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 128)      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pAILo2.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing 1 of Thielavia terrestris genomic DNA, 1X ADVANTAGE GC-Melt LA Buffer (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 1  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 1.25 units of ADVANTAGE GC Genomic LA Polymerase Mix (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), in a final volume of 25 . The amplification conditions were one cycle at 94C for 1 minute; and 30 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 60.5C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 1 minute. The heat block was then held at 72C for 5 minutes followed by a 4C soak cycle.     The reaction products were isolated by 1 .0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where an approximately 1.1 kb product band was excised from the gel and purified using a MINELUTE Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The fragment was then cloned into pAILo2 using an IN-FUSION Cloning Kit. The vector was digested with Nco I and Pac I. The fragment was purified by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer, excised from the gel, and purified using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The gene fragment and the digested vector were combined together in a reaction resulting in the expression plasmid pAG66, in which transcription of the Family GH61 N gene was under the control of the NA2-tpi promoter (a modified promoter from the gene encoding neutral alpha-amylase in Aspergillus niger in which the untranslated leader has been replaced by an untranslated leader from the gene encoding triose phosphate isomerase in Aspergillus nidulans). The recombination reaction (20 ) was composed of 1 X IN-FUSION Buffer (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 1 X BSA (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 1  of IN-FUSION enzyme (diluted 1 :10) (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 186 ng of pAILo2 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 96.6 ng of the Thielavia terrestris GH61 N purified PCR product. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes followed by 15 minutes at 50C. The reaction was diluted with 40  of TE buffer and 2.5  of the diluted reaction was used to transform E. coli TOP10 Competent cells. An E. coli transformant containing pAG66 (GH61 N gene) was identified by restriction enzyme digestion and plasmid DNA was prepared using a BIOROBOT 9600.      Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422. Five g of pAG43 was used to transform Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355. Three transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates.      Plugs were taken from the original transformation plate of each of the three transformants and added separately to 1 ml of M410 medium in 24 well plates, which were incubated at 34C. Five days after incubation, 7.5  of supernatant from each culture was analyzed using CRITERION stain-free, 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE, (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that several transformants had new major bands of approximately 70 kDa and 35 kDa.      Confluent PDA plates of two of the transformants were washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and inoculated into five 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of M410 medium and incubated to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The flasks were harvested on days 3 and 5 and filtered using a 0.22  stericup suction filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA).      Example 23: Preparation of Aspergillus aculeatus CBS 101.43 GH10 xylanase II      Aspergillus aculeatus CBS 101 .43 GH10 xylanase II (SEQ ID NO: 45 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 46 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was purified from SHEARZYME 2X-CDN01013. The sample was desalted and buffer-exchanged in 20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0 using a HIPREP 26/10 desalting column according to the manufacturer's instructions. The buffer exchanged sample was applied to a Q SEPHAROSE Big Beads column (64 ml) equilibrated with 20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, and the bound protein was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 500 mM sodium chloride over 10 column volumes. Fractions were pooled and concentrated into 200 mM sodium chloride-20 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit with bovine serum albumin as a protein standard.      Example 24: Preparation of Aspergillus fumigatus NN055679 GH10 xylanase      Aspergillus fumigatus NN055679 GH10 xylanase (xyn3) (SEQ ID NO: 47 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 48 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was prepared recombinantly according to WO 2006/078256 using Aspergillus oryzae BECh2 (WO 2000/39322) as a host.      The filtered broth was desalted and buffer-exchanged into 20 mM Tris -150 mM NaCI pH 8.5 using a HIPREP 26/10 Desalting Column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit with bovine serum albumin as a protein standard.      Example 25: Preparation of Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 GH10 xylanase      Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 was inoculated onto a PDA plate and incubated for 7 days at 28C. Several mycelia-PDA agar plugs were inoculated into 750 ml shake flasks containing 100 ml of MEX-1 medium. The flasks were agitated at 150 rpm for 9 days at 37C. The fungal mycelia were harvested by filtration through MIRACLOTH (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) before being frozen in liquid nitrogen. The mycelia were then pulverized into a powder by milling the frozen mycelia together with an equal volume of dry ice in a coffee grinder precooled with liquid nitrogen. The powder was transferred into a liquid nitrogen prechilled mortor and pestle and ground to a fine powder with a small amount of baked quartz sand. The powdered mycelial material was kept at -80C until use.      Total RNA was prepared from the frozen, powdered mycelium of Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 by extraction with guanidium thiocyanate followed by ultracentrifugation through a 5.7 M CsCI cushion according to Chirgwin et al., 1979, Biochemistry 18: 5294- 5299. The polyA enriched RNA was isolated by oligo (dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography according to Aviv et al., 1972, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 69: 1408-1412.      Double stranded cDNA was synthesized according to the general methods of Gubler and Hoffman, 1983, Gene 25: 263-269; Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F., and Maniantis, T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; and Kofod et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269: 29182-29189, using a polyA-/ I primer (Promega Corp., Madison, Wisconsin, USA). After synthesis, the cDNA was treated with mung bean nuclease, blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated to a 50-fold molar excess of Eco Rl adaptors (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cDNA was cleaved with Not I and the cDNA was size fractionated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer. The fraction of cDNA of 700 bp and larger was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The directional, size-fractioned cDNA was ligated into Eco RI-/ I cleaved pYES 2.0     (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The ligation reactions were performed by incubation at 16C for 12 hours, then heating at 70C for 20 minutes, and finally addition of 10  of water to each tube. One  of each ligation mixture was electroporated into 40  of electrocompetent E. coli DH10B cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described by Sambrook et al., 1989, supra.      The Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 library was established in E. coli consisting of pools. Each pool was made by spreading transformed E. coli on LB ampicillin plates, yielding 15,000-30,000 colonies/plate after incubation at 37C for 24 hours. Twenty ml of LB medium was added to the plate and the cells were suspended therein. The cell suspension was shaken in a 50 ml tube for 1 hour at 37C.      Plasmid DNA from several of the library pools of T. saccata CBS 804.70 was isolated using a Midi Plasmid Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stored at -20C.      One  aliquots of purified plasmid DNA from several of the library pools were transformed into S. cerevisiae W3124 by electroporation (Becker and Guarante, 1991 , Methods Enzymol. 194: 182-187) and the transformants were plated onto SC-agar plates containing 2% glucose and incubated at 30C. In total, 50-100 plates containing 250-400 yeast colonies were obtained from each pool. After 3-5 days of incubation, the SC agar plates were replica plated onto a set of 0.1 % AZCL xylan (oat) SC-URA agar plates with galactose. The plates were incubated for 2-4 days at 30C and xylanase positive colonies were identified as colonies surrounded by a blue halo. The positive clones were streak- purified and obtai strain CBS 521.95 ned as single colonies. Xylanase-expressing yeast colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of YPD medium in 25 ml tubes. The tubes were shaken overnight at 30C. One ml of the culture was centrifugated to pellet the yeast cells.      DNA was isolated according to WO 94/14953 and dissolved in 50  of water. The DNA was transformed into  coli DH10B using standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989, supra).      Plasmid DNA was isolated from the  coli transformants using standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989, supra). Plasmids were sequenced using both pYES primers as sequencing primers. One specific plasmid clone of 1283 bp designated TF12Xyl170 was found to encode a Family 10 glycoside hydrolase protein and was further characterized. More reliable sequence was obtained by further sequencing of the fragment using the specific primers shown below designed based on the initial sequence:      TF12Xyl170F1 :      5'-TGAAATGGGATGCTACTGA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 129)      TF12Xyl170F2:      5'-CAACGACTACAACATCGAGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 130)      TF12Xyl170R1 :      5'-ATTTGCTGTCCACCAGTGAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 131 )      One plasmid matching the original cDNA sequence was designated pTF12Xyl170 and the  coli strain containing this clone was designated . coli pTF12Xyl170 and deposited on July 28, 2009, with the Agricultural Research Service Patent Culture Collection, Northern Regional Research Center, Peoria, IL, USA, and given the accession number NRRL B-50309.      The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the Trichophaea saccata g 10a gene are shown in SEQ ID NO: 49 and SEQ ID NO: 50, respectively. The coding sequence is 1 197 bp including the stop codon. The encoded predicted protein contains 398 amino acids. The%G+C of the coding region of the gene is 53.6% and the mature polypeptide coding region is also 53.6%. Using the SignalP program, version 3 (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 19 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 379 amino acids with a molecular mass of 40.4 kDa.      Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the gh10a gene with the Interproscan program (Zdobnov and Apweiler, 2001 , Bioinformatics 17: 847-848) showed that the GH10A protein contained the core sequence typical of a Family 10 glycoside hydrolase, extending from approximately amino acid residue 65 to residue 377 of the predicted mature polypeptide. The GH10A protein also contained the sequence signature of a type I fungal cellulose binding domain (CBMI). This sequence signature known as Prosite Entry PS00562 (Sigrist et al., 2002, Brief Bioin form. 3: 265-274) was present from amino acid residue 8 to residue 35 of the predicted mature polypeptide.      A comparative pairwise global alignment of amino acid sequences was determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of EMBOSS with gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 matrix. The alignment showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the Trichophaea saccata gene encoding the GH10A mature polypeptide shared 62.6% and 62.0% identity (excluding gaps) to the deduced amino acid sequences of Family 10 glycoside hydrolase proteins from Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Meripilus giganteus, respectively (accession numbers UNIPROT:B7SIW2 and GENESEQP:AAW23327, respectively).      The Trichophaea saccata CBS 804.70 gh10a gene was excised from the pTF12xyl170 using Bam HI and Xho I, and ligated into the Aspergillus expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005/042735), also digested with Bam HI and Xho I, using standard methods (Sambrook et al., 1989, supra). The ligation reaction was transformed into E. coli TOP10 chemically competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight colonies were grown overnight in LB ampicillin medium and plasmid DNA was isolated using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Plasmids containing the correct size inserts were sequenced to determine integrity and orientation of the insert. Plasmid pDAu81#5 was found to be error free and was therefore chosen for scale-up.      Protoplasts of Aspergillus oryzae BECH2 (WO 2000/39322) were prepared as described in WO 95/02043. A. oryzae BECh2 was constructed as described in WO 00139322. One hundred microliters of protoplast suspension were mixed with 5-25 g of the Aspergillus expression vector pDAu81#5 in 10  of STC composed of 1.2 M sorbitol, 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCI2 (Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422). The mixture was left at room temperature for 25 minutes. Two hundred microliters of 60% PEG 4000 (BDH, Poole, England) (polyethylene glycol, molecular weight 4,000), 10 mM CaCI2, and 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5 were added and gently mixed and finally 0.85 ml of the same solution was added and gently mixed. The mixture was left at room temperature for 25 minutes, centrifuged at 2,500 x g for 15 minutes, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 1.2 M sorbitol. This sedimentation process was repeated, and the protoplasts were spread on COVE plates. After incubation for 4-7 days at 37C spores were picked and spread on COVE plates containing 0.01 % TRITON X-100 in order to isolate single colonies. The spreading was repeated twice more on COVE sucrose medium (Cove, 1996, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 133: 51-56) containing 1 M sucrose and 10 mM sodium nitrate.      Ten of the transformants were inoculated in 10 ml of YPG medium. After 3-4 days of incubation at 30C, 200 rpm, the supernatant was removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue and all isolates displayed a diffuse band between 35 and 45 kDa. These transformants were analyzed further for xylanase activity at pH 6.0 using a modified AZCL-arabinoxylan as substrate isolated from wheat (Megazyme, Wicklow, Ireland) in 0.2 M sodium phosphate pH 6.0 buffer containing 0.01 % TRITON X-100 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformant producing the highest level of activity was chosen for production of the xylanase.      The transformant producing the highest level of activity was grown using standard methods. The broth was filtered using Whatmann glass filters GF/D, GF/A, GF/C, GF/F (2.7 , 1.6 , 1.2  and 0.7 , respectively) (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ, USA) followed by filtration using a NALGENE bottle top 0.45  filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY, USA).      Ammonia sulfate was added to the filtered broth to a final concentration of 3 M and the precipitate was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 30 minutes. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 mM Tris/HCI pH 8.0 and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris/HCI pH 8.0 overnight. The dialyzed preparation was applied to a 150 ml Q SEPHAROSE Fast Flow column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris/HCI pH 8.0 and the enzyme was eluted with a 1050 ml (7 column volumes) linear salt gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCI in 10 mM Tris/HCI pH 8.0. Elution was followed at 280 nm and fractions were collected and assayed for xylanase activity using 0.2% AZCL-Arabinoxylan from wheat in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.0 containing 0.01 % TRITON X-100. Fractions containing xylanase activity were pooled and stored at - 20C. Example 26: Preparation of Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase      Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase (SEQ ID NO: 51 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 52 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was prepared according to the following procedure.      Compost samples were collected from Yunnan, China on December 12, 2000. Penicillium pinophilum NN046877 was isolated using single spore isolation techniques on PDA plates at 45C. Penicillium pinophilum strain NN046877 was inoculated onto a PDA plate and incubated for 4 days at 37C in the darkness. Several mycelia-PDA plugs were inoculated into 500 ml shake flasks containing 100 ml of NNCYP-PCS medium. The flasks were incubated for 5 days at 37C with shaking at 160 rpm. The mycelia were collected at day 4 and day 5. The mycelia from each day were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a - 80C freezer until use.      The frozen mycelia were transferred into a liquid nitrogen prechilled mortar and pestle and ground to a fine powder. Total RNA was prepared from the powdered mycelia of each day by extraction with TRIZOL reagent. The polyA enriched RNA was isolated using a mTRAP Total Kit.      Double stranded cDNA from each day was synthesized with a SMART cDNA library Construction Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). The cDNA was cleaved with Sfi I and the cDNA was size fractionated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer. The fraction of cDNA of 500 bp and larger was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then equal amounts of cDNA from day 4 and day 5 were pooled for library construction.      The pooled cDNA was then directionally cloned by ligation into Sfi I cleaved pMHas7     (WO 2009/037253) using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ligation mixture was electroporated into . coli ELECTROMAX DM 0B cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) using a GENE PULSER and Pulse Controller (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) at 25 uF, 25 mAmp, 1 .8 kV with a 1 mm gap cuvette according to the manufacturer's procedure.      The electroporated cells were plated onto LB plates supplemented with 50 mg of kanamycin per liter. A cDNA plasmid pool was prepared from 60,000 total transformants of the original pMHas7 vector ligation. Plasmid DNA was prepared directly from the pool of colonies using a QIAGEN Plasmid Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).      A transposon containing plasmid designated pSigA4 was constructed from the pSigA2 transposon containing plasmid described WO 2001/77315 in order to create an improved version of the signal trapping transposon of pSigA2 with decreased selection background. The pSigA2 transposon contains a signal less beta-lactamase construct encoded on the transposon itself. PCR was used to create a deletion of the intact beta lactamase gene found on the plasmid backbone using a proofreading Pfu Turbo polymerase PROOFSTART (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany) and the following 5' phosphorylated primers (TAG Copenhagen, Denmark):      SigA2NotU-P:      5'-TCGCGATCCGTTTTCGCATTTATCGTGAAACGCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 132)      SigA2NotD-P:      5'-CCGCAAACGCTGGTGAAAGTAAAAGATGCTGAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 133)      The amplification reaction was composed of 1  of pSigA2 (10 ng/ ), 5  of 10X PROOFSTART Buffer (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany), 2.5  of dNTP mix (20 mM), 0.5  of SigA2NotU-P (10 mM), 0.5  of SigA2NotD-P (10 mM), 10  of Q solution (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany), and 31.25  of deionized water. A DNA ENGINE Thermal Cycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was used for amplification programmed for one cycle at 95C for 5 minutes; and 20 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 62C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 4 minutes.      A 3.9 kb PCR reaction product was isolated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer and 0.1 g of ethidium bromide per ml. The DNA band was visualized with the aid of an EAGLE EYE Imaging System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) at 360 nm. The 3.9 kb DNA band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The 3.9 kb fragment was self-ligated at 16C overnight with 10 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), 9  of the 3.9 kb PCR fragment, and 1  of 10X ligation buffer (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA). The ligation was heat inactivated for 10 minutes at 65C and then digested with Dpn I at 37C for 2 hours. After incubation, the digestion was purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit.      The purified material was then transformed into E. coli TOP10 competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformation mixture was plated onto LB plates supplemented with 25 g of chloramphenicol per ml. Plasmid minipreps were prepared from several transformants and digested with Bgl II. One plasmid with the correct construction was chosen. The plasmid was designated pSigA4. Plasmid pSigA4 contains the Bgl II flanked transposon SigA2 identical to that disclosed in WO 2001/77315.      A 60  sample of plasmid pSigA4 DNA (0.3 9/) was digested with Bgl II and separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer. A SigA2 transposon DNA band of 2 kb was eluted with 200  of EB buffer (QIAGEN GmbH Corporation, Hilden, Germany) and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 200  of EB buffer. SigA2 was used for transposon assisted signal trapping.      A complete description of transposon assisted signal trapping is described in WO     2001/77315. The plasmid pool was treated with transposon SigA2 and HYPERMU transposase (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, Wl, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      For in vitro transposon tagging of the Penicillium pinophilum cDNA library, 2  of SigA2 transposon containing approximately 100 ng of DNA were mixed with 1  of the plasmid DNA pool of the Penicillium pinophilum cDNA library containing 1 g of DNA, 1  of HYPERMU transposase, and 2  of 10X buffer (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, Wl, USA) in a total volume of 20  and incubated at 30C for 3 hours followed by adding 2  of stop buffer (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, Wl, USA) and heat inactivation at 75C for 10 minutes. The DNA was precipitated by addition of 2  of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5 and 55  of 96% ethanol and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 10,000 x g, 4C. The pellet was washed in 70% ethanol, air dried at room temperature, and resuspended in 10  of deionized water.      A 2  volume of the transposon tagged plasmid pool was electroporated into 50  of E. coli ELECTROMAX DM OB cells (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a GENE PULSER and Pulse Controller at 25 uF, 25 mAmp, 1.8 kV with a 1 mm gap cuvette according to the manufacturer's procedure.      The electroporated cells were incubated in SOC medium with shaking at 225 rpm for 1 hour at 37C before being plated onto the following selective media: LB medium supplemented with 50 g of kanamycin per ml; LB medium supplemented with 50 g of kanamycin per ml and 15 g of chloramphencol per ml; and LB medium supplemented with 50 g of kanamycin per ml, 15 g of chloramphencol per ml, and 30 g of ampicillin per ml.      From plating of the electroporation onto LB medium supplemented with kanamycin, chloramphencol and ampicillin, approximately 200 colonies per 50  were observed after 3 days at 30C. All colonies were replica plated onto LB kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin medium described above. Five hundred colonies were recovered under this selection condition. The DNA from each colony was sequenced with the transposon forward and reverse primers (primers A and B), shown below, according to the procedure disclosed in WO 2001/77315 (page 28).      Primer A:      5'-agcgtttgcggccgcgatcc-3' (SEQ ID NO: 134)      Primer B:      5'-ttattcggtcgaaaaggatcc-3' (SEQ ID NO: 135)      DNA sequences were obtained from SinoGenoMax Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). Primer A and primer B sequence reads for each plasmid were trimmed to remove vector and transposon sequence. The assembled sequences were grouped into contigs by using the program PhredPhrap (Ewing et al., 1998, Genome Research 8: 175-185; Ewing and Green, 1998, Genome Research 8: 186-194). All contigs were subsequently compared to sequences available in standard public DNA and protein sequences databases (TrEMBL, SWALL, PDB, EnsemblPep, GeneSeqP) using the program BLASTX 2.0a19MP-WashU [14- Jul-1998] [Build Iinux-x86 18:51 :44 30-Jul-1998] (Gish et al., 1993, Nat. Genet. 3: 266-72). The family GH10 xylanase candidate was identified directly by analysis of the BlastX results.      Penicillium pinophilum NN046877 was grown on a PDA agar plate at 37C for 4-5 days. Mycelia were collected directly from the agar plate into a sterilized mortar and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder, and genomic DNA was isolated using a DNEASY Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).      Based on the Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase gene information obtained as described above, oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the GH61 gene from genomic DNA of Penicillium pinophilum GH10 NN046877. An IN-FUSION CF Dry-down Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pPFJ0355, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      Sense primer:      5'-ACACAACTGGGGATCCACCATGACTCTAGTAAAGGCTATTCTTTTAGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 136)      Antisense primer:      5'-GTCACCCTCTAGATCTTCACAAACATTGGGAGTAGTATGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 137)     Bold letters represented the coding sequence and the remaining sequence was homologous to insertion sites of pPFJ0355.      Twenty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of Penicillium sp. NN051602 genomic DNA, 10  of 5X GC Buffer, 1 .5  of DMSO, 2.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 0.6 unit of PHUSION High- Fidelity DNA Polymerase, in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed using a Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed for denaturing at 98C for 1 minutes; 5 cycles of denaturing at 98C for 15 seconds, annealing at 56C for 30 seconds, with a 1 C increase per cycle and elongation at 72C for 75 seconds; and 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 65C for 30 seconds and 72C for 75 seconds; and a final extension at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer where an approximately 1.4 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      Plasmid pPFJ0355 was digested with Bam I and Bgl II, isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together using an IN- FUSION CF Dry-down PCR Cloning Kit resulting in pPpin3 in which transcription of the Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase gene was under the control of a promoter from the gene for Aspergillus oryzae alpha-amylase. In brief, 30 ng of pPFJ0355 digested with Bam I and Bgl II, and 60 ng of the Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase gene purified PCR product were added to a reaction vial and resuspended in a final volume of 10  with addition of deionized water. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes and then 50C for 15 minutes. Three  of the reaction were used to transform E. coli TOP10 competent cells. An E. coli transformant containing pPpin3 was detected by colony PCR and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase gene insert in pPpin3 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer.      The same PCR fragment was cloned into vector pGEM-T using a pGEM-T Vector System to generate pGEM-T-Ppin3. The Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase gene contained in pGEM-T-Ppin3 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer. E. coli strain T-Ppin3, containing pGEM-T-Ppin3, was deposited with the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM), D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany on September 7, 2009, and assigned accession number DSM 22922.      DNA sequencing of the Penicillium pinophilum genomic clone encoding a GH10 polypeptide having xylanase activity was performed with an Applied Biosystems Model 3700 Automated DNA Sequencer using version 3.1 BIG-DYE terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and dGTP chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and primer walking strategy. Nucleotide sequence data were scrutinized for quality and all sequences were compared to each other with assistance of PHRED/PHRAP software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA).      The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the Penicillium pinophilum gh10 gene are shown in SEQ ID NO: 51 and SEQ ID NO: 52, respectively. The coding sequence is 1442 bp including the stop codon and is interrupted by three introns of 51 bp (199-249), 73 bp (383-455), and 94 bp (570-663). The encoded predicted protein is 407 amino acids. The%G+C of the coding sequence of the gene (including introns) is 47.99% G+C and the mature polypeptide coding sequence is 49.22%. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 19 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 388 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 41 .5 kDa and an isoelectric pH of 5.03.      A comparative pairwise global alignment of amino acid sequences was determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of EMBOSS with gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 matrix. The alignment showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the Penicillium pinophilum gene encoding the GH10 polypeptide having xylanase activity shares 76% and 87% identity (excluding gaps) to the deduced amino acid sequence of a predicted GH10 family protein from Talaromyces emersonii (AAU99346) and Penicillium marneffei (B6QN64), respectively.      Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 (WO 95/35385 Example 1 ) protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422. Three g of pPpin3 were transformed into Aspergillus oryzae HowB101.      The transformation of Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 with pPpin3 yielded about 50 transformants. Twelve transformants were isolated to individual Minimal medium plates.     Four transformants were inoculated separately into 3 ml of YPM medium in a 24-well plate and incubated at 30C with shaking at 150 rpm. After 3 days incubation, 20  of supernatant from each culture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting gel was stained with I NSTANT Blue (Expedeon Ltd., Babraham Cambridge, UK). SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the majority of the transformants had a major band of approximately 55 kDa. The expression strain was designated Aspergillus oryzae EXP02765.      A slant of one transformant, designated transformant 2, was washed with 10 ml of     YPM and inoculated into a 2 liter flask containing 400 ml of YPM medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The culture was harvested on day 3 and filtered using a 0.45 m DURAPORE Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).      A 1 liter volume of supernatant of the recombinant Aspergillus oryzae strain EXP02765 was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation) and redissolved in 50 ml of 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.3, and then dialyzed against the same buffer and filtered through a 0.45  filter. The solution was applied to a 40 ml Q SEPHAROSE Fast Flow column column equilibrated in 25 mM sodium acetate pH 4.3. The recombinant GH10 protein did not bind to the column. The fractions with xylanase activity were collected and evaluated by SDS-PAGE as described above. Fractions containing a band of approximately 55 kDa were pooled. The pooled solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration.      Example 27: Preparation of Thielavia terrestris GH10E xylanase      Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 GH10E xylanase (SEQ ID NO: 53 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 54 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was prepared according to the following procedure.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below were designed to PCR amplify the Thielavia terrestris gh10e gene from genomic DNA. An InFusion Cloning Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector, pAILo2 (WO 2005/074647).      Forward primer:      5'-ACTGGATTTACCATGGCCCTCAAATCGCTCCTGTTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 138)      Reverse primer:      5 '-T C AC CT CT AGTT AATTAATTAC AAG C ACTG AG AG TA-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 139)      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pAILo2.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing 2 g of Thielavia terrestris genomic DNA, 1X Pfx Amplification Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2X PCRX Enhancer solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1.5  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 2.5 units of PLATINUM Pfx DNA Polymerase, and 1  of 50 mM MgS04 in a final volume of 50 . The amplification conditions were one cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; and 30 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 59.5C for 30 seconds, and 68C for 150 seconds. The heat block was then held at 68C for 7 minutes followed by a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated on a 1 .0% agarose gel using TAE buffer and an approximately 1 .2 kb product band was excised from the gel and purified using a MINELUTE Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The fragment was then cloned into pAILo2 using an IN-FUSION Cloning Kit. The vector was digested with Nco I and Pac I (using conditions specified by the manufacturer). The fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis as above and a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit. The gene fragment and the digested vector were combined together in a reaction resulting in the expression plasmid pAG29, in which transcription of the gh10e gene was under the control of the NA2-tpi promoter (a hybrid of the promoters from the genes for Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase and Aspergillus nidulans triose phosphate isomerase). The recombination reaction (10 ) was composed of 1X InFusion Buffer (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), 1X BSA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), 0.5  of InFusion enzyme (diluted 1 :10) (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) , 93 ng of pAILo2 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 1  of the Thielavia terrestris gh10e purified PCR product. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes followed by 15 minutes at 50C. The reaction was diluted with 40  of TE buffer and 2.5  of the diluted reaction was used to transform E. coli SOLOPACK Gold cells.      Plasmid DNA was prepared using a BIOROBOT 9600 and a restriction enzyme digest performed. Putative pAG29 clones were digested with Pst I. The plasmid DNA from these clones was then sequenced to identify clones without PCR induced errors. Sequencing reactions contained 1.5  of plasmid DNA, 4.5  of water, and 4  of sequencing master-mix containing 1  of 5X sequencing buffer (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), 1  of BIGDYE terminator (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA), 1  of water and one of the following primers at 3.2 pmoles per reaction.      pAILo2 5'      5'-TGTCCCTTGTCGATGCG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 140)      pAILo2 3'      5'-CACATGACTTGGCTTCC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 141 ) Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422. Five g of pAG29 was used to transform Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355. Twenty-four transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates.      Confluent PDA plates of 24 transformants were washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN     20 and spores collected. Eight  of each spore stock was added to 1 ml of YPG, YPM, and M410 separately in 24 well plates and incubated at 34C. Three days after incubation, 7.5  of supernatant from selected culture was analyzed using Criterion stain-free, 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE, (BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS- PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that several transformants had a new major band of approximately 50 kDa and the best expression in M410. After a total of six days of incubation, all M410 cultures were sampled as described above and analyzed using Criterion stain-free, 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE gel, (BioRad, Hercules, CA) at which point the transformant exhibiting the best expression was selected.      A confluent PDA plate of the top transformant was washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and inoculated into five 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of M410 medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The flasks were harvested on day 5. Broths were filtered using a 0.22  stericup suction filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Example 28: Preparation of Thermobifida fusca GH11 xylanase      A linear integration vector-system was used for the expression cloning of a Thermobifida fusca DSM 22883 GH1 1 xylanase gene (SEQ ID NO: 55 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 56 [deduced amino acid sequence]). The linear integration construct was a PCR fusion product made by fusion of each gene between two Bacillus subtils homologous chromosomal regions along with a strong promoter and a chloramphenicol resistance marker. The fusion was made by SOE PCR (Horton et al., 1989, Gene 77: 61 -68). The SOE PCR method is also described in WO 2003/095658. Each gene was expressed under the control of a triple promoter system (as described in WO 99/43835), consisting of the promoters from Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene (amyL), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene (amyQ), and the Bacillus thuringiensis crylllA promoter including stabilizing sequence. The gene coding for chloramphenicol acetyl- transferase was used as marker (Diderichsen et al., 1993, Plasmid 30: 312). The final gene construct was integrated into the Bacillus chromosome by homologous recombination into the pectate lyase locus.      The GH1 1 xylanase gene (SEQ ID NO: 55 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 56     [deduced amino acid sequence]) was isolated from Thermobifida fusca DSM 22883 (NN018438) by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR1 ) using the primers shown in the table below. The primers are based on the protein sequence UNIPROT:Q5RZ98. Thermobifida fusca DSM 22883 was isolated from a soil sample obtained from Oahu, Hawaii in 2001 . The xylanase gene was cloned as a full-length gene and as a truncated gene. The genes were designed to contain a C-terminal HQHQHQH tag to ease purification but the His-tag was not used for the purification. The forward primer Ocs3 was designed so the gene was amplified from the start codon (ATG) and has 24 bases overhang (shown in italic in the table below). This overhang is complementary to part of one of the two linear vector fragments and is used when the PCR fragment and the vector fragments are assembled (described below). The reverse primer Ocs1 was designed to amplify the truncated version of the gene while the reverse primer Ocs2 was designed to amplify the full-length gene. Both Ocs1 and Ocs2 carry an overhang consisting of 24 bp encoding a HQHQHQH-tag and a stop codon (the overhang is shown in italic in the table below). This overhang is complementary to part of one of the two linear vector fragments and is used when the PCR fragment and the vector fragments are assembled (described below).      A PCR fragment was isolated containing the full-length xylanase gene and the short     24 bp flanking DNA sequences included in the primers as overhang. Another PCR fragment was isolated containing the truncated xylanase gene and the same short 24 bp flanking DNA sequences.      For each gene construct 3 fragments were PCR amplified: the gene fragment from genomic DNA from the Thermobifida fusca (N N018438), the upstream flanking fragment was amplified with primers 260558 and iMB1361 Uni1 , and the downstream flanking fragment was amplified with primers 260559 and oth432 from genomic DNA of the strain iMB1361 (described in patent application WO 2003095658). All primers used are listed in Table below.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""065874491-imgf000260_0001"" />Upstream flanking 260558: 1361 Uni1 :      fragment 5'-GAGTATCGCCAGTAAGGGG 5'-TCTTTATCCTCTCCTTTTTTT      CG 3' (SEQ ID NO: 145) CAGAGCTC 3' (SEQ ID NO:      146)      Downstream oth432: 260559:      flanking fragment 5'-CATCAGCACCAACACCAGCA 5'-GCAGCCCTAAAATCGCATAA      TCCGTAATCGCATGTTCAATCC AGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 148) GCTCCATA 3' (SEQ ID NO: 147)      The gene fragment was amplified using a proofreading polymerase PHUSION DNA Polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions with the addition of 2% DMSO. The two flanking DNA fragments were amplified with an EXPAND High Fidelity PCR System according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; 10 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 50C for 45 seconds, 68C for 4 minutes; 20 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 50C for 45 seconds, and 68C for 4 minutes (+20 seconds extension pr cycle); and one cycle at 68C for 10 minutes The 3 PCR fragments were subjected to a subsequent splicing by overlap extension (SOE) PCR reaction to assemble the 3 fragments into one linear vector construct. This was performed by mixing the 3 fragments in equal molar ratios and a new PCR reaction was run under the following conditions: one cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; 10 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 50C for 45 seconds, and 68C for 5 minutes; 10 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 50C for 45 seconds, and 68C for 8 minutes; 15 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 50C for 45 seconds, and 68C for 8 minutes (in addition 20 seconds extra per cycle). After the first cycle the two end primers 260558 and 260559 were added (20 pMol of each). Two  of the PCR product was transformed into Bacillus subtilis. Transformants were selected on LB plates supplemented with 6 g of chloramphenicol per ml. The full-length xylanase coding sequence was integrated by homologous recombination into the genome of the Bacillus subtilis host TH1 {amy-, spo-, apr-, npr-; WO 2005/038024). The truncated xylanase coding sequence was integrated by homologous recombination into the genome of the Bacillus subtilis host PL2317 {amy-, spo-, apr-, npr-, xyl-).      Transformants were then screened for their ability to produce large amounts of active xylanase. The screening was based on intensity of the band corresponding to the heterologous expressed protein by SDS-PAGE analysis and activity of the enzyme on LB agar plates containing AZCL-xylan (Megazyme International Ireland, Ltd., Wicklow, Ireland).      One transformant, Bacillus subtilis EXP01687, was isolated which contained the full- length xylanase gene expressed in the host strain Bacillus subtilis TH 1. The full-length xylanase gene sequence of Bacillus subtilis EXP01687 was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The protein sequence differs by 2 amino acids from UNIPROT:Q5RZ98.      Another transformant, Bacillus subtilis EXP01672, was isolated which contains the truncated xylanase gene expressed in the host strain Bacillus subtilis PL2317. The truncated xylanase gene sequence of Bacillus subtilis EXP01672 was confirmed by Sanger sequencing to encode the secretion signal and mature amino acid sequence to proline at position 236 of SEQ ID NO: 56. The protein sequence differs by 2 amino acids from UNIPROT:Q5RZ98.      Bacillus subtilis EXP01687 was grown in 500 ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks containing Cal-18 medium supplemented with 34 mg of chloramphenicol per liter for 2 days at 37C with shaking at 200 rpm. The enzyme was purified from the culture supernatant according to the protocol described below.      In step 1 , the whole culture (800 ml) was centrifuged at 17,600 x g for 30 minutes and then filtered through a SEITZ-EKS filter (Pall Seitzschenk Filtersystems GmbH, Bad Kreuznach, Germany). Sodium chloride was added to the filtered sample to 50 mM NaCI and the pH was adjusted to pH 7.5. The sample (750 ml) was applied to a 20 ml Ni SEPHAROSE 6 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated with 50 mM Na2HP04, 50 mM NaCI pH 7.5, and the bound protein was eluted with a 5 column volume gradient to 100% 50 mM Na2HP04, 500 mM imidazol pH 7.5. The enzyme was found in the effluent by SDS-PAGE analysis revealing a protein of the correct size in the effluent and nothing of the correct size in the eluent. This result was confirmed by activity measurement using AZCL-arabinoxylan (wheat) as substrate as described above.      In step 2, ammonium sulfate was added to the effluent (of step 1 ) to 1 M and the pH adjusted to 7.5. The sample (800 ml) was applied to a 60 ml TOYOPEARL Phenyl-650M column (TOSOH Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 1 M ammonium sulfate pH 7.5. The bound protein was eluted with Milli-Q ultrapure water (Millipore, Biiierica. MA, USA). Fractions with A28o were pooled (55 ml). The pooled fractions were desalted and buffer-exchanged with 25 mM acetic acid pH 4.5 using a HIPREP 26/10 desalting column according to the manufacturer's instructions.      In step 3, the buffer exchanged sample of step 2 (1 10 ml) was diluted 2.5-fold with Milli-Q ultrapure water and applied to a 10 ml SP SEPHAROSE Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated with 25 mM acetic acid pH 4.5. The bound protein was eluted with a five column volume gradient from 0 to 500 mM sodium chloride in 25 mM acetic acid pH 4.5. Based on SDS-PAGE analysis and A28o and A26o fractions were pooled (10 ml).      In step 4, the pooled fractions of step 3 were diluted 25-fold with Milli-Q ultrapure water and the pH was adjusted to pH 6.0 and applied to 10 ml SP SEPHAROSE Fast Flow column equilibrated with 5 mM succinic acid pH 6.0. The bound protein was eluted with a ten column volume gradient from 0 to 500 mM sodium chloride in 5 mM succinic acid pH 6.0. Based on SDS-PAGE analysis and A28o and A26o fractions were pooled (12 ml). Separate portions of the pooled fractions were then subjected to three different steps (steps 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c)) described below.      In step 5(a), 6 ml of the pooled fractions of step 4 were diluted to 25 ml with Milli-Q ultrapure water and the pH was adjusted to pH 9.0 and applied to a 1 ml RESOURCE Q column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated with 25 mM boric acid pH 9.0. The bound protein was eluted with a ten column volume gradient from 0 to 500 mM sodium chloride in 25 mM boric acid pH 9.0. Based on A28o and A260, the protein was in the effluent (35 ml). This sample was concentrated using an AMICON ultrafiltration cell equipped with a 5 kDa cut-off membrane (Millipore, BiS!erica, MA, USA).      In step 5(b), 3 ml of the pool of step 4 were diluted to 30 ml with Milli-Q ultrapure water and pH was adjusted to pH 9.6 and applied to a 1 ml RESOURCE Q column equilibrated with 12.5 mM boric acid pH 9.7. The bound protein was eluted with a ten column volume gradient from 0 to 500 mM sodium chloride in 12.5 mM boric acid pH 9.7. Based on A28o and A260 and SDS-PAGE analysis, the protein was in the effluent (36 ml).      In step 5(c), one quarter of the pool of step 4 was diluted with Milli-Q ultrapure water and the pH was adjusted to pH 8.0 and applied to a 1 ml RESOURCE Q column equilibrated with 25 mM borate pH 8.0. The bound protein was eluted with a ten column volume gradient from 0 to 500 mM sodium chloride in 25 mM borate pH 8.0. Based on A280 and A26o and SDS-PAGE analysis, the protein was in the effluent (25 ml).      In step 6, the sample from step 5(a), the effluent from step 5(b), and the effluent from step 5(c) were pooled and diluted with 25 mM acetic acid pH 4.5, and the pH was adjusted to pH 4.58. The pooled sample (100 ml) was applied to a 1 ml HITRAP SP Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated with 25 mM acetic acid pH 4.5. The bound protein was eluted with one column volume gradient from 0 to 500 mM sodium chloride in 25 mM acetic acid pH 4.5. Based on SDS-PAGE analysis and A280 and A260 fractions were pooled (3.5 ml). The MW of the purified xylanase was 20-25 kDa based on SDS-PAGE analysis.      Example 29: Preparation of Trichoderma reesei RutC30 GH3 beta-xylosidase      A Trichoderma reesei RutC30 beta-xylosidase gene (SEQ I D NO: 57 [DNA sequence] and SEQ I D NO: 58 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was isolated by screening a Lambda ZAP-CMR XR Library prepared from T. reesei RutC30 genomic DNA using a Lambda ZAP-CMR XR Library Construction Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. T. reesei RutC30 genomic DNA was prepared using standard methods. A DNA segment encoding 2300 bp of the T. reesei beta-xylosidase was amplified using the PCR primers shown below.      Forward Primer:      5'-gtgaataacgcagctcttctcg-3' (SEQ ID NO: 149)      Reverse Primer:      5'-ccttaattaattatgcgtcaggtgt-3' (SEQ ID NO: 150)      Primer 994768 was designed to amplify from the first base after the beta-xylosidase start site and primer 994769 was designed with a Pac I site at the 5' end.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction consisting of 50 ng of plasmid DNA from the lamda zap library, 1  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 5  of 10X PLATINUM Pfx DNA Polymerase Buffer, and 1 unit of PLATINUM Pfx DNA Polymerase, in a final volume of 50 . An EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 was used to amplify the DNA fragment programmed for one cycle at 95C for 3 minutes; and 30 cycles each at 94C for 45 seconds, 55C for 60 seconds, and 72C for 1 minute 30 seconds. After the 30 cycles, the reaction was incubated at 72C for 10 minutes and then cooled to 4C until further processing.      A 2.3 kb PCR product was purified by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer, excised from the gel, and purified using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit. The 2.3 kb PCR product was then digested with Pac I to facilitate insertion into pAILol (WO 2004/099228).      The pAILol vector was digested with Nco I and then filled in using T4 polymerase     (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. A second enzyme, Pac I, was then used to digest the 5' end of pAILol and the reaction was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis as described above to isolate a 6.9 kb vector fragment.      The 2.3 kb beta-xylosidase fragment was then ligated into the 6.9 kb vector fragment and transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue Subcloning Competent Cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Transformants were screened using restriction digest analysis in order to identify those with the correct insert. A new expression vector, pSaMe04, was confirmed by sequencing using an ABI3700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and dye terminator chemistry (Giesecke et al., 1992, Journal of Virology Methods 38: 47-60).      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below were designed to PCR amplify the Trichoderma reesei beta-xylosidase gene from pSaMe04 to construct a Trichoderma expression vector. An IN-FUSION Cloning Kit was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pMJ09 (WO 2005/056772), without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      TrBXYL-F (ID 064491 ): 5'-CGGACTGCGCACCATGGTGAATAACGCAGCTCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 151 ) TrBXYL-R (ID 064492):      5'-TCGCCACGGAGCTTATTATGCGTCAGGTGTAGCAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 152)      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pMJ09.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of 50 ng of pSaMe04, 1  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 5  of 10X ACCUTAQ DNA Polymerase Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 5 units of ACCUTAQ DNA Polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), in a final volume of 50 . An EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 was used to amplify the DNA fragment programmed for one cycle at 95C for 3 minutes; and 30 cycles each at 94C for 45 seconds, 55C for 60 seconds, and 72C for 1 minute 30 seconds. After the 30 cycles, the reaction was incubated at 72C for 10 minutes and then cooled to 4C until further processing.      The reaction products were isolated by 1 .0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where a 1.2 kb product band was excised from the gel and purified using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The 1.2 kb fragment was then cloned into pMJ09 using an IN-FUSION Cloning Kit. The vector was digested with Nco I and Pac I and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis as described above. The gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together in a reaction resulting in the expression plasmid pSaMe-TrBXYL in which transcription of the beta-xylosidase gene was under the control of the T. reesei cbhl gene promoter. The ligation reaction (50 ) was composed of 1X IN-FUSION Buffer, 1X BSA, 1  of INFUSION enzyme (diluted 1 :10), 100 ng of pMJ09 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 100 ng of the Trichoderma reesei beta-xylosidase purified PCR product. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. One  of the reaction was used to transform E. coli XL10 SOLOPACK Gold cells. An E. coli transformant containing pSaMe-TrBXYL was detected by restriction enzyme digestion and plasmid DNA was prepared using a BIOROBOT 9600. DNA sequencing of the Trichoderma reesei beta-xylosidase gene from pSaMe-TrBXYL was performed using dye-terminator chemistry (Giesecke et al., 1992, supra) and primer walking strategy.      Plasmid pSaMe-AaXYL was constructed to comprise the Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I gene promoter and terminator and the Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 xylanase coding sequence.      Cloning of the Aspergillus aculeatus xylanase followed the overall expression cloning protocol as outlined in H. Dalb0ge et al., 1994, Mol. Gen. Genet. 243: 253-260. RNA was isolated from Aspergillus aculeatus CBS 101.43 mycelium. Poly(A)<+> RNA was isolated from total RNA by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized as described by Maniatis et al. (Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1982). After synthesis the cDNA was treated with mung bean nuclease, blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated to non- palindromic Bst XI adaptors (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cDNA was size fractionated by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where fragments ranging from 600 bp to 4000 bp were used in the library construction. The DNA was ligated into Bst Xl-digested pYES 2.0 between the GAL1 promoter and the iso-1 -cytochrome c terminator and transformed into Escherichia coli MC1061 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA. The library was plated onto LB plates and incubated overnight at 37C. The colonies were scraped from the plates and resuspended in LB medium supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. Plasmid DNA was isolated using a Plasmid Midi Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valenicia, CA, USA). The purified plasmid DNA was pooled.      The purified plasmid DNA mixture was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae     W3124 cells (MATa; ura 3-52; leu 2-3, 1 12; his 3-D200; pep 4-1 137; prcl::HIS3; prbl:: LEU2; cir+; van den Hazel et al. , 1992, Eur. J. Biochem. 207: 277-283). Cultivation, transformation and media were as described by Guthrie et al., 1991 , Meth. Enzymol. Vol 194, Academic Press. The transformed cells were plated onto synthetic complete agar containing 2% glucose for 3 days at 30C. After 3 days the colonies were replica plated to SC medium with 2% galactose and incubated for 4 days at 30C. Xylanase expressing colonies were identified by 1 % agarose overlay with 0.1 % AZCL-Birch-Xylan at pH 4.5 (Dalb0ge, 2006, FEMS Microbiology Reviews 21 : 29-42). Colonies expressing xylanase activity were surrounded by a blue zone. Plasmid DNA, rescued from the positive colonies, contained a DNA insert of approximately 1.3 kb. Sequencing of the isolated gene fragment revealed a 1218 bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide with a theoretical molecular weight of 43.0 kDa. The cDNA fragment was subcloned into the Aspergillus expression vector pHD464 (Dalb0ge and Heldt-Hansen, 1994, Mol. Gen. Genet. 243, 253-260) digested with Bam HI and Xho I by cutting the clone with Bam Hi and Xho I and isolating the 1.2 kb cDNA insert (Christgau et a/., 1996, Biochem. J. 319: 705-712) to generate plasmid pA2X2.      The Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 xylanase coding sequence was PCR amplified using plasmid pA2x2 as template and primers 153505 and 153506 shown below using standard methods to yield an approximately 1.2 kb fragment. The 1.2 kb fragment was digested with Bam HI and Xho I (introduced in the PCR primers) and cloned into vector pCaHj527 (WO 2004/099228). The resulting plasmid was designated pMT2155 in which the cDNA was under transcriptional control of the neutral amylase II (NA2) promoter from A. niger and the AMG terminator from A. niger. Primer 153505:      5'-TCTTGGATCCACCATGGTCGGACTGCTTTCAATCACC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 153)      Primer 153506:      5'-TTAACTCGAGTCACAGACACTGCGAGTAATAGTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 154)      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below were designed to PCR amplify the Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 gene from plasmid pMT2155 and introduce flanking regions for insertion into expression vector pMJ09 (WO 2005/056772). Bold letters represent coding sequence and the remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pMJ09.      Forward Primer:      5'-cggactgcgcaccatggtcggactgctttcaat-3' (SEQ ID NO: 155)      Reverse Primer:      5'-tcgccacggagcttatcacagacactgcgagtaat-3' (SEQ ID NO: 156)      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction consisting of 50 ng of pMT2155, 1  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 5  of 10X ACCUTAQ DNA Polymerase Buffer, and 5 units of ACCUTAQ DNA Polymerase, in a final volume of 50 . An EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 was used to amplify the DNA fragment programmed for one cycle at 95C for 3 minutes; and 30 cycles each at 94C for 45 seconds, 55C for 60 seconds, and 72C for 1 minute 30 seconds. After the 30 cycles, the reaction was incubated at 72C for 10 minutes and then cooled to 4C until further processing.      The reaction products were isolated on a 1.0% agarose gel using TAE buffer where a 1 .2 kb product band was excised from the gel and purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The fragment was then cloned into pMJ09 using an IN-FUSION Cloning Kit. The vector was digested with Nco I and Pac I and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis as described above. The 1.2 kb gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together in a reaction resulting in the expression plasmid pSaMe-AaXYL in which transcription of the Family GH10 gene was under the control of the T. reesei cbhl promoter. The ligation reaction (50 ul) was composed of 1X IN-FUSION Buffer, 1X BSA, 1  of IN-FUSION enzyme (diluted 1 :10), 100 ng of pAILo2 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 100 ng of the Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 xylanase purified PCR product. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. One  of the reaction was used to transform E. coli XL10 SOLOPACK Gold cells according to the manufacturer. An E. coli transformant containing pSaMe-AaGH10 was detected by restriction enzyme digestion and plasmid DNA was prepared using a BIOROBOT 9600. DNA sequencing of the Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 gene from pSaMe-AaXYL was performed using dye-terminator chemistry (Giesecke et al., 1992, supra) and primer walking strategy.      Plasmids pSaMe-AaXYL encoding the Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 endoglucanase and pSaMe-TrBXYL encoding the Trichoderma reesei beta-xylosidase were co-transformed into Trichoderma reesei RutC30 by PEG-mediated transformation (Penttila et al., 1987, Gene 61 155-164) to generate T. reesei strain SaMe-BXX13. Each plasmid contained the Aspergillus nidulans amdS gene to enable transformants to grow on acetamide as the sole nitrogen source.      Trichoderma reesei RutC30 was cultivated at 27C and 90 rpm in 25 ml of YP medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose and 10 mM uridine for 17 hours. Mycelia were collected by filtration using a Vacuum Driven Disposable Filtration System (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and washed twice with deionized water and twice with 1.2 M sorbitol. Protoplasts were generated by suspending the washed mycelia in 20 ml of 1.2 M sorbitol containing 15 mg of GLUCANEX (Novozymes A S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) per ml and 0.36 units of chitinase (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) per ml and incubating for 15-25 minutes at 34C with gentle shaking at 90 rpm. Protoplasts were collected by centrifuging for 7 minutes at 400 x g and washed twice with cold 1 .2 M sorbitol. The protoplasts were counted using a haemacytometer and re-suspended in STC to a final concentration of 1 X 10<8> protoplasts per ml. Excess protoplasts were stored in a Cryo 1 C Freezing Container (Nalgene, Rochester, NY, USA) at -80C.      Approximately 4 g of plasmids pSaMe-AaXYL and pSaMe-TRBXYL were digested with Pme I and added to 100  of protoplast solution and mixed gently, followed by 250  of 10 mM CaCI2-10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5-60% PEG 4000, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. STC (3 ml) was then added and mixed and the transformation solution was plated onto COVE plates using Aspergillus nidulans amdS selection. The plates were incubated at 28C for 5-7 days. Transformants were sub-cultured onto COVE2 plates and grown at 28C.      Over 40 transformants were subcultured onto fresh plates containing acetamide and allowed to sporulate for 7 days at 28C.      The Trichoderma reesei transformants were cultivated in 125 ml baffled shake flasks containing 25 ml of cellulase-inducing medium at pH 6.0 by inoculating spores of the transformants and incubating at 28C and 200 rpm for 7 days. Trichoderma reesei RutC30 was run as a control. Culture broth samples were removed at day 5. One ml of each culture broth was centrifuged at 15,700 x g for 5 minutes in a micro-centrifuge and the supernatants transferred to new tubes.      SDS-PAGE was performed using CRITERION Tris-HCI (5% resolving) gels (Bio-     Rad Laboratories, Inc.) with a CRITERION System. Five  of day 7 supernatants (see above) were suspended in 2X concentration of Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and boiled in the presence of 5% beta- mercaptoethanol for 3 minutes. The supernatant samples were loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis with 1X Tris/Glycine/SDS as running buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The resulting gel was stained with BIO-SAFE Coomassie Stain. The transformant showing the highest expression of both the A. aculeatus GH10 xylanase and the T. reesei beta-xylosidase based on the protein gel was designated T. reesei SaMe-BXX13.      Trichoderma reesei SaMe-BXX13 was cultivated in 500 ml baffled shake flasks containing 250 ml of cellulase-inducing medium at pH 6.0 inoculated with spores of T. reesei SaMe-BXX13. Shake flasks were incubated at 28C at 200 rpm for five days. The culture broth was then filtered using an 0.22  EXPRESS Plus Membrane.      The filtered broth was concentrated and buffer exchanged using a tangential flow concentrator equipped with a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane to pH 4.0 with acetic acid. Sample was loaded onto a SP SEPHAROSE column equilibrated in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0, eluting bound proteins with a gradient of 0-1000 mM sodium chloride. Fractions were buffer exchanged into 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 using a tangential flow concentrator and applied to a Phenyl SUPEROSE column (HR 16/10) equilibrated with 1 .5 M (NH4)2SO4-20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient over 20 column volumes from 1.5 to 0 M (NH4)2S04 in 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.0. The protein fractions were buffer exchanged into 20 mM TEA HCI pH 7.5 using a tangential flow concentrator. Sample was applied to a MonoQ column, equilibrated in 20 mM TEA HCI pH 7.5, eluting bound proteins with a gradient from 0-300 mM sodium chloride. Buffer of final protein fractions was 20 mM TEA-100 mM sodium chloride pH 7.5. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 30: Preparation of Talaromyces emersonii CBS 393.64 GH3 beta-xylosidase     Talaromyces emersonii CBS 393.64 (NN005049) beta-xylosidase (SEQ ID NO: 59 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 60 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was prepared recombinantly according to Rasmussen et al., 2006, Biotechnology and Bioengineering 94: 869-876 using Aspergillus oryzae JaL355 as a host (WO 2003/070956).      The Talaromyces emersonii beta-xylosidase was purified according to Rasmussen et al., 2006, supra.      Example 31 : Preparation of Trichoderma reesei RutC30 Cel7B endoglucanase I Trichoderma reesei RutC30 Cel7B endoglucanase I (EGI) (SEQ ID NO: 61 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 62 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was prepared recombinantly according to WO 2005/067531 using Aspergillus oryzae Jal_250 as a host.      The harvested broth was centrifuged in 500 ml bottles at 13,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4C and then sterile filtered using a 0.22  polyethersulfone membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The filtered broth was concentrated and buffer exchanged with 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.5 using a tangential flow concentrator equipped with a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane. The sample was loaded onto a Q SEPHAROSE High Performance column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.5, and step eluted with equilibration buffer containing 600 mM NaCI. Flow-through and eluate fractions were analyzed by SGS-PAGE gel analysis using a CRITERION stain-free imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The eluate fractions containing Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI were pooled, concentrated and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.5. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 32: Preparation of Trichoderma reesei RutC30 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I     Trichoderma reesei RutC30 Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) (SEQ ID NO: 63 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 64 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was prepared as described by Ding and Xu, 2004, ""Productive cellulase adsorption on cellulose"" in Lignocellulose Biodegradation (Saha, B. C. ed.), Symposium Series 889, pp. 154-169, American Chemical Society, Washington, DC. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Example 33: Preparation of Trichoderma reesei RutC30 Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II     The Trichoderma reesei RutC30 Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II gene (SEQ ID NO: 65 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 66 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was isolated from Trichoderma reesei RutC30 as described in WO 2005/056772.      The Trichoderma reesei Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II gene was expressed in Fusarium venenatum using pEJG61 as an expression vector according to the procedures described in U.S. Published Application No. 20060156437. Fermentation was performed as described in U.S. Published Application No. 20060156437.      Filtered broth was desalted and buffer-exchanged into 20 mM sodium acetate-150 mM NaCI pH 5.0 using a HIPREP 26/10 Desalting Column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Example 34: Pretreated corn stover hydrolysis assay      Corn stover was pretreated at the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) using 1.4 wt% sulfuric acid at 165C and 107 psi for 8 minutes. The water-insoluble solids in the pretreated corn stover (PCS) contained 56.5% cellulose, 4.6% hemicellulose and 28.4% lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose were determined by a two-stage sulfuric acid hydrolysis with subsequent analysis of sugars by high performance liquid chromatography using NREL Standard Analytical Procedure #002. Lignin was determined gravimetrically after hydrolyzing the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions with sulfuric acid using NREL Standard Analytical Procedure #003.      Unmilled, unwashed PCS (whole slurry PCS) was prepared by adjusting the pH of     PCS to 5.0 by addition of 10 M NaOH with extensive mixing, and then autoclaving for 20 minutes at 120C. The dry weight of the whole slurry PCS was 29%. The PCS was used unwashed or washed with water. Milled unwashed PCS (dry weight 32.35%) was prepared by milling whole slurry PCS in a Cosmos ICMG 40 wet multi-utility grinder (EssEmm Corporation, Tamil Nadu, India). Milled washed PCS (dry weight 32.35%) was prepared in the same manner, with subsequent washing with deionized water and decanting off the supernatant fraction repeatedly.      The hydrolysis of PCS was conducted using 2.2 ml deep-well plates (Axygen, Union City, CA, USA) in a total reaction volume of 1.0 ml. The hydrolysis was performed with 50 mg of PCS (insoluble solids in case of unwashed PCS and total solids in case of washed PCS) per ml of 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate and various protein loadings of various enzyme compositions (expressed as mg protein per gram of cellulose). Enzyme compositions were prepared and then added simultaneously to all wells in a volume ranging from 50  to 200 , for a final volume of 1 ml in each reaction. The plate was then sealed using an ALPS-300 plate heat sealer (Abgene, Epsom, United Kingdom), mixed thoroughly, and incubated at a specific temperature for 72 hours. All experiments reported were performed in triplicate.      Following hydrolysis, samples were filtered using a 0.45  MULTISCREEN 96- well filter plate (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and filtrates analyzed for sugar content as described below. When not used immediately, filtered aliquots were frozen at -20C. The sugar concentrations of samples diluted in 0.005 M H2S04 were measured using a 4.6 x 250 mm AMINEX HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) by elution with 0.05% w/w benzoic acid-0.005 M H2S04 at 65C at a flow rate of 0.6 ml per minute, and quantitation by integration of the glucose, cellobiose, and xylose signals from refractive index detection (CHEMSTATION, AGILENT 1 100 HPLC, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) calibrated by pure sugar samples. The resultant glucose and cellobiose equivalents were used to calculate the percentage of cellulose conversion for each reaction. Glucose, cellobiose, and xylose were measured individually. Measured sugar concentrations were adjusted for the appropriate dilution factor. In case of unwashed PCS, the net concentrations of enzymatically-produced sugars were determined by adjusting the measured sugar concentrations for corresponding background sugar concentrations in unwashed PCS at zero time point. All HPLC data processing was performed using MICROSOFT EXCEL software (Microsoft, Richland, WA, USA).      The degree of cellulose conversion to glucose was calculated using the following equation:% conversion = glucose concentration / glucose concentration in a limit digest. To calculate total conversion the glucose and cellobiose values were combined. Cellobiose concentration was multiplied by 1 .053 in order to convert to glucose equivalents and added to the glucose concentration. The degree of total cellulose conversion was calculated using the following equation:      % conversion = [glucose concentration + 1 .053 x (cellobiose concentration)] / [(glucose concentration + 1.053 x (cellobiose concentration) in a limit digest].      The 1.053 factor for cellobiose takes into account the increase in mass when cellobiose is converted to glucose. In order to calculate% conversion, a 100% conversion point was set based on a cellulase control (50-100 mg of Trichoderma reesei cellulase per gram cellulose), and all values were divided by this number and then multiplied by 100. Triplicate data points were averaged and standard deviation was calculated.      Example 35: Evaluation of several cellulolytic proteins replacing CBHI, CBHII, and EGII components in a reconstituted Trichoderma reese/<'>-based enzyme composition for improved performance at 50C, 55C, and 60C      Several cellulolytic proteins were tested in various combinations at 50C, 55C, and 60C against a reconstituted Trichoderma reese/-based enzyme composition that included four major Trichoderma reesei cellulases (45% Trichoderma reesei Cel7A CBHI, 25% Trichoderma reesei Cel6A CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel5A EGII), a beta-glucosidase (10% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta- glucosidase), and a Family 61 polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity (10% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide).      The evaluated enzymes included Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI, Myceliophthora thermophila Cel7A CBHI, Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, and Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII. All enzyme compositions contained 45% CBHI, 25% CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% EGII, 10% Aspergillus fumigatus beta- glucosidase, and 10% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity. All enzyme compositions, including the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based composition, were applied at the same dosage of 5 mg protein per g cellulose. The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results as shown in Figure 1 demonstrated that the best enzyme composition for cellulose hydrolysis included Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI, Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, Aspergillus fumigatus beta-glucosidase, and Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity. Replacement of the Trichoderma reesei Cel7A CBHI, Cel6A CBHII, and Cel5A EGII with Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI, Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, and Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII significantly improved the degree of cellulose conversion to glucose at 60C (from 50% to 65%). The improved composition hydrolyzed milled washed PCS almost as efficiently at 60C (65% cellulose conversion to glucose) as the Trichoderma reese/-based composition at 50C (68%).      Example 36: Evaluation of GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity for the ability to enhance PCS-hydrolyzing activity of a high-temperature enzyme composition at 50C, 55C, and 60C      Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, prepared as described herein, were tested at 10% total protein addition for the ability to stimulate a high-temperature cellulase composition at 50C, 55C, and 60C using milled washed PCS. The compositions consisting of 45% Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 10% Aspergillus fumigatus beta-glucosidase, and 10% GH61 polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity were used for hydrolysis of milled washed PCS at 5 mg protein per g cellulose, and the results were compared with the results for a high-temperature enzyme composition without a GH61 polypeptide, which was used at 4.5 mg protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Figure 2 demonstrated that the Thermoascus aurantiacus     GH61 A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptides were able to significanty enhance PCS- hydrolyzing activity of the high-temperature enzyme composition at all temperatures from 50C to 60C, and that the stimulating effect was more pronounced at higher temperatures. At 60C, a composition without a GH61 polypeptide showed 48% conversion of cellulose to glucose. For comparison, compositions that included Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A or Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptides showed 70% and 68% conversion of cellulose to glucose, respectively.      Example 37: Evaluation of a binary composition of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity for the ability to enhance PCS-hydrolyzing activity of a high-temperature enzyme composition at 50C, 55C, and 60C      The boosting performance of a binary composition comprising equal amounts (on a protein basis) of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity was compared with the boosting performance of the individual GH61 proteins alone at equivalent total protein loading at 50C, 55C, and 60C. The high-temperature enzyme compositions included 45% Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 10% Aspergillus fumigatus beta-glucosidase, and 10% GH61 component (either an individual polypeptide or a binary composition). The total protein loading in hydrolysis reactions was 5 mg protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Figure 3 demonstrated that the binary combination of the two     GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity, Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E, provided greater enhancement than either of the GH61 proteins alone. The effect was especially pronounced at 60C. Example 38: Evaluation of binary compositions containing different ratios of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity for the ability to enhance PCS-hydrolyzing activity of a high-temperature enzyme composition at 60C      After determining that a 1 :1 composition of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity performed better in enhancing the PCS-hydrolyzing activity of a high-temperature enzyme composition than either protein alone, the effect was analyzed in more detail by examining different ratios of the Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptides. The various binary compositions of the GH61 polypeptides were added at 0.5 mg protein per g cellulose to a high-temperature enzyme composition (4.5 mg protein per g cellulose) so that the final mixture consisted of 45% Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGI I, 10% Penicillium brasilianum beta-glucosidase, and 10% GH61 component (either an individual GH61 polypeptide or a binary composition).      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 4. All binary compositions of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity provided significantly better enhancement of PCS hydrolysis by the high-temperature enzyme composition than either protein alone. The best performance was obtained for binary GH61 compositions that included at least 20% of either Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A or Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity.

The high-temperature enzyme composition contained 45% Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, and 10% Penicillium brasilianum Cel3A beta-glucosidase.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Figure 5 demonstrated that at equivalent protein loadings, the 1 :1 compositions of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity provided greater PCS hydrolysis enhancement than either of the GH61 proteins alone. The effect was especially pronounced at relatively high additions of the GH61 proteins. The effect saturated when the level of the GH61 binary composition reached approximately 20% of the total protein loading.      Example 40: Effect of Thermobifida fusca GH11 xylanase on saccharification of milled washed PCS by a high-temperature enzyme composition at 50-65C      The ability of Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 xylanase (0.5 mg protein per g cellulose) to stimulate saccharification of milled washed PCS by a high-temperature enzyme composition (5 mg protein per g cellulose) was examined at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C. For comparison, the high-temperature enzyme composition without a supplemental xylanase was tested at 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 mg protein per g cellulose. The high-temperature enzyme composition included 45% Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora t ermop ila Cel6A CBHII, 5% Tric oderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 10% Penicillium brasilianum Cel3A beta-glucosidase, and 10% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Figure 6 demonstrated that addition of Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 xylanase significantly improved performance of the high-temperature enzyme composition at all temperatures from 50C to 65C, increasing the cellulose conversion to glucose by 4-7% after 72 hours of hydrolysis.      Example 41 : Replacement of Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I in a high-temperature enzyme composition with various thermostable CBHI proteins at 50-65C      The ability of several thermostable CBHI proteins to replace Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI in a high-temperature enzyme composition (4 mg total protein per g cellulose) was tested at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C. The high-temperature enzyme composition included 45% Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHI I, 10% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, and 10% Penicillium brasilianum Cel3A beta-glucosidase.      The following recombinant CBHI cellulases from an Aspergillus oryzae expression host were tested as a replacement for Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI: Myceliophthora thermophila Cel7A, Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A, and Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel7A.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      As shown in Figure 7, the replacement of Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI with Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI gave the best hydrolysis results, providing an almost 6% improvement of the final hydrolysis yield at 60C. Surprisingly, a native Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel7A CBHI, which contained no CBM, also showed a remarkably good performance at elevated temperatures. Example 42: Comparison of high-temperature enzyme compositions containing Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI or Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI with Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase SaMe-MF268 (XCL-533) at 50C and 60C      Two high-temperature enzyme compositions that included either Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI or Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI were tested in comparison with Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition SaMe-MF268 (XCL-533) at four protein loadings (3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 mg protein per g cellulose) and two temperatures (50C and 60C) using milled washed PCS as a substrate The high- temperature enzyme compositions included 45% Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 7.5% Penicillium brasilianum GH3A beta-glucosidase, and 2.5% Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 xylanase. The Trichoderma reese/<'>-based enzyme composition SaMe-MF268 (XCL-533) was obtained as described in WO 2008/151079. The composition comprises a Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, a beta-glucosidase fusion protein comprising the Humicola insolens endoglucanase V core polypeptide fused to the wild-type Aspergillus oryzae beta-glucosidase, a Trichoderma reesei Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I, a Trichoderma reesei Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II, a Trichoderma reesei Cel7B endoglucanase I, a Trichoderma reesei Cel5A endoglucanase II, a Trichoderma reesei Cel45A endoglucanase V, and a Trichoderma reesei Cel12A endoglucanase III.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      Protein dose profiles for the Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI-based composition in comparison with the Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI-based composition and the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 are shown in Figure 8. The Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 showed poor performance at 60C, while both high-temperature enzyme compositions were significantly activated by the temperature increase from 50C to 60C. The high-temperature enzyme composition that included Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI performed at 60C as well as the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 performed at its optimum temperature of 50C, requiring approximately 3.5 mg protein per g cellulose to achieve 80% conversion of cellulose to glucose in 72 hours. For the Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI-based composition, the protein loading required to achieve the same degree of cellulose conversion at 60C was 4.5 mg protein per g cellulose.      Example 43: Hydrolysis time-course for Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI-based high-temperature enzyme composition in comparison with Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition SaMe-MF268 at 50C and 60C      Hydrolysis performance of the Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI-based high- temperature enzyme composition and the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition SaMe-MF268 (XCL-533) was compared over a longer incubation time (five days) at 50C and 60C using milled washed PCS as a substrate. The Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI- based enzyme composition included 45% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGI I, 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 7.5% Penicillium brasilianum GH3A beta-glucosidase, and 2.5% Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 xylanase. The Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI-based enzyme composition and the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 were tested at four different protein loadings, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mg protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The time-course hydrolysis results for one of the four tested protein loadings (2 mg protein per g cellulose) are shown in Figure 9. Similar trends were obtained for the three other protein loadings (data not shown). The Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 showed significantly reduced performance at 60C, while the Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI-based enzyme composition was significantly activated by the temperature increase from 50C to 60C.      Comparison of the Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI-based enzyme composition at     60C and the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 at 50C showed that the high-temperature composition performed better than the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 during the initial three days, and similarly to the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 during the last two days of hydrolysis. Comparison of the Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI-based enzyme composition and the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 at the same temperature of 50C showed slower but steadier rates of glucose accumulation for the high-temperature composition in comparison with the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL- 533, resulting in a better performance of the high-temperature composition in a long-term hydrolysis at 50C (5 days). Example 44: Evaluation of four xylanases for synergy with the Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBH l-based high-temperature enzyme composition at 50C, 55C, and 60C     Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 xylanase II, Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase, Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanase, and Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 xylanase were assayed for synergy with a high-temperature enzyme composition containing Cel7A CBHI from Aspergillus fumigatus at 50C, 55C, and 60C using milled washed PCS as a substrate. The xylanases were added at 10% (0.35 mg protein per g cellulose) to a constant loading of the high-temperature enzyme composition (3.5 mg protein per g cellulose). The high- temperature enzyme composition included 45% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGI I, 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, and 10% Penicillium brasilianum Cel3A beta-glucosidase.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Figure 10 demonstrated a considerable synergy between the xylanases and the high-temperature enzyme composition. At an equivalent protein loading (3.85 mg protein per g cellulose), all enzyme compositions that included xylanases achieved a significantly higher degree of cellulose conversion compared to the non-supplemented high-temperature enzyme composition. GH10 xylanases from Aspergillus fumigatus (xyn3) and Trichophaea saccata showed better performance than Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 xylanase II and Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 xylanase. The addition of the top two xylanases to the high-temperature enzyme composition resulted in an additional 1 1 -16% conversion of cellulose to glucose in 72 hours compared to the non-supplemented enzyme composition (3.85 mg protein per g cellulose).      Example 45: Evaluation of Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xylanase xyn3, Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanase, and Thermobifida fusca GH11 xylanase for synergy with a high-temperature enzyme composition at 60C      The ability of Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase, Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanase, and Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 xylanase to synergize with a high-temperature enzyme composition containing Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI was further examined by adding different levels of each xylanase (1.25%, 2.5%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) to a constant loading of the high-temperature enzyme composition (3 mg protein per g cellulose) at 60C using washed milled PCS as a substrate. The high-temperature enzyme composition included 45% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII , 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, and 10% Penicillium brasilianum Cel3A beta-glucosidase.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis. The results are shown in Figure 1 1.      Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 and Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanases performed similarly and showed better enhancement of PCS hydrolysis than Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 xylanase. The high-temperature enzyme composition supplemented with the GH10 xylanase from Aspergillus fumigatus or Trichophaea saccata significantly outperformed the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition SaMe-MF268 (XCL-533) after 72 hours of incubation with milled washed PCS. The optimal addition level was about 5% for the Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 and Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanases and about 10% for the Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 xylanase. As shown in Figure 1 1 , the addition of either Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 or Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanase to the high-temperature composition at a level of only 5% at 60C enhanced the cellulose conversion to glucose from 65% to 83%. An equivalent loading of the Trichoderma reesei- based cellulase composition XCL-533 (3.15 mg protein per g cellulose) yielded 73% conversion of cellulose to glucose at 50C.      Example 46: Comparison of Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A-based high-temperature enzyme composition containing Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase with Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase SaMe-MF268      A high-temperature enzyme composition containing Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase and the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition SaMe-MF268 (XCL- 533) were tested at three different protein loadings, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mg protein per g cellulose, and the protein loading profile of the high-temperature enzyme composition at 60C was compared with the protein loading profile of the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 at 50C. The high-temperature enzyme composition contained 45% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII , 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Penicillium brasilianum Cel3A beta-glucosidase, and 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 5% milled washed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis. The results are shown in Figure 12.      The experiment confirmed that the improved high-temperature enzyme composition containing Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase significantly surpassed the performance of the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533. At 60C, the high-temperature enzyme composition required a significantly lower protein loading (2.75 mg protein per g cellulose) than the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 at 50C (3.80 mg protein per g cellulose) to hydrolyze 80% of cellulose to glucose in 72 hours.      Example 47: Comparison of high-temperature enzyme compositions containing Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 or Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanase with Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase SaMe-MF268 in hydrolysis of washed and unwashed PCS      Protein loading profiles of the improved high-temperature enzyme compositions containing either GH10 xylanase from Aspergillus fumigatus (xyn 3) or GH10 xylanase from Trichophaea saccata were compared with protein loading profiles of the Trichoderma reese/<'>- based cellulase composition SaMe-MF268 (XCL-533) using milled washed and milled unwashed PCS. The high-temperature enzyme compositions included 45% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Penicillium brasilianum Cel3A beta-glucosidase, and 5% GH10 xylanase. The high-temperature enzyme compositions and the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 were tested at five different protein loadings, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 mg protein per g cellulose. All reactions with the high-temperature enzyme compositions were performed at 60C, while all reactions with the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 were performed at 50C.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled washed or milled unwashed PCS were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. Washed PCS was used at 5% total solids, whereas unwashed PCS was used at 5% insoluble solids. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results are shown in Table 2 and Figures 13A and 13B. The high-temperature enzyme compositions containing Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn 3 xylanase or Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanase showed similar performance, requiring similar protein loadings to achieve the same levels of cellulose conversion to glucose. The improved high-temperature enzyme compositions containing Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn 3 xylanase or Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanase outperformed the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based cellulase composition XCL-533 on both washed (A) and unwashed (B) PCS.      Table 2. Protein loadings required for reaching 80% cellulose conversion of washed and unwashed PCS (mg protein per g cellulose). Temperature: 60C for high-temperature enzyme compositions, 50C for XCL-533.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""065874491-imgf000283_0001"" />Example 48: Effect of Trichoderma reesei GH3 and Talaromyces emersonii GH3 beta- xylosidases on saccharification of milled unwashed PCS by a high-temperature enzyme composition at 60C      The ability of two beta-xylosidases, Trichoderma reesei GH3 beta-xylosidase and Talaromyces emersonii GH3 beta-xylosidase, to enhance hydrolysis of milled unwashed PCS by a high-temperature enzyme composition was evaluated at 60C as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis. The results are shown in Figures 14A and 14B.      The high-temperature enzyme composition included 45% Aspergillus fumigatus     Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase, and 5% Penicillium brasilianum Cel3A beta glucosidase. The high-temperature enzyme composition (3 mg total protein per g cellulose) was supplemented with Trichoderma reesei GH3 beta-xylosidase and Talaromyces emersonii GH3 beta-xylosidase at 1 %, 2%, 3.5%, 5%, and 10% replacement levels, and the hydrolysis results were compared with the results for the high-temperature enzyme composition containing no beta-xylosidase (0% replacement level).      As shown in Figure 14A, the inclusion of Trichoderma reesei GH3 beta-xylosidase and Talaromyces emersonii GH3 beta-xylosidase in the high-temperature enzyme composition increased the level of enzymatically-produced monomeric xylose from approximately 0.5 g/L (0% beta-xylosidase replacement) to approximately 2 g/L. The optimal replacement levels were 3.5% for Trichoderma reesei GH3 beta-xylosidase and 1-2% for Talaromyces emersonii GH3 beta-xylosidase. As shown in Figure 14B, the combined yield of glucose and cellobiose was increased by an additional 1.5% for a mixture containing 3.5% Trichoderma reesei GH3 beta-xylosidase and by an additional 2.5% for a mixture containing 2% Talaromyces emersonii GH3 beta-xylosidase.      These results demonstrated that both beta-xylosidases provided a small but significant benefit by increasing the degree of cellulose and hemicellulose conversion of milled unwashed PCS to soluble sugars (glucose, cellobiose and xylose). Talaromyces emersonii GH3 beta-xylosidase appeared to be slightly more active than Trichoderma reesei GH3 beta-xylosidase at 60C, increasing the monomeric xylose level by approximately 1 .5 g/L (Figure 14A) and the cellulose conversion by an additional 2.5% (Figure 14B) at a very low replacement level (1 -2%) of the high-temperature enzyme composition.      Example 49: Evaluation of four cellobiohydrolases I replacing a CBHI component in a high-temperature enzyme composition in saccharification of milled unwashed PCS at 50-65C      The ability of four cellobiohydrolase I proteins to replace a CBHI component in a high-temperature enzyme composition (3 mg total protein per g cellulose) was tested at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The high- temperature enzyme composition included 35% CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel5A EGII, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta-glucosidase, and 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase.      The following CBHI cellulases were tested in the high-temperature enzyme composition: Trichoderma reesei Cel7A CBHI, Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A CBHI, Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, and Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel7A CBHI.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      As shown in Figure 15, Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A performed better than other cellobiohydrolases I at all temperatures from 50C to 65C. Chaetomium thermophilum Cel7A also performed well in the entire range of temperatures, but the degree of cellulose conversion to glucose was lower compared to Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A. Trichoderma reesei Cel7A did not perform well at temperatures above 55C. Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel7A, which contained no CBM, showed a remarkably good performance at 60C and 65C, but was less efficient in hydrolyzing the cellulose in unwashed PCS at lower temperatures (50C and 55C).      Example 50: Evaluation of four cellobiohydrolases II replacing a CBHII component in a high-temperature enzyme composition in saccharification of milled unwashed PCS at 50-65C      The ability of several cellobiohydrolase II proteins to replace a CBHII component in a high-temperature enzyme composition (3 mg total protein per g cellulose) was tested at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The high- temperature enzyme composition included 35% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% CBHII, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel5A EGII, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta- glucosidase, and 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase.      The following CBHII cellulases were tested in the high-temperature enzyme composition: Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, Thielavia terrestris Cel6A CBHII, Aspergillus fumigatus Cel6A CBHII, and Trichophaea saccata Cel6A CBHII.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      As shown in Figure 16, CBHII from Aspergillus fumigatus performed about the same as CBHII from Myceliophthora thermophila at all temperatures, showing only a slightly lower hydrolysis at 60-65C. Thielavia terrestris Cel6A CBHII had high thermostability and performed well in the entire range of temperatures, but the degree of cellulose conversion to glucose was lower compared to Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII. Trichophaea saccata Cel6A CBHII had high activity at 50-55C, but did not perform well at higher temperatures.      Example 51 : Evaluation of two endoglucanases I replacing an endoglucanase component in a high-temperature enzyme composition in saccharification of milled unwashed PCS at 50-65C      The ability of two endoglucanase I proteins to replace an endoglucanase component in a high-temperature enzyme composition (3 mg total protein per g cellulose) was tested at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The high- temperature enzyme composition included 35% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 15% EG cellulase, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta-glucosidase, and 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase.      The following EGIs were tested in the high-temperature enzyme composition:     Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI and Aspergillus terreus Cel7 EGI.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      As shown in Figure 17, the high-temperature enzyme composition containing Aspergillus terreus Cel7 EGI performed significantly better than the high-temeperature enzyme composition containing Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI within this temperature range.      Example 52: Evaluation of three endoglucanases II replacing an endoglucanase component in a high-temperature enzyme composition in saccharification of milled unwashed PCS at 50-65C      The ability of three endoglucanase II proteins to replace an endoglucanase component in a high-temperature enzyme composition (3 mg total protein per g cellulose) was tested at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The high-temperature enzyme composition included 35% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 15% EG cellulase, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta-glucosidase, and 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase.      The following EGI Is were tested in the high-temperature enzyme composition: Trichoderma reesei Cel5A EGII, Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGI I , and Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel5A EGII.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis. As shown in Figure 18, all endoglucanase II proteins performed similarly within this temperature range, with Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII slightly outperforming Trichoderma reesei Cel5A EGII and Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel5A EGII. Example 53: Evaluation of three beta-glucosidases replacing a beta-glucosidase component in a high-temperature enzyme composition in saccharification of milled unwashed PCS at 50-65C      In a first experiment, three beta-glucosidases, including Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta-glucosidase, Penicillium brasilianum Cel3A beta-glucosidase, and Aspergillus niger Cel3 beta-glucosidase, were evaluated in a high-temperature enzyme composition at 50C, 55C, and 60C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The high-temperature enzyme composition included 45% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Thielavia terrestris Cel6A CBHII , 5% Trichoderma reesei Cel7B EGI, 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel5A EGII, 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase, and 5% beta-glucosidase. The high-temperature enzyme composition was used at 3.0 mg total protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Figure 19 demonstrated that all three beta-glucosidases performed about the same at 50C and 55C, whereas Aspergillus niger Cel3 beta- glucosidase showed slightly lower hydrolysis at 60C than the other two beta-glucosidases.      In a second experiment, Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta-glucosidase and     Penicillium brasilianum Cel3A beta-glucosidase were compared in a high-temperature enzyme composition at four temperatures, 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C, using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The high-temperature enzyme composition included 35% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel5A EGII, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% beta-glucosidase, and 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase. The high-temperature enzyme composition was used at 3.0 mg total protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis. The results shown in Figure 20 demonstrated that Cel3A beta-glucosidases from Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium brasilianum performed about the same within this temperature range. Example 54: Evaluation of six xylanases replacing a xylanase component in a high- temperature enzyme composition in saccharification of milled unwashed PCS at 50- 65C      The ability of six xylanases to replace a xylanase component in a high-temperature enzyme composition (3 mg total protein per g cellulose) was tested at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The high-temperature enzyme composition included 35% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel5A EGII, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta-glucosidase, and 5% xylanase.      The following xylanases were tested in the high-temperature enzyme composition:     Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 xyn II xylanase, Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3, Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanase, Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 xylanase, Penicillium pinophilum GH10 xylanase, and Thielavia terrestris GH10E xylanase.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      As shown in Figure 21 , GH10 xylanase from Penicillium pinophilum was superior to GH10 xylanases from Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophaea saccata at all temperatures from 50C to 65C. The Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 and Thielavia terrestris GH10E xylanases performed about the same as the Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 and Trichophaea saccata GH10 xylanases at 50C and 55C, but did not perform well at higher temperatures (60C and 65C). The Thermobifida fusca GH1 1 performed relatively well at 60C and 65C, but overall the degree of cellulose conversion to glucose was lower compared to other xylanases.      Example 55: Evaluation of the ability of four GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity to enhance PCS-hydrolyzing activity of a high-temperature enzyme composition at 50-65C using milled unwashed PCS      The ability of four GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity,     Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A, Thielavia terrestris GH61 E, Penicillium pinophilum GH61 , and Aspergillus fumigatus GH61 B, to enhance the PCS-hydrolyzing activity of a high-temperature enzyme composition was evaluated using milled unwashed PCS at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C. The high-temperature enzyme composition included 35% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus Cel5A EGII, 15% GH61 polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta-glucosidase, and 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase. The high-temperature enzyme composition was used at 3 mg total protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      As shown in Figure 22, all four GH61 polypeptides showed a significant cellulase- enhancing activity, with Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide being the most efficient enhancer among the four within this temperature range. High-temperature enzyme compositions containing Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptides performed better at higher temperatures (60C and 65C) than high- temperature enzyme compositions containing Penicillium pinophilum GH61 and Aspergillus fumigatus GH61 B polypeptides. Example 56: Evaluation of the ability of three GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity to enhance PCS-hydrolyzing activity of a high-temperature enzyme composition at 50-65C using milled unwashed PCS      The ability of three GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity, Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A, Thielavia terrestris GH61 N, and Penicillium sp GH61A, to enhance the PCS-hydrolyzing activity of a high-temperature enzyme composition was evaluated using milled unwashed PCS at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C. The high- temperature enzyme composition included 45% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 25% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 10% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 10% GH61 polypeptide, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta-glucosidase, and 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase. The results for the enzyme compositions containing GH61 polypeptides (3 mg total protein per g cellulose) were compared with the results for a similar enzyme composition to which no GH61 polypeptide was added (2.7 mg total protein per g cellulose).      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis. As shown in Figure 23, all three GH61 polypeptides showed a significant cellulase- enhancing activity, with Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide being the most efficient enhancer at 55-65C, and Thielavia terrestris GH61 N polypeptide slightly outperforming Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide at 50C. The high-temperature enzyme composition containing Penicillium sp. GH61A polypeptide performed almost as well as the high-temperature enzyme composition containing Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide at all four temperatures (50-65C). Thielavia terrestris GH61 N polypeptide performed well at 50C and 55C, but showed a significant decline in performance at higher temperatures (60C and 65C).      Example 57: Hydrolysis of milled unwashed PCS by Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL- 602 cellulase at different replacement levels by Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I, Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II, or their binary compositions at 50-60C      A Trichoderma reesei strain 981-08-D4-based cellulase containing Aspergillus fumigatus beta-glucosidase and Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide, designated Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase, was tested in 1-ml hydrolysis reactions at 50C, 55C, and 60C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The Trichoderma reese/<'>- based XCL-602 cellulase was used alone or in mixtures with Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI (10%, 20%, 30% or 40% of total protein), Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII (10% or 20% of total protein), or both Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII (10%/10%, 10%/20%, 20%/10%, 20%/20%, 30%/10%, 30%/20%, 40%/20% of total protein). The level of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide in all Trichoderma reesei XCL-602 compositions was maintained constant at 8% of total protein. Trichoderma reese/<'>-based enzyme composition SaMe-MF268 (XCL-533) was also included in the experiment. The non-replaced Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase and Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-533 cellulase and various Trichoderma reesei XCL-602 compositions containing Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and/or Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII were used at 3 mg total protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 50 mg of insoluble PCS solids per ml were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Figure 24 demonstrated that non-replaced Trichoderma reesei- based XCL-602 cellulase performed about the same as non-replaced Trichoderma reese/<'>- based XCL-533 cellulase at all three temperatures. At 50C and 55C, the replacement of 10%, 20%, or 30% protein in XCL-602 cellulase by Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI or the replacement of 10% or 20% protein in XCL-602 cellulase by Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII did not have a significant effect on the degree of cellulose conversion to glucose after 72 hours of hydrolysis. The replacement of 40% protein in the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase by Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI had a negative effect on the degree of cellulose conversion to glucose at 50C and 55C. At 60C, the replacement of protein in the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase by Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI (10-40% of total protein) or Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII (10-20% of total protein) significantly improved the hydrolysis over non-replaced Trichoderma reese/-based XCL-602 cellulase at an equivalent protein loading (3 mg protein per g cellulose). Higher replacement levels by Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI or Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII provided a greater hydrolysis enhancement over non-replaced XCL-602 cellulase at 60C.      For the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions that included both Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, the optimal replacement levels were 10-20% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI / 10-20% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII at 50C and 55C, and 40% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI / 20% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII at 60C.      Example 58: Hydrolysis of milled unwashed PCS by Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL- 602 cellulase containing Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I and Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II, and additionally supplemented by Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn 3 and/or Thielavia terrestris GH61 E at 50-60C      The Trichoderma reese/-based XCL-602 cellulase containing Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A cellobiohydrolase I and Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A cellobiohydrolase II was tested in 1 -ml hydrolysis reactions at 50C, 55C and 60C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase was used alone (3.0 mg protein per g cellulose) or with replacement by different binary compositions consisting of Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII (10%/10% or 40%/20% of total protein) to a total protein loading of 3 mg protein per g cellulose. The level of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide in all Trichoderma reesei XCL-602- based compositions containing Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII was maintained constant at 8% of total protein. The Trichoderma reesei XCL-602-based compositions containing Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII (3 mg protein per g cellulose) were additionally supplemented with 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn 3 xylanase (0.15 mg protein per g cellulose), 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide (0.15 mg protein per g cellulose), or with a binary composition consisting of 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn 3 xylanase and 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide (0.30 mg protein per g cellulose). For comparison, the non-replaced Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase was used alone at 3.15 mg protein per g cellulose and 3.3 mg protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 50 mg of insoluble PCS solids per ml were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Figures 25A and 25B demonstrated that the addition of 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase and/or 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide to the Trichoderma reesei XCL-602-based compositions containing Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII significantly improved the hydrolysis performance at all three temperatures, with a very large improvement obtained when both the Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase and the Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide were added together. The best XCL-602-based composition in this experiment (XCL-602 with 10% replacement by Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and 10% replacement by Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, and with additional supplementation by 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase and 5% Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide) required 3.3 mg protein per g cellulose to achieve 82% conversion of cellulose to glucose in milled unwashed PCS after 72 hours of hydrolysis at 55C. This represents a 1.5X reduction in protein loading compared to Trichoderma reesei XCL-533 (SaMe-MF268), which required 4.9 mg protein per g cellulose to achieve 80% conversion of cellulose to glucose in milled unwashed PCS after 72 hours of hydrolysis at 50C (Table 2).      Exaple 59: Hydrolysis of milled unwashed PCS by Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions containing different replacement levels of Trichoderma reesei- based XCL-592 cellulase at 50-60C      The Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase was tested alone (3.0 mg protein per g cellulose) or in mixtures with Trichoderma reesei RutC30-based cellulase containing Aspergillus aculeatus GH10 xylanase, designated as Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-592 cellulase. The Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-592 cellulase replaced 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25% of protein in the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase to a total protein loading of 3 mg protein per g cellulose. The non-replaced Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL- 602 cellulase and XCL-602-based enzyme compositions were tested in 1 -ml hydrolysis reactions at 50C, 55C and 60C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. For comparison, Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-533 cellulase was tested at 4.5 mg protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 50 mg of insoluble PCS solids per ml were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Figure 26 demonstrated that the optimal replacement level of Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase by Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-592 cellulase at 50C and 55C was between 10% and 15% of total protein. At 50C and 55C, the best Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions performed significantly better than Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase alone at an equivalent protein loading (3 mg protein per g cellulose), but were not able to reach the performance level obtained with Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-533 cellulase at 4.5 mg protein per g cellulose.      Example 60: Comparison of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity replacing 5% of protein in Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase or XCL-602-based enzyme composition in hydrolysis of milled unwashed PCS at 50-60C      The Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase was tested alone and with 5% replacement by Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity or Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity at 50- 60C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. In addition, the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase composition containing 30% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI , 20% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHI, I and 5% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide was tested in comparison with a similar composition containing Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide instead of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide. All compositions were tested at 3 mg protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 50 mg of insoluble PCS solids per ml were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      As shown in Figure 27A, replacement of 5% protein in Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase by Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide did not provide an advantage over the equivalent replacement by Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide. Similarly, as shown in Figure 27B, the replacement of 5% protein in Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL- 602 cellulase by Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide along with the 30% replacement by Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and 20% replacement by Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, did not provide an advantage over the equivalent replacement by Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide. Each GH61 polypeptide was tested at six different replacement levels ranging from 5% to 20%, and the conclusion was consistent for all replacement levels (data not shown). The results indicated that the Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptide did not synergize with the Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide under these conditions.      Example 61 : Comparison of XCL-602-based enzyme compositions containing different replacement levels of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A or Thielavia terrestris GH61 E GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity in hydrolysis of milled unwashed PCS at 50-60C      Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity were tested separately at six different replacement levels (5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%, and 20%) in different Trichoderma reesei- based XCL-602 cellulase compositions at 50-60C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. In one case, the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions comprised different replacement levels of a GH61 polypeptide along with a 5% replacement by Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase. In another case, Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions comprised different replacement levels of a GH61 polypeptide along with a 30% replacement by Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, a 20% replacement by Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, and a 5% replacement by Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase. All enzyme compositions were tested at 3 mg total protein per g cellulose. For comparison, Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-533 cellulase was tested at 4.5 mg protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 50 mg of insoluble PCS solids per ml were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Table 3 demonstrated that the optimal replacement level for both GH61 polypeptides at 50C and 55C was 10-12.5% of the total protein in the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions. At 60C, the optimal replacement level for both GH61 polypeptides was 20% of the total protein in the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions. The equivalent replacement levels of the Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A and Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptides in similar Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions provided a similar enhancement of the cellulose hydrolysis in milled unwashed PCS at 50-60C.      Table 3. Comparison of Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions containing different replacement levels of Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A or Thielavia terrestris GH61 E polypeptides in hydrolysis of milled unwashed PCS at 50-60C.     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""065874491-imgf000295_0001"" />GH61 replacement level 50C 55C 60C      15% T terrestris GH61 E 66% 74% 69%      20% T terrestris GH61 E 65% 72% 69%      Example 62: Hydrolysis of milled unwashed PCS by non-replaced XCL-602 and various XCL-602-based enzyme compositions (3 mg protein per g cellulose) in comparison with Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-533 cellulase (4.5 mg protein per g cellulose) at 50-60C      Example 61 was repeated using the same Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions except that only one GH61 polypeptide (Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A) was tested at a single replacement level (10% of total protein). The Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase and all Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase compositions were used at 3 mg total protein per g cellulose.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with 50 mg of insoluble PCS solids per ml were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      The results shown in Figure 28A demonstrated that the replacement of Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase with a composition comprising 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase and 10% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide to a total protein loading of 3 mg protein per g cellulose has significantly improved the hydrolysis yield over the non-replaced Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase at all three temperatures. As shown in Figure 27B, the enhancement was even more pronounced when the Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase was additionally replaced with 30% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and 20% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII. The results shown in Figure 28B demonstrated that the replacement of Trichoderma reese/<'>- based XCL-602 cellulase with 30% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and 20% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII increased the degree of cellulose conversion to glucose after 72 hours of hydrolysis at 60C from 37% to 48%. Additional 5% replacement by Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase increased the degree of cellulose conversion to glucose to 58%, and additional 10% replacement by Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide increased the degree of cellulose conversion to glucose to 68% compared to 37% obtained with non-replaced Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase. At 3 mg protein per g cellulose, the best XCL-602-based enzyme composition comprising the XCL- 602 cellulase with 30% replacement by Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI, 20% replacement by Myceliophthora thermophila Cel6A CBHII, 5% replacement by Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase and 10% replacement by Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide, was capable of achieving the same cellulose conversion of milled unwashed PCS at 55C (76%) as non-replaced Trichoderma reese/<'>-based XCL-602 cellulase at 4.5 mg protein per g cellulose and 50C - a 1.5-fold reduction in protein loading.      Example 63: Preparation of Penicillium emersonii strain NN051602 GH7 cellobiohydrolase I      The Penicillium emersonii strain NN051602 Cel7 cellobiohydrolase I (SEQ ID NO: 157 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 158 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      Penicillium emersonii was grown on a PDA agar plate at 45C for 3 days. Mycelia were collected directly from the agar plate into a sterilized mortar and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder, and genomic DNA was isolated using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).      Oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the GH7 cellobiohydrolase I gene from genomic DNA of Penicillium emersonii. An IN-FUSION CF Dry-down Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pPFJ0355, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      Sense primer:      5'-ACACAACTGGGGATCCACC atgcttcgacgggctcttc-3' (SEQ ID NO: 207)      Antisense primer:      5'-GTCACCCTCTAGATCT CGCAG AG C AACTTCCGTCTACTTC-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 208) Bold letters represented the coding sequence (for the sense primer) or the downstream sequence of the coding region (for the antisense primer). The remaining sequence was homologous to the insertion sites of pPFJ0355.      Twenty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of Penicillium emersonii genomic DNA, 10  I of 5X GC Buffer, 1.5  of DMSO, 2.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 0.6 unit of Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed using a Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed for denaturing at 98C for 1 minute; 8 cycles of denaturing at 98C for 15 seconds, annealing at 65C for 30 seconds, with 1 C decrease per cycle and elongation at 72C for 80 seconds; and another 23 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 66C for 30 seconds and 72C for 75 seconds; final extension at 72C for 7 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1 .0% agarose gel electrophoresis using 90mM Tris-borate and 1 mM EDTA (TBE) buffer where an approximately 1.4 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      Plasmid pPFJ0355 was digested with Bam I and Bgl II, isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together using an INFUSION CF Dry-down PCR Cloning resulting in pGH7_ZY209383 in which transcription of the Penicillium emersonii GH7 cellobiohydrolase I gene was under the control of the Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase promoter from the gene for Aspergillus oryzae alpha- amylase. The cloning operation was according to the manufacturer's instruction. In brief, 30 ng of pPFJ0355 digested with Bam I and Bgl II, and 60 ng of the Penicillium emersonii GH7 cellobiohydrolase I gene purified PCR product were added to the reaction vial and resuspended the powder in a final volume of 10ul with addition of deionized water. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes and then 50C for 15 minutes. Five  of the reaction were used to transform E. coli TOP10 competent cells. An E. coli transformant containing pGH7_ZY209383 was detected by colony PCR and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The Penicillium emersonii GH7 cellobiohydrolase I gene insert in pGH7_ZY209383 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer.      Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 (WO 95/35385) protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422 and transformed with 3 g of pGH7_ZY209383. The transformation yielded about 50 transformants. Twelve transformants were isolated to individual Minimal medium plates.      Four transformants were inoculated separately into 3 ml of YPM medium in a 24-well plate and incubated at 30C, 150 rpm. After 3 days incubation, 20  of supernatant from each culture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting gel was stained with INSTANT Blue. SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the majority of the transformants had a major smeary band of approximately 50 kDa. The expression strain was designated as A. oryzae EXP03477.      A slant of A. oryzae EXP03477 was washed with 10 ml of YPM medium and inoculated into a 2 liter flask containing 400 ml of YPM medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The culture was harvested on day 3 and filtered using a 0.45  DURAPORE Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).      A 1600 ml volume of filtered broth of A. oryzae EXP03477 was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation), re-dissolved in 100 ml of 25 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5 buffer, dialyzed against the same buffer, and filtered through a 0.45  filter; the final volume was 200 ml. The solution was applied to a 40 ml Q Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with 25 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5, and the proteins were eluted with a linear NaCI gradient (0-0.4 M). Fractions with activity against PASC were collected and applied to a 40 ml Phenyl Sepharose HIC column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated in 20 mM PBS with 1 .8 M (NH4)2S04 pH 7 buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 20 mM PBS pH 7. Fractions from the column with activity toward phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) as substrate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer. Fractions with the correct molecular weight were pooled. Then the pooled solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 64: Preparation of Penicillium pinophilium strain NN046877 GH7 cellobiohydrolase I      The Penicillium pinophilium strain NN046877 Cel7 cellobiohydrolase II (SEQ ID NO:     159 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 160 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      Penicillium pinophilum was grown on a PDA agar plate at 37C for 4-5 days. Mycelia were collected directly from the agar plate into a sterilized mortar and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder, and genomic     DNA was isolated using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit.      Oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the GH7 cellobiohydrolase I gene from the genomic DNA of Penicillium pinophilum. An IN-FUSION     CF Dry-down Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pPFJ0355, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      Sense primer:      5 '- AC AC AACTG G G G ATCC AC CAT GT CTG C CTTG AACT CTTT C-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 209) Antisense primer:      5'-GTCACCCTCTAGATCTTCACAAACATTGAGAGTAGTAAGGGTT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 210) Bold letters represented the coding sequence and the remaining sequence was homologous to the insertion sites of pPFJ0355.      Twenty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of Penicillium pinophilum genomic DNA, 10  I of 5X GC Buffer, 1.5  of DMSO, 2.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 0.6 unit of Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed using a Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed for denaturing at 98C for 1 minute; 5 cycles of denaturing at 98C for 15 seconds, annealing at 56C for 30 seconds, with 1 C increasing per cycle and elongation at 72C for 75 seconds; and another 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 65C for 30 seconds and 72C for 75 seconds; final extension at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using     90mM Tris-borate and 1 mM EDTA (TBE) buffer where an approximately 1.6kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      Plasmid pPFJ0355 was digested with Bam I and Bgl II, isolated by 1 .0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together using an INFUSION CF Dry-down PCR Cloning resulting in pPpin6 in which transcription of the Penicillium pinophilum GH7 cellobiohydrolase I gene was under the control of the Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase promoter. In brief, 30 ng of pPFJ0355 digested with Bam I and Bgl II, and 100 ng of the Penicillium pinophilum GH7 cellobiohydrolase I gene purified PCR product were added to a reaction vial and resuspended in a final volume of 10  with addition of deionized water. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes and then 50C for 15 minutes. Three  of the reaction were used to transform E. coli TOP10 competent cells. An E. coli transformant containing pPpin6 was detected by colony PCR and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The Penicillium pinophilum GH7 cellobiohydrolase I gene insert in pPpin6 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer.      Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 (WO 95/35385) protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422 and transformed with 3 g of pPpin6. The transformation yielded about 50 transformants. Four transformants were isolated to individual Minimal medium plates.      Four transformants were inoculated separately into 3 ml of YPM medium in a 24-well plate and incubated at 30C, 150 rpm. After 3 days incubation, 20  of supernatant from each culture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting gel was stained with INSTANT Blue. SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the majority of the transformants had a major smear band of approximately 60-90 kDa. The expression strain was designated as A. oryzae EXP02768.      A slant of A. oryzae EXP02768 was washed with 10 ml of YPM medium and inoculated into a 2 liter flask containing 400 ml of YPM medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The culture was harvested on day 3 and filtered using a 0.45  DURAPORE Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).      A 1600 ml volume of the filtered broth of A. oryzae EXP02768 was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation), re-dissolved in 100 ml of 25 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, dialyzed against the same buffer, and filtered through a 0.45  filter; the final volume was 200 ml. The solution was applied to a 40 ml Q Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated in 25 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, and the proteins were eluted with a linear NaCI gradient (0-0.4 M). Fractions from the column with activity against --D-lactopyranoside were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer. Fractions with the correct molecular weight were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.

A 1.7 kb PCR reaction product was isolated by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using     TAE buffer and staining with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). The DNA band was visualized with the aid of an Eagle Eye Imaging System and a DarkReader Transilluminator (Clare Chemical Research, Dolores, CO, USA). The 1 .7 kb DNA band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The 1.7 kb fragment was cleaved with EcoR I and Not I and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The expression plasmid pXYG1051-NP003568 was transformed into Aspergillus oryzae JaL355 as described in WO 98/00529. Transformants were purified on selection plates through single conidia prior to sporulating them on PDA plates. Production of the Aspergillus terreus GH7 polypeptide by the transformants was analyzed from culture supernatants of 1 ml 96 deep well stationary cultivations at 26C in YP medium with 2% maltodextrin. Expression was verified by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer and Coomassie blue staining. One transformant was selected for further work and designated Aspergillus oryzae 64.1.      For larger scale production, Aspergillus oryzae 64.1 spores were spread onto a PDA plate and incubated for five days at 37C. The confluent spore plate was washed twice with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 to maximize the number of spores collected. The spore suspension was then used to inoculate twenty-five 500 ml flasks containing 100 ml of YPG medium. The culture was incubated at 30C with constant shaking at 120 rpm. At day four post-inoculation, the culture broth was collected by filtration through a triple layer of Whatman glass microfiber filters of 1.6 , 1.2 , and 0.7 . Fresh culture broth from this transformant produced a band of GH7 protein of approximately 55 kDa. The identity of this band as the Aspergillus terreus GH7 polypeptide was verified by peptide sequencing.      Two liters of the filtered broth were concentrated to 400 ml and washed with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0 using a SARTOFLOW Alpha ultrafiltration system with a 10 kDa MW-CO (Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A., Aubagne Cedex, France).

Example 68: Preparation of a Fennellia nivea strain NN046949 GH6 cellobiohydrolase II The Fennellia nivea strain NN046949 GH6 cellobiohydrolase II (SEQ ID NO: 167 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 168 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      Fennellia nivea strain NN046949 was isolated from a soil from Yunnan, China by directly plating the soil sample onto a PDA plate followed by incubation at 37C for 5 days. The strain was then purified by transferring the mycelia onto a YG agar plate. The Fennellia nivea strain NN046949 was identified as Fennellia nivea based on both morphological and molecular (ITS sequencing) characterization.      Fennellia nivea strain NN046949 was inoculated onto a PDA plate and incubated for 4 days at 37C in the darkness. Several mycelia-PDA plugs were inoculated into 500 ml shake flasks containing 100 ml of NNCYP-PCS medium. The flasks were incubated for 6 days at 37C with shaking at 160 rpm. The mycelia were collected at 4, 5, and 6 days, and each frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a -80C freezer until use.      The frozen F. nivea mycelia were mixed and transferred into a liquid nitrogen prechilled mortar and pestle and ground to a fine powder. Total RNA was prepared from the powdered mycelia of each day by extraction with TRIZOL reagent and purified using a RNEASY Plant Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The polyA enriched RNA was isolated using a mTRAP Total Kit. Eighty-seven gs of total RNA was submitted for sequencing as described in Example 3.      Total RNA enriched for polyA sequences with the mRNASeq protocol were sequenced using an ILLUMINA GA2 System (lllumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The raw 75 base pair reads were assembled and the assembled sequences were analyzed using standard bioinformatics methods for gene finding and functional prediction. Briefly, ESTscan 2.0 was used for gene prediction. NCBI blastall version 2.2.10 and HMMER version 2.1 .1 were used to predict function based on structural homology. The Family GH6 cellobiohydrolase was identified directly by analysis of the Blast results.      Fennellia nivea strain NN046949 was grown on PDA agar plate at 37C for 3 days. Mycelia were collected directly from the agar plate into a sterilized motar and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder, and genomic DNA was isolated using a DNEASY Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).      Based on the F. nivea GH6 cellobiohydrolase gene sequence obtained in Example 3, oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the gene from genomic DNA of Fennellia nivea. An IN-FUSION CF Dry-down PCR Cloning Kit was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pPFJ0355, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      Sense primer: 5'-ACACAACTGGGGATCCACCATGGGACGGGTTTCTTCTCTTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 217) Antisense primer:      5'-GTCACCCTCTAGATCTAAGAACACCCCGCAAAGAAAGTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 218) Bold letters represent the coding sequence for the sense primer or the reverse compliment sequence downstream of the stop codon for the antisense primer. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pPFJ0355.      Twenty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of Fennellia nivea genomic DNA, 10  of 5X GC Buffer, 1.5  of DMSO, 2  of 2.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 1 unit of Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase in a final volume of 50 .

The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer where an approximately 1.8 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      Plasmid pPFJ0355 was digested with Bam I and Bgl II, isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together using an IN-FUSION Dry Down PCR Cloning Kit resulting in pCBHII46949-2 in which transcription of the Fennellia nivea GH6 cellobiohydrolase gene was under the control of the Aspergillus oryzae TAKA alpha-amylase promoter. In brief, 30 ng of pPFJ0355 digested with Bam I and Bgl II, and 50 ng of the F. nivea GH6 cellobiohydrolase gene purified PCR product were added to a reaction vial and resuspended in a final volume of 10  I with addition of deionized water. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes and then 50C for 15 minutes. Three  of the reaction were used to transform  coli TOP10 competent cells. An . coli transformant containing pCBHII46949-2 was detected by colony PCR and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The F. nivea GH6 cellobiohydrolase gene insert in pCBHII46949-2 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer.      The same gene fragment was then incubated in 10X Taq DNA polymerase mix     (TIANGEN Biotech (Beijing) Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) at 72C for 20 minutes to add adenine to the 3' end of each nucleotide strand. Then the gene fragment was ligated to pGEM-T vector using a pGEM-T Vector System to generate pGEM-T-CBHII46949-2. The Fennellia nivea cellobiohydrolase gene insert in pGEM-T-CBHII46949-2 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer. E. coli strain T-CBHII46949-2, containing pGEM- T-CBHII46949-2, was deposited on October 28, 2010 with the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ), Mascheroder Weg 1 B, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany assigned the accession number DSM 24143.      Nucleotide sequence data were scrutinized for quality and all sequences were compared to each other with assistance of PHRED/PHRAP software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA).      The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the F. nivea cellobiohydrolase gene are shown in SEQ ID NO: 167 and SEQ ID NO: 168, respectively. The genomic fragment encodes a polypeptide of 469 amino acids, interrupted by 7 predicted introns of 49 bp (nucleotides 77-125), 247 bp (nucleotides 195-241 ), 46 bp (nucleotides 570- 615), 55 bp (nucleotides 870-924), 50 bp (nucleotides 1063-1 1 12), 46 bp (nucleotides 1371 - 1416), and 49 bp (nucleotides 1659-1707). The% G+C content of the full-length coding sequence and the mature coding sequence are 57.65% and 60.24%, respectively. Using the SignalP software program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1 -6), a signal peptide of 18 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 451 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 48.77 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.17. Amino acids 1 12 to 469 are indicative of a Family 6 glycosyl hydrolase. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, the cellobiohydrolase appears to fall into the cellobiohydrolase Family GH6 according to Coutinho and Henrissat, 1999, supra. Amino acids 22 to 50 are indicative of a CBM domain and amino acids 58 to 1 1 1 a linker region.      Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 (WO 95/35385) protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422 and transformed with 3 g of pCBHII46949-2. The transformation yielded about 50 transformants. Four transformants were isolated to individual Minimal medium plates.      Four transformants were inoculated separately into 3 ml of YPM medium in 24-well plate and incubated at 30C, 150 rpm. After 3 days incubation, 20  of supernatant from each culture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting gel was stained with INSTANTBLUE (Expedeon Ltd., Babraham Cambridge, UK). SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the majority of the transformants had a band of approximately 60 kDa. One transformant was chosen as the expression strain and designated Aspergillus oryzae EXP03324.      A slant of Aspergillus oryzae EXP03324 was washed with 10 ml of YPM medium and inoculated into 4 2-liter flasks, containing 400 ml of YPM medium for each, to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The culture was harvested on day 3 by filtering the culture against MIRACLOTH (CALBIOCHEM, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA). The filtered culture broth was then again filtered using a 0.45  DURAPORE Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).      A 1600 ml volume of the Aspergillus oryzae EXP03324 filtered broth was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation), re-dissolved in 100 ml 25 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5 buffer, dialyzed against the same buffer, and filtered through a 0.45  filter; the final volume was 200 ml. The solution was applied to a 40 ml Q Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated in 25 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5 buffer and the proteins were eluted with a linear 0-0.4 M NaCI gradient. Fractions from the column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer. Fractions with a molecular weight of 60 kDa were pooled. Then the pooled solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration and assayed for cellobiohydrolase activity using phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) as substrate. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      A PASC stock slurry solution was prepared by moistening 5 g of AVICEL (JRS Pharma GmbH & Co., Rosenberg, Germany) with water, followed by the addition of 150 ml of ice cold 85% o-phosphoric acid. The suspension was slowly stirred in an ice-bath for 1 hour. Then 500 ml of ice cold acetone were added while stirring. The slurry was filtered using MIRACLOTH and then washed three times with 100 ml of ice-cold acetone (drained as dry as possible after each wash). Finally, the filtered slurry was washed twice with 500 ml of water, and again drained as dry as possible after each wash. The PASC was mixed with deionized water to a total volume of 500 ml to a concentration of 10 g/liter, blended to homogeneity using an ULTRA-TURRAX Homogenizer (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA), and stored in a refrigerator for up to one month.      The PASC stock solution was diluted with 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer to a concentration of 2 g/liter, and used as the substrate. To 150  of PASC stock solution, 20  of enzyme sample were added and the reaction mixture was incubated for 60 minutes with shaking at 850 rpm. At the end of the incubation, 50  of 2% NaOH were added to stop the reaction. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 1 ,000 x g. The released sugars were measured by first mixing 10  I of the reaction mixture with 90  of 0.4% NaOH, followed by 50  of 1 .5% p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide in 2% NaOH (PHBAH, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Loius, MO, USA). The mixture was boiled at 100C for 5 minutes, and then 100  were transferred to a microtiter plate for an absorbance reading at 410 nm using a Spectra Max M2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Blanks were made by omitting PASC in the hydrolysis step, and by replacing the hydrolysate with buffer in the sugar determination step.      The assay results demonstrated that the purified enzyme possessed cellobiohydrolase activity.      Example 69: Preparation of Penicillium emersonii strain NN051602 GH6A cellobiohydrolase II      Penicillium emersonii strain NN051602 GH6A cellobiohydrolase II (SEQ ID NO: 169     [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 170 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      Penicillium emersonii was grown on a PDA agar plate at 45C for 3 days. Mycelia were collected directly from the agar plate into a sterilized mortar and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder, and genomic DNA was isolated using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).      Oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the GH6 cellobiohydrolase II gene from genomic DNA of Penicillium emersonii. An IN-FUSION CF Dry-down Cloning Kit was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pPFJ0355, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      Sense primer:      5'-ACACAACTGGGGATCCACCATGCGGAATCTTCTTGCTCTTGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 219) Antisense primer:      5'-GTCACCCTCTAGATCTCTAGAACAGCGGGTTAGCATTCGTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 220) Bold letters represented the coding sequence. The remaining sequence was homologous to the insertion sites of pPFJ0355.      Twenty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of Penicillium emersonii genomic DNA, 10  I of 5X HF Buffer, 1 .5  of DMSO, 5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 0.6 unit of Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed using a Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed for denaturing at 98C for 1 minutes; 8 cycles of denaturing at 98C for 15 seconds, annealing at 66C for 30 seconds, with a 1 C decrease per cycle and elongation at 72C for 70 seconds; and another 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 62C for 30 seconds and 72C for 80 seconds; final extension at 72C for 5 minutes.

In brief, 30 ng of pPFJ0355, digested with Bam I and Bgl II, and 60 ng of the Penicillium emersonii GH6 cellobiohydrolase II gene purified PCR product were added to a reaction vial and resuspended in a final volume of 10  with addition of deionized water. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes and then 50C for 15 minutes. Three  of the reaction were used to transform E. coli TOP10 competent cells. An E. coli transformant containing pCBHII51602 was detected by colony PCR and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).

The transformation yielded about 50 transformants. Twelve transformants were isolated to individual Minimal medium plates.      Six transformants were inoculated separately into 3 ml of YPM medium in 24-well plate and incubated at 30C, 150 rpm. After 3 days incubation, 20  of supernatant from each culture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting gel was stained with INSTANT Blue. SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the majority of the transformants had a major smeary band of approximately 62 kDa. The expression strain was designated as A. oryzae EXP03259.      A slant of A. oryzae EXP03259 was washed with 10 ml of YPM medium and inoculated into a 2 liter flask containing 400 ml of YPM medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The culture was harvested on day 3 and filtered using a 0.45  DURAPORE Membrane.      A 1600 ml volume of filtered broth of A. oryzae EXP03259 was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation), re-dissolved in 100 ml 2of 5 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, dialyzed against the same buffer, and filtered through a 0.45  filter; the final volume was 200 ml. The solution was applied to a 40 ml Q Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with 25 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, and the proteins were eluted with a linear NaCI gradient (0-0.4 M). Fractions from the column with activity against PASC were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer. Fractions with the correct molecular weight were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Example 70: Preparation of Penicillium pinophilum strain NN046877 GH6A cellobiohydrolase II      The Penicillium pinophilum strain NN046877 GH6A cellobiohydrolase II (SEQ ID NO: 171 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 172 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.

Example 71 : Preparation of Aspergillus fumigatus strain NN051616 GH5 endoglucanase II      The Aspergillus fumigatus strain NN051616 GH5 endoglucanase II (SEQ ID NO: 173     [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 174 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below were designed to PCR amplify the Aspergillus fumigatus Family GH5 gene from the genomic DNA. An IN-FUSION Cloning Kit was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector, pAILo2 (WO 2005/074647), without the need for restriction digests and ligation.      Forward primer:      5'-ACTGGATTTACCATGAAATTCGGTAGCATTGTGCTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 223)      Reverse primer:      5'-TCACCTCTAGTTAATTAATCAACCCAGGTAGGGCTCCAAGATG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 224) Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pAILo2.      Fifteen picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing 200 ng of Aspergillus fumigatus genomic DNA, 1X Pfx Amplification Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1 mM MgS04, 1 .5  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 2.5 units of Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), in a final volume of 50 . The amplification conditions were one cycle at 98C for 3 minutes; and 30 cycles each at 98C for 30 seconds, 57C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 75 seconds. The heat block was then held at 72C for 15 minutes followed by a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated on a 1.0% agarose gel using TAE buffer and a     2.4 kb product band was excised from the gel and purified using a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The fragment was then cloned into pAILo2 using an IN-FUSION Cloning Kit. The vector was digested with Nco I and Pac I. The fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and a QIAquick Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The gene fragment and the digested vector were combined together in a reaction resulting in the expression plasmid pAG10, in which transcription of the Aspergillus fumigatus Family GH5 gene was under the control of the NA2-tpi promoter (a hybrid of the promoters from the genes for Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase and Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase). The recombination reaction (20 ) was composed of 1X I IN-FUSION Buffer (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) , 1X BSA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) , 1  of IN-FUSION enzyme (diluted 1 :10) (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) , 180 ng of pAILo2 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 80 ng of the Aspergillus fumigatus beta-xylosidase purified PCR product. The reaction was incubated at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The reaction was diluted with 40  of TE buffer and 2.5  of the diluted reaction was used to transform E. coli SOLOPACK Gold cells. An E. coli transformant containing pAG10 (Aspergillus fumigatus Family GH5 gene) was identified by restriction enzyme digestion and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAGEN BioRobot 9600. The pAG10 plasmid construct was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 3130x1 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to verify the sequence.      Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of     Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422 and transformed with 5 g of pAG10. Three transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates.      Plugs taken from the original transformation plate of each of the three transformants were added to 1 ml of M410 medium separately in 24 well plates, which were incubated at 34C. After five days of incubation, 7.5  of supernatant from each culture was analyzed using CRITERION stain-free, 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE, (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the transformants had a new major band of approximately 35 kDa.      Confluent PDA plate of the highest expressing transformant was washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and inoculated into three 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 100 ml of M410 medium. Inoculated flasks were incubated with shaking for 3 days at 34C. The broths were pooled and filtered through a 0.22  stericup suction filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).      A 35 ml volume of filtered broth was buffer exchanged into 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 using a 400 ml Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 72: Preparation of Neosartorya fischeri strain NRRL 181 GH5 endoglucanase II      The Neosartorya fischeri NRRL 181 GH5 endoglucanase II (SEQ ID NO: 175 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 176 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to PCR amplify the endoglucanase gene from Neosartorya fischeri NRRL 181 genomic DNA. Genomic DNA was isolated using a FastDNA spin for Soil Kit. Primer #350:      5'-TAAGAATTCACCATGAAGGCTTCGACTATTATCTGTGCA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 225)      Primer#358:      5'-TATGCGGCCGCACGGCAATCCAAGTCATTCAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 226)      The amplification reaction was composed of 1  of Neosartorya fischeri genomic     DNA, 12.5  of 2X REDDYMIX PCR Buffer, 1  of 5  primer #374, 1  of 5  primer #375, and 9.5  of H20. The amplification reaction was incubated in a PTC-200 DNA ENGINE Thermal Cycler programmed for 1 cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; and 35 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds and 60C for 1.5 minutes.      A 1 .4 kb PCR reaction product was isolated by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using     TAE buffer and staining with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain. The DNA band was visualized with the aid of an Eagle Eye Imaging System and a DarkReader Transilluminator. The 1.4 kb DNA band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The 1.4 kb fragment was cleaved with EcoR I and Not I and purified using a GFX     PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The cleaved 1.4 kb fragment was then directionally cloned by ligation into Eco RI-/Vot I cleaved pXYG1051 (WO 2005/080559) using T4 ligase according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli TOP10F competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformation mixture was plated onto LB plates supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. Plasmid minipreps were prepared from several transformants and sequenced. One plasmid with the correct Neosartorya fischeri GH5 coding sequence was chosen.      The expression plasmid pXYG1051 -NP003772 was transformed into Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355 as described in WO 98/00529. Transformants were purified on selection plates to single conidia prior to sporulating them on PDA plates. Production of the Neosartorya fischeri GH5 polypeptide by the transformants was analyzed from culture supernatants of 1 ml 96 deep well stationary cultivations at 26C in YP medium with 2% maltodextrin. Expression was verified SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis- Tris Gel with MES buffer and Coomassie blue staining. One transformant was selected for further work and designated Aspergillus oryzae 83.3.      For larger scale production, Aspergillus oryzae 83.3 spores were spread onto a PDA plate and incubated for five days at 37C. The confluent spore plate was washed twice with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 to maximize the number of spores collected. The spore suspension was then used to inoculate twenty-five 500 ml flasks containing 100 ml of YPG medium. The culture was incubated at 26C with constant shaking at 120 rpm. At day five post-inoculation, the culture broth was collected by filtration through a triple layer of Whatman glass microfiber filters of 1.6 , 1.2 , and 0.7 . Fresh culture broth from this transformant produced a band of GH7 protein of approximately 46 kDa. The identity of this band as the Neosartorya fischeri GH5 polypeptide was verified by peptide sequencing.      Two liters of the filtered broth were concentrated to 400 ml and washed with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0 using a SARTOFLOW Alpha ultrafiltration system with a 10 kDa MW-CO. Ammonium sulphate was added to a final concentration of 1 M and dissolved in the ultrafiltrate. The solution was applied on a Source 15 Phenyl XK 26/20 50 ml column. After application the column was washed with 150 ml of 1 M ammonium sulphate and eluded with 1 column volume of 50% ethanol in a 0% to 100% gradient followed by 5 column volumes of 50% ethanol at a flow rate of 10 ml/minute. Fractions of 10 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fraction 3 to 8 were pooled and diluted to 1000 ml with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0 before application on a Q Sepharose Fast Flow column XK26/20 60 ml column. After application the column was washed 3 times with 60 ml of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0 and eluded with 100 ml of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 1 M NaCI at a flow rate of 10 ml/minute. Fractions of 10 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The flow-through and first wash were pooled and concentrated to 400 ml and washed with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0 using the ultrafiltration system described above. Further concentration was conducted using a VIVASPIN centrifugal concentrator according to the manufacturer's instructions to a final volume of 80 ml. The protein concentration was determined by A280/A260 absorbance. Protein concentration was also determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 73: Preparation of Aspergillus aculeatus strain WDCM190 GH3 beta- glucosidase      The Aspergillus aculeatus strain WDCM190 GH3 beta-glucosidase (SEQ ID NO: 177     [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 178 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      To generate genomic DNA for PCR amplification, Aspergillus aculeatus WDCM190 was propagated on PDA agar plates by growing at 26C for 7 days. Spores harvested from the PDA plates were inoculated into 25 ml of YP+2% glucose medium in a baffled shake flask and incubated at 26C for 48 hours with agitation at 200 rpm.      Genomic DNA was isolated according to a modified FastDNA SPIN protocol (Qbiogene, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, a FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil (Qbiogene, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used in a FastPrep 24 Homogenization System (MP Biosciences, Santa Ana, CA, USA). Two ml of fungal material were harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 2 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in 500  of deionized water. The suspension was transferred to a Lysing Matrix E FastPrep tube (Qbiogene, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 790  of sodium phosphate buffer and 100  of MT buffer from the FastDNA SPIN Kit were added to the tube. The sample was then secured in a FastPrep Instrument (Qbiogene, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) and processed for 60 seconds at a speed of 5.5 m/sec. The sample was then centrifuged at 14000 x g for two minutes and the supernatant transferred to a clean EPPENDORF tube. A 250  volume of PPS reagent from the FastDNA SPIN Kit was added and then the sample was mixed gently by inversion. The sample was again centrifuged at 14000 x g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to a 15 ml tube followed by 1 ml of Binding Matrix suspension from the FastDNA SPIN Kit and then mixed by inversion for two minutes. The sample was placed in a stationary tube rack and the silica matrix was allowed to settle for 3 minutes. A 500  volume of the supernatant was removed and discarded and then the remaining sample was resuspended in the matrix. The sample was then transferred to a SPIN filter tube from the FastDNA SPIN Kit and centrifuged at 14000 x g for 1 minute. The catch tube was emptied and the remaining matrix suspension added to the SPIN filter tube. The sample was again centrifuged (14000 x g, 1 minute). A 500  volume of SEWS-M solution from the FastDNA SPIN Kit was added to the SPIN filter tube and the sample was centrifuged at the same speed for 1 minute. The catch tube was emptied and the SPIN filter replaced in the catch tube. The unit was centrifuged at 14000 x g for 2 minutes to ""dry"" the matrix of residual SEWS-M wash solution. The SPIN filter was placed in a fresh catch tube and allowed to air dry for 5 minutes at room temperature. The matrix was gently resuspended in 100  of DES (DNase/Pyrogen free water) with a pipette tip. The unit was centrifuged (14000 x g, 1 minute) to elute the genomic DNA followed by elution with 100  of 10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 by renewed centrifugation at 14000 x g for 1 minute and the eluates were combined. The concentration of the DNA harvested from the catch tube was measured by a UV spectrophotometer at 260 nm.      The Aspergillus aculeatus Cel3 beta-glucosidase gene was isolated by PCR using two cloning primers GH3-8f and GH3-8r shown below, which were designed based on the publicly available Aspergillus aculeatus Cel3 mRNA sequence (Genbank D64088.1 ) for direct cloning by IN-FUSION strategy.      Primer GH3-8f:      5'-acacaactggggatccaccatgaagctcagttggcttgaggcgg-3' (SEQ ID NO: 227)      Primer GH3-8r:      5'-agatctcgagaagcttattgcaccttcgggagcgccgcgtgaag-3' (SEQ ID NO: 228)      A PCR reaction was performed with genomic DNA prepared from Aspergillus aculeatus strain (IAM2445; WDCM190) in order to amplify the full-length gene. The PCR reaction was composed of 1  of genomic DNA, 0.75  of primer GH3-8f (10 ), 0.75  of primer GH3-8r (10 ), 3  of 5X HF buffer, 0.25  of 50 mM MgCI2, 0.3  of 10 mM dNTP, 0.15  of PHUSION DNA polymerase, and PCR-grade water up to 15 . The PCR reaction was performed using a DYAD PCR machine programmed for 2 minutes at 98C followed by 10 touchdown cycles at 98C for 15 seconds, 70C (-1 C/cycle) for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds; and 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 60C for 30 seconds, 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds, and 5 minutes at 72C.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where an approximately 2.9 kb PCR product band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. DNA corresponding to the Aspergillus aculeatus Cel3 beta-glucosidase gene was cloned into the expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005042735) linearized with Bam HI and Hind III, using an IN-FUSION Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      A 2.5  volume of the diluted ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli TOP10 chemically competent cells. Three colonies were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 g of ampicillin per ml and cultivated overnight in 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. Plasmid DNA was purified using an E.Z.N.A.<> Plasmid Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Aspergillus aculeatus Cel3 beta- glucosidase gene sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing before heterologous expression.      The coding sequence is 2940 bp including the stop codon and is interrupted by 6 introns of 73 bp (nucleotides 58 to 130), 52 bp (nucleotides 274 to 325), 57 bp (nucleotides 371 to 427), 61 bp (nucleotides 481 to 541 ), 64 bp (nucleotides 1734 to 1797), and 50 bp (nucleotides 2657 to 2706). The encoded predicted protein is 860 amino acids. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 19 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 841 amino acids.      Protoplasts of Aspergillus oryzae BECh2 (WO 2000/39322) were prepared as described in WO 95/02043. One hundred microliters of protoplast suspension were mixed with 2.5-15 g of the Aspergillus expression vector and 250  of 60% PEG 4000 (Applichem Inc. Omaha, NE, USA) (polyethylene glycol, molecular weight 4,000), 10 mM CaCI2, and 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5 were added and gently mixed. The mixture was incubated at 37C for 30 minutes and the protoplasts were spread on COVE sucrose (1 M) plates supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCI for transformant selection. After incubation for 4-7 days at 37C spores of several transformants were seeded on YP-2% maltodextrin medium. After 4 days cultivation at 30C culture broth was analyzed in order to identify the best transformants based on their ability to produce a large amount of active Aspergillus aculeatus Cel3 beta-glucosidase. The screening was based on intensity of the band corresponding to the heterologous expressed protein determined by SDS-PAGE and activity of the enzyme on 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) as described in Example 16 herein.      Spores of the best transformant designated were spread on COVE plates containing 0.01 % TRITON X-100 in order to isolate single colonies. The spreading was repeated twice in total on COVE sucrose medium (Cove, 1996, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 133: 51-56) containing 1 M sucrose and 10 mM sodium nitrate, supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCI. Fermentation was then carried out in 250 ml shake flasks using YP-2% maltodextrin medium for 4 days at 30C with shaking at 100 rpm. The broth was filtered using standard methods. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.

Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 76: Preparation of Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 GH3 beta-glucosidase      The Thielavia terrestris GH3 beta-glucosidase (SEQ ID NO: 183 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 184 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below. Three agarose plugs from culture of Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 grown on a PDA plate were inoculated into 100 ml of NNCYP medium supplemented with 1.5% glucose and incubated for 25 hours at 42C and 200 rpm on an orbital shaker. Fifty ml of this culture was used to inoculate 1.8 liter of NNCYP medium supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 52 g of powdered cellulose per liter and was incubated at 42C. The pH was controlled at 5.0 by the addition of 15% ammonium hydroxide or 5 N phosphoric acid, as needed.      The fermentations were run at 42C with minimum dissolved oxygen at 25% at a 1.0 WM air flow and an agitation at 1 100 rpm. Feed medium was delivered into a 2 liter fermentation vessel at 0 hours with a feed rate of 6.0-8.0 g/hour for 120 hours. Pooled cultures were centrifuged at 3000 x g for 10 minutes and the supernatant was filtered through a disposable filtering unit with a glass fiber prefilter (Nalgene, Rochester NY, USA). The filtrate was cooled to 4C for storage.      A 0.3 ml aliquot of the filtrate was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) - 80% acetone for 20 minutes on ice. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 x g. The supernatant was removed and the protein pellet remaining was rinsed with cold acetone. The protein pellet was dissolved in 30  of 1X lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) SDS-PAGE loading buffer with 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and heated at 80C for 10 minutes. A 15  sample was separated by SDS-PAGE using a 7 cm 4-12% NuPAGE Bis- Tris SDS-PAGE gradient gel and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) running buffer. The SDS-PAGE was run under reducing conditions according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The gel was removed from the cassette and rinsed 3 times with deionized water for at least 5 minutes each and stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie Stain (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) for 1 hour followed by destaining with doubly-distilled water for more than 30 minutes. Protein bands observed at approximately 95 kD was excised and reduced with 50  of 10 mM DTT in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 minutes. Following reduction, the gel pieces were alkylated with 50  of 55 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 20 minutes. The dried gel pieces were allowed to re-hydrate in a trypsin digestion solution (6 ng/ sequencing grade trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate) for 30 minutes at room temperature, followed by an 8 hour digestion at 40C. Each of the reaction steps described was followed by numerous washes and pre-washes with the desired solutions. Fifty  of acetonitrile was used to de-hydrate the gel pieces between reactions and they were air-dried between steps. Peptides were extracted twice with 1 % formic acid/2% acetonitrile in HPLC grade water for 30 minutes. Peptide extraction solutions were transferred to a 96 well PCR type microtiter plate that had been cooled to 10-15C. Microtiter plates containing the recovered peptide solutions were sealed to prevent evaporation and stored at 4C until mass spectrometry analysis could be performed.      For de-novo peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry, a Q-Tof micro, a hybrid orthogonal quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters Micromass<> MS Technologies, Milford, MA, USA) was used for LC/MS/MS analysis. The Q-Tof micro was fitted with an Ultimate capillary and nano-flow HPLC system which had been coupled with a FAMOS micro autosampler and a Switchos II column switching device (LCPackings, San Francisco, CA, USA) for concentrating and desalting samples. Samples were loaded onto a guard column (300  ID X 5 cm, C18 pepmap) fitted in the injection loop and washed with 0.1 % formic acid in water at 40 /minute for 2 minutes using the Switchos II pump. Peptides were separated on a 75  ID x 15 cm, C18, 3 , 100A PepMap (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA, USA) nanoflow fused capillary column at a flow rate of 175 nl/minute from a split flow of 175 /minute using a NAN-75 calibrator (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A step elution gradient of 5% to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1 % formic acid was applied over a 45 minute interval. The column eluent was monitored at 215 nm and introduced into the Q-Tof micro through an electrospray ion source fitted with the nanospray interface. The Q-Tof micro is fully microprocessor controlled using Masslynx software version 3.5 (Waters Micromass<> MS Technologies, Milford, MA, USA). Data was acquired in survey scan mode and from a mass range of m/z 400 to 1990 with the switching criteria for MS to MS/MS to include an ion intensity of greater than 10.0 counts per second and charge states of +2, +3, and +4. Analysis spectra of up to 4 co-eluting species with a scan time of 1.9 seconds and inter-scan time of 0.1 seconds could be obtained. A cone voltage of 65 volts was typically used and the collision energy was programmed to be varied according to the mass and charge state of the eluting peptide and in the range of 10 - 60 volts. The acquired spectra were combined, smoothed and centered in an automated fashion and a peak list generated. This peak list was searched against selected public and private databases using ProteinLynx Global Server 1.1 software (Waters Micromass<> MS Technologies, Milford, MA). Results from the ProteinLynx searches were evaluated and un-identified proteins were analyzed further by evaluating the MS/MS spectrums of each ion of interest and de-novo sequence was determined by identifying the y and b ion series and matching mass differences to the appropriate amino acid.      Peptide sequences obtained from de novo sequencing by mass spectrometry were obtained from several multiply charged ions for the approximately 95 kDa polypeptide gel band.      A doubly charged tryptic peptide ion of 524.76 m/z sequence was determined to be Ser-Pro-Phe-Thr-Trp-Gly-Pro-Thr-Arg (amino acids 607 to 615 of SEQ ID NO: 184). A second doubly charged tryptic peptide ion of 709.91 partial sequence was determined to be Gly-Val-Asn-Val-[lle/Leu]-[lle-Leu]-Gly-[lle/Leu]-Gly-Pro (amino acids 148 to 155 of SEQ ID NO: 184). A second doubly charged tryptic peptide ion of 745.38 partial sequence was determined to be Pro-Pro-His-Ala-Thr-Asp (amino acids 747 to 752 of SEQ ID NO: 184). A third doubly charged tryptic peptide ion of 808.92 m/z sequence was determined to be Tyr- Glu-Ser-[lle/Leu]-[lle/Leu]-Ser-Asn-Tyr-Ala-Thr-Ser-Qln-[lle/Leu]-Lys (amino acids 487 to 499 of SEQ ID NO: 184). A fourth doubly charged tryptic peptide ion of 1023.96 a partial sequence was determined to be Phe-Asn-Ser-Gly-Phe-Pro-Ser-Gly-Gln-Thr-Ala-Ala-Ala-Thr- Phe-Asp-Arg (amino acids 1 14 to 130 of SEQ ID NO: 184).      To generate genomic DNA for PCR amplification, Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 was grown in 50 ml of NNCYP medium supplemented with 1 % glucose in a baffled shake flask at 42C and 200 rpm for 24 hours. Mycelia were harvested by filtration, washed twice in TE (10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA), and frozen under liquid nitrogen. A pea-size piece of frozen mycelia was suspended in 0.7 ml of 1 % lithium dodecyl sulfate in TE and disrupted by agitation with an equal volume of 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA) for 45 seconds in a FastPrep FP120 (ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY, USA). Debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 10 minutes and the cleared supernatant was brought to 2.5 M ammonium acetate and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. After the incubation period, the nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of 2 volumes of ethanol. After centrifugation for 15 minutes in a microfuge at 4C, the pellet was washed in 70% ethanol and air dried. The DNA was resuspended in 120  of 0.1 X TE and incubated with 1  of DNase-free RNase A at 37C for 20 minutes. Ammonium acetate was added to 2.5 M and the DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol. The pellet was washed in 70% ethanol, air dried, and resuspended in TE buffer.      A low redundancy draft sequence of the Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 genome was generated by the Joint Genome Center (JGI), Walnut Creek, CA, USA, using the whole genome shotgun method according to Martinez et al., 2008, Nature Biotechnol. 26: 553-560. Shotgun sequencing reads (approximately 18307) were assembled into contigs using the Phrap assembler (Ewing and Green, 1998, Genome Res. 8: 186-194).      A tblastn search (Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402) of the assembled contigs was carried out using as query a beta-glucosidase protein sequence from Neurospora crassa UniProt accession number q7rwp2). A translated amino acid sequence with greater than 73.8% identity to the query sequence was identified.      The sequence was searched against public databases using blastp (Altschul et al., 1997, supra) and was found to be 80.1 % identical to a beta-glucosidase from Podospora anserina (UniProt accession number B2AVE8).      The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the Thielavia terrestris beta-glucosidase gene are shown in SEQ ID NO: 183 and SEQ ID NO: 184, respectively. The coding sequence is 3032 bp including the stop codon and is interrupted by three introns of 295 bp, 57 bp, and 61 bp. The encoded predicted protein is 872 amino acids. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 18 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 854 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 93 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.57.      Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 was grown for 3 days on PDA plates at 45C. Mycelia were scraped from the plates and approximately 100 mg of mycelia (wet weight) were used to inoculate 500 ml shake flasks containing 100 ml of either MY50 medium or 1X Vogel's medium supplemented with 2% microcrystalline cellulose (AVICEL). Cultures were grown for 2, 3, 4 and 5 days at 45C with vigorous shaking. The mycelia were harvested by filtration through MIRACLOTH (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown, NJ, USA), and quick frozen in liquid nitrogen.      To isolate total RNA frozen mycelia of Thielavia terrestris NRRL 8126 were ground in an electric coffee grinder. The ground material was mixed 1 :1 v/v with 20 ml of FENAZOL (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX, USA) in a 50 ml tube. Once the mycelia were suspended, they were extracted with chloroform and three times with a mixture of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1 v/v/v. From the resulting aqueous phase, the RNA was precipitated by adding 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 1.25 volumes of isopropanol. The precipitated RNA was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4C. The final pellet was washed with cold 70% ethanol, air dried, and resuspended in 500 ml of diethylpyrocarbonate treated water (DEPC-water).      RNA samples were pooled and the quality and quantity of the purified RNA was assessed with an AGILENT 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). A total of 630 [Jig of RNA was isolated.      Poly A+ RNA was isolated from total RNA using an Absolutely mRNA Purification     Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis and cloning was performed according to a procedure based on the Superscript Plasmid System with Gateway Technology for cDNA Synthesis and Cloning (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA, USA). 1 -2 g of poly A+ RNA, reverse transcriptase Superscript II (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA, USA), and oligo dT-/ I primer 5'- GACTAGTTCTAGATCGCGAGCGGCCGCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTVN-3' (SEQ ID NO: 233) were used to synthesize first strand cDNA. Second strand synthesis was performed with . coli DNA ligase, polymerase I, and RNase H followed by end repair using T4 DNA polymerase. The Sal I adaptor (5'-TCGACCCACGCGTCCG-3' [SEQ ID NO: 234] and 5'- CGGACGCGTGGG-3' [SEQ ID NO: 235]) was ligated to the cDNA, digested with Not I, and subsequently size selected (>2 kb) by 1 .1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer. The cDNA inserts were directionally ligated into Sal I and Not I digested vector pCMVsport6 (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA, USA). The ligation was transformed into ElectroMAX DH10B T1 cells (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA, USA).      Library quality was first assessed by randomly selecting 24 clones and PCR amplifying the cDNA inserts with the primers M13-F and M13-R shown below to determine the fraction of insertless clones.      Primer M13-F:      5'-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3' (SEQ iD NO: 236)      Primer M13-R:      5 '-AG G AAAC AG CT ATG AC C AT-3 ' (SEQ iD NO: 237)      Colonies from each library were plated onto LB plates at a density of approximately     1000 colonies per plate. Plates were grown at 37C for 18 hours and then individual colonies were picked and each used to inoculate a well containing LB medium supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml in a 384 well plate (Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA). Clones were grown at 37C for 18 hours. Plasmid DNA for sequencing was produced by rolling circle amplification using a Templiphi Kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Subclone inserts were sequenced from both ends using primers complimentary to the flanking vector sequence as shown below and BigDye terminator chemistry using a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).      Forward primer:      5'-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAA-3' (SEQ iD NO: 238)      Reverse primer:      5 '-T AAT AC G ACT C ACTATAG G G-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 239)      A clone showing 67.4% identity at the nucleotide level to a beta-glucosidase from Aspergillus oryzae (U.S. Published Application No. 2005233423) was identified.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below were designed to PCR amplify the Thielavia terrestris Family GH3B beta-glucosidase gene from the cDNA clone. An INFUSION Cloning Kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pAILo2 (WO 2005/074647), without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      Forward primer:      5'-ACTGGATTTACCATGAAGCCTGCCATTGTGCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 240)      Reverse primer:      5 '-T C AC CT CT AGTT AATTAATC ACG G C AACTC AATG CTC A-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 241 )      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pAILo2.      Fifty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing 200 ng of plasmid cDNA, 1X 2X Advantage GC-Melt LA Buffer (Clonetech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), 1  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 1.25 units of Advantage GC Genomic LA Polymerase Mix (Clonetech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed using an EPPENDORF MASTERCYCLER 5333 epgradient S (Eppendorf Scientific, Inc., Westbury, NY, USA) programmed for one cycle at 94C for 1 minute; and 30 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 60.5C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 3 minutes. The heat block was then held at 72C for 15 minutes followed by a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1 .0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where an approximately 2.6 kb product band was excised from the gel and purified using a MINELUTE Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The fragment was then cloned into pAILo2 using an IN-FUSION Cloning Kit. The vector was digested with Nco I and Pac I. The fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis as above and a QIAQUICK Gel Purification Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The gene fragment and the digested vector were combined together in a reaction resulting in the expression plasmid pAG81 , in which transcription of the Family GH3B protein gene was under the control of the NA2-tpi promoter (a hybrid of the promoters from the genes for Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase and Aspergillus nidulans triose phosphate isomerase). The recombination reaction (10 ) was composed of 1X IN-FUSION Buffer (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 1X BSA (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 1  of IN-FUSION enzyme (diluted 1 :10) (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), 108 ng of pAILo2 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 94 ng of the Thielavia terrestris GH3B protein purified PCR product. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes followed by 15 minutes at 50C. The reaction was diluted with 40  of 10 mM Tris-0.1 M EDTA buffer and 2.5  of the diluted reaction was used to transform E. coli TOP10 Competent cells. An . coli transformant containing pAG81 (GH3B protein gene) was identified by restriction enzyme digestion and plasmid DNA was prepared using a BIOROBOT 9600. The plasmid construct was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 3130x1 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to verify the gene sequence.      Aspergillus oryzae JaL355 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of     Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422, which were transformed with 5 g of pAG81 . Twenty-six transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates. A small plug from each transformant was used to inoculate 1 ml of M410 media in a 24 well plate and incubated at 34C. After 5 days of incubation, 7.5  of supernatant from four transformants was analyzed using a CRITERION stain-free, 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that several transformants had a new major band of approximately 150 kDa.      A confluent PDA plate of the top transformant (was washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and inoculated into 500 ml flasks each containing 100 ml of M410 medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The flasks were harvested on day 5, filtered using a 0.22  stericup suction filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), and stored at 4C.      A 45 ml aliquot of shake flask broth prepared was concentrated ten-fold using a VIVASPIN centrifugal concentrator with a molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa and buffer- exchanged into 50 mM sodium acetate of pH 5. A 4 ml aliquot of the buffer-exchanged, concentrated broth was then diluted to a 10 ml volume with 1 M Tris-HCI pH 8 and water to a concentration of 20 mM Tris-HCI, and the pH adjusted to a final value of 8 using 2 N sodium hydroxide. The resulting material was then purified using a MONO Q 5/5 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCI buffer pH 7.8. Unbound material was washed from the column with 2 ml equilibration buffer, and then the column was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 - 500 mM sodium chloride in the equilibration buffer. Fractions of 0.3 ml were collected. Unbound material collected during column loading and unbound material washed from the column were pooled for a total volume of 12 ml. Five  of the fractions, including the pooled unbound material, showing UV absorbance at 280 nm were analyzed using a CRITERION STAIN FREE 8-16% Tris-HCI SDS-PAGE gel (Bio- Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Precision Plus Protein unstained standards (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) were used as molecular weight markers. The gel was removed from the cassette and imaged using a CRITERION STAIN FREE IMAGER (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The beta-glucosidase was identified in the pooled unbound material as a band at 150 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The 12 ml of pooled unbound material was concentrated as described above to a final volume of 2 ml. The concentrated material was purified using a HILOAD 16/60 SUPERDEX 75 PREP GRADE column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris.HCI buffer of pH 7.8 containing 150 mM sodium chloride, and eluted with the equilibration buffer. Fractions of 3 ml were collected. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Fractions containing the purified beta- glucosidase, identified by a band at 150 kDa by SDS-PAGE, were pooled for a total volume of 6 ml. The pooled material was concentrated using a VIVASPIN centrifugal concentrator with a molecular weight cut-off of 5 kDa (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) to a final volume of 0.4 ml. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).      The enzyme activity of the purified beta-glucosidase was measured using p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside as substrate. A p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside stock solution was made by dissolving p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to constitute a 0.1 M solution. Before assay, a sample of the stock solution was diluted 100-fold in 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5 containing 0.01 % TWEEN 20 to a 1 mM solution. A 100  volume of 1 mM p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside was mixed with each dilution of the enzyme for a 120  total volume, and then incubated at 40C for 20 minutes. Substrate alone, enzyme alone, and buffer alone were run as controls, p- Nitrophenol standard solutions of 0.40, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, and 0.02 mM were prepared by diluting a 10 mM stock solution in 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5 containing 0.01 % TWEEN 20. At 20 minutes, 50  of 1 .0 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 10 was added to each well (including samples, substrate control, enzyme control, reagent control, and standards), mixed, and the absorbance at 405 nm immediately measured on a SPECTRAMAX 340 PC plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The activity measured was 84 units per mg of protein. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme capable of releasing 1  of p-nitrophenolate anion per minute at pH 5, 40C.      The enzyme activity of the purified beta-glucosidase was also measured with cellobiose. A 2 mg/ml stock solution of cellobiose was prepared in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5 containing 0.01 % TWEEN 20, and 100  were combined with each enzyme dilution for a total volume of 150  and incubated at 50C for 30 minutes. Substrate alone, enzyme alone, and buffer alone were run as controls. Glucose standard solutions of 1 .0, 0.50, 0.25, 0.125, 0.063, and 0.031 mg/ml were prepared in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5. containing 0.01 % TWEEN 20. At 30 minutes, 50  of 0.5 M sodium hydroxide solution was added to each well (including samples, substrate control, enzyme control, reagent control, and standards), mixed, and then 20  of the mixture was transferred to a Costar EIA/RIA 96-well plate (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) and combined with 200  of GLUCOSE OXIDASE REAGENT (Pointe Scientific, Inc., Canton, Ml, USA), and allowed to stand at 25C for 20 minutes and then the absorbance at 500 nm was measured on a SPECTRAMAX 340 PC plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The activity measured was 264 units per mg of protein. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme capable of releasing 1  of glucose per minute at pH 5, 50C.      Example 77: Preparation of Penicillium oxalicum strain IBT5387 GH3 beta-glucosidase     The Penicillium oxalicum strain IBT5387 (Technical University of Denmark; NN005786) GH3 beta-glucosidase (SEQ ID NO: 185 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 186 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below. Aspergillus oryzae BECh2 (WO 2000/39322) was used as a host cell for expressing the P. oxalicum strain IBT5387 Family GH3 beta-glucosidase gene.      A set of degenerate primers shown below were designed according to the strategy described by Rose et al., 1998, Nucleic Acids Research 26: 1628-1635, for cloning a gene encoding a beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21 ) belonging to Family GH3.

The forward primers (GH3scree.f1 , GH3scree.f2, GH3scree.f5, or GH3scree.f6) (0.33  of a 10 mM stock) were combined with the reverse primers (GH3scree.r1 , GH3scree.r2, GH3scree.r3, GH3scree.r4, GH3scree.r5, or GH3scree.r6) (0.33  of a 10 mM stock) in a 10  mixture containing 0.33  of P. oxalicum genomic DNA and 5  of REDDYMIX Extensor PCR Master Mix 1 (ABgene Ltd., Surrey, United Kingdom). P. oxalicum genomic DNA was obtained according to the procedure described in the FastDNA SPIN Kit (Q-BIOgene, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR reaction was performed using a DYAD Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) programmed for one cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; 9 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 63C for 30 seconds with a decrease of 1 C for each cycle, and 68C for 1 minutes 45 seconds; 24 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 55C for 30 seconds, and 68C for 1 minutes 45 seconds; and extension at 68C for 7 minutes.      PCR products obtained during the first PCR were re-amplified with their corresponding primers by transferring 0.5  of the first PCR reaction to a second 20  mixture containing the same concentration of primers, dNTPs, DNA polymerase, and buffer as the first PCR reaction. The second PCR was performed using a DYAD Thermal Cycler programmed for one cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; 24 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 58C for 30 seconds, and 68C for 1 minutes 45 seconds; and an extension at 68C for 7 minutes.      PCR products obtained during the second amplification were analyzed by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer. Single bands ranging from 2000 to 800 nucleotides in size were excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified DNA samples were directly sequenced with primers used for amplification. Sequences were assembled in SeqMan v7.2.1 (DNA star, Madison, Wl, USA) into a contig that was used for designing primers shown below, based on recommendations of length and temperature described in a GENE WALKING SPEEDUP Kit (Seegene, Inc., Seoul, Korea).      5786GH3-51TSP1f:      C AC C AAC AC C G G C AAT CT AG C (SEQ ID NO: 252)      5786GH3-51TSP2f:      GGTGACGAGGTTGTCCAACTGTACG (SEQ ID NO: 253)      5786GH3-51TSP1 r:      CTTGAAGCCAAGGCGAGG (SEQ ID NO: 254)      5786GH3-51TSP2r:      TCCGGTATTTCCTACACATGGTCC (SEQ ID NO: 255)      GeneWalking was based on the protocol from the GENE WALKING SPEEDUP Kit with some minor differences. Only two PCR amplifications were carried out and in both cases, the REDDYMIX Extensor PCR Master Mix 1 was used in place of the enzyme mix present in the Kit. GeneWalking PCR 1 was performed in a total volume of 15  by mixing 1.2  of primer 1 to 4 (2.5 mM) from the GENE WALKING SPEEDUP Kit with 0.3  of primer 5786GH3-51TSP1f or primer 5786GH3-51TSP1 r (10 mM) in the presence of 7.5  of REDDYMIX Extensor PCR Master Mix 1 , and 0.5  of P. oxalicum genomic DNA. The PCR was performed using a DYAD Thermal Cycler programmed for one cycle at 94C for 3 minutes followed by 1 minute at 42C and 2 minutes at 68C; 30 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 58C for 30 seconds, and 68C for 1 minute and 40 seconds; and elongation at 68C for 7 minutes. A 0.5  aliquot of the amplification reaction was transferred to a second PCR tube containing a 20  mixture composed of 10  of REDDYMIX Extensor PCR Master Mix 1 , 1  of primer 5 (10 mM) from the Kit, 1  of primers T5786GH3-51 SP2f or 5786GH3-51TSP2r (10 mM). The amplification was performed in a DYAD Thermal Cycler programmed for denaturation at 94C for 3 minutes; 35 cycles each at 94C for 30 seconds, 58C for 30 seconds, and 68C for 1 minute and 40 seconds; and elongation at 68C for 7 minutes.      The PCR products were analyzed by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer.     Single bands ranging from 700 to 1200 nucleotides in size were excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Purified DNA samples were directly sequenced with the primers used for amplification.      Based on blastx analyses, the start and the stop codons of the gene were identified and the primers shown below were designed for cloning the gene into the expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005042735) using an IN-FUSION Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit.      5786GH3-51 :      agatctcgagaagcttaCCATGACTCCAATCGCGCGCTCAAGG (SEQ ID NO: 256)      5786GH3-51f1 :      acacaactggggatccaccATGAGGAGCTCAACGACGGTTCTGGCC (SEQ ID NO: 257)      The P. oxalicum beta-glucosidase gene was amplified by PCR using the two cloning primers described above with P. oxalicum strain IBT5387 genomic DNA. The PCR was composed of 1  of P. oxalicum genomic DNA, 0.75  of primer 5786GH3-51f1 (10 ), 0.75  of primer 5786GH3-51 (10 ), 3  of 5X HF buffer, 0.25  of 50 mM MgCI2, 0.3  of 10 mM dNTP, 0.15  of PHUSION DNA polymerase, and PCR-grade water to 15 . The amplification reaction was performed using a DYAD Thermal Cycler programmed for 2 minutes at 98C followed by 10 touchdown cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 70C (-1 C/cycle) for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes and 30 seconds; and 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 60C for 30 seconds, 72C for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, and 5 minutes at 72C.      The reaction product was isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where an approximately 2.8 kb PCR product band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. DNA corresponding to the Penicillium oxalicum beta-glucosidase gene was cloned into the expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005042735) linearized with Bam HI and Hind III, using an IN-FUSION Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      A 2.5  volume of the diluted ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli TOP10 chemically competent cells. Three colonies were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 g of ampicillin per ml and cultivated overnight in 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. Plasmid DNA was purified using an E.Z.N.A. Plasmid Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Penicillium oxalicum beta-glucosidase gene sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing before heterologous expression. One plasmid designated plF1 13#1 was selected for expressing the P. oxalicum beta-glucosidase in an Aspergillus oryzae host cell.      The coding sequence is 2793 bp including the stop codon with 2 predicted introns of     82 bp (nucleotides 85 to 1 16) and 59 bp (nucleotides 346 to 404). The encoded predicted protein is 883 amino acids. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1 -6), a signal peptide of 21 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 862 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 94.7 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.04.      Protoplasts of Aspergillus oryzae BECh2 (WO 2000/39322) were prepared according to WO 95/002043. One hundred  of protoplasts were mixed with 2.5-15 g of the Aspergillus expression vector and 250  of 60% PEG 4000 (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany) (polyethylene glycol, molecular weight 4,000), 10 mM CaCI2, and 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5 and gently mixed. The mixture was incubated at 37C for 30 minutes and the protoplasts were spread onto COVE plates for selection. After incubation for 4-7 days at 37C spores of sixteen transformants were inoculated into 0.5 ml of YP medium supplemented with 2% maltodextrin in 96 deep-well plates. After 4 days cultivation at 30C, the culture broths were analyzed to identify the best transformants producing large amounts of active P. oxalicum beta-glucosidase. The analysis was based on SDS-PAGE and activity of the enzyme on 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) as described in Example 16.      Spores of the best transformant were spread on COVE plates containing 0.01 % TRITON X-100 in order to isolate single colonies. The spreading was repeated twice in total on COVE plates containing 10 mM sodium nitrate. Spores were then inoculated into 100 ml of YP medium supplemented with 2% maltodextrin in 250 ml shake flasks and incubated for 4 days at 30C with shaking at 100 rpm.      Combined supernatants of the shake flask cultures were first filtered using a glass micro fiber filter with a 0.7  pore size, and then sterile filtered using a filtration unit equipped with a PES (Polyether sulfone) with a 0.22  pore size (Nalge Nunc International, New York, NY USA). The sterile filtered supernatant was then adjusted to a concentration of 2 M ammonium sulfate by slowly adding solid ammonium sulfate, dissolving by gentle stirring, and then filtering using a glass micro fiber filter with a 0.7  pore size. If there was any precipitate, it was discarded.      The filtered supernatant was applied to a 50 ml Toyopearl Phenyl-650M column     (TOSOH Bioscience GmbH, Germany) equilibrated with 2 M ammonium sulfate in water and unbound material was eluted with 2 M ammonium sulfate until the UV absorbance at 280 nm was below 0.05. Bound protein was eluted with 50% ethanol as solution B using a step gradient. Ten ml fractions were collected and moniterd by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled the fractions containing protein with theexpected molecular weight. The pooled fractions were dialyzed using 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 buffer, so the ionic strength was below 4 MSi and the pH was 7.5.      The pooled protein was applied to a 50 ml Q Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 buffer and unbound material was eluted with 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5. The bound protein was then eluted with a linear 20 column volume salt gradient in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5 containing 1 M NaCI as buffer B. Ten ml fractions of the eluate were collected and each were analyzed for purity of the protein by SDS-PAGE. The fractions with highest purity were pooled. Identity of the beta-glucosidase was confirmed by mass spectroscopy and protein identification was carried out by in gel digestion. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 78: Preparation of Penicillium oxalicum strain IBT5387 GH3 beta-glucosidase     The Penicillium oxalicum strain IBT5387 (Technical University of Denmark; NN005786) GH3 beta-glucosidase (SEQ ID NO: 187 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 188 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      Genomic DNA was isolated according to the procedure described in Example 73.     A set of degenerate primers (shown below) was hand-designed according to the strategy described by Rose et al., 1998, Nucleic Acids Res. 26: 1628-1635, for targetting beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21 ) belonging to Family GH3.

Each forward primers (f1 , f2, f5, and f6) (0.33  of a 10 mM stock) was combined with each reverse primers (r1 , r2, r3, r4, r5, and r6) (0.33  of a 10 mM stock) in a 10  mix containing 0.33  genomic DNA, 5  of Reddy Mix Extensor PCR Master Mix 1 (Cat# AB-0794/A, ABgene UK, commercialized by Thermo Fisher Scientific). A hot-start PCR reaction was carried out in a DYAD PCR machine for 2 minutes at 94C followed by 9 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 63C for 30 seconds with a 1 C decrease for each cycle, 68C for 1 minute 45 seconds, and followed by 24 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 55C for 30 seconds, 68C for 1 minute 45 seconds, supplemented by a 7 minutes extension at 68C. PCR-products produced during this first PCR were re-amplified with their corresponding primers by transferring 0.5 of the first PCR reaction to a second 20  mix containing the same concentration of primers, dNTPs, polymerase, and buffer than in the first PCR reaction. The second PCR was carried out on the same PCR block at 94C for 2 minutes followed by 24 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 58C for 30 seconds, 68C for 1 minute 45 seconds and completed by a 7 minutes extension at 68C. PCR products produced during the second amplification were analyzed on 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer. Single bands ranging from 2000 to 800 nts in size were collected and eluted using the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Purified DNA samples were directly sequenced with primers used for amplification.      Sequences were assembled in SeqMan v7.2.1 (DNA star, Madison, Wl, USA) into a contig that was used for nblast searches (Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389- 3402) on publicly available sequences. Results of the search indicated that the sequence GenBank EU700488.1 was nearly identical to the contig identified. Therefore, the cloning primers 5786GH3-50f and 5786GH3-50r were designed based on the sequence information of the cds from GenBank EU700488.1 for IN-FUSION cloning according to the manufacturer instructions for cloning in the expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005/042735). 5786GH3-50M :      5'-acacaactggggatccaccATGAAGCTCGAGTGGCTGGAAGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 268)      5786GH3-50r1      5'-agatctcgagaagcttaCTGCACCTTGGGCAGATCGGCTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 269)      The Penicillium oxalicum beta-glucosidase gene was amplified by PCR using the two cloning primers described previously in a PCR reaction that was performed with genomic DNA prepared from the strain IBT5387 (from DTU received in 1992). The PCR reaction was composed of 1  of genomic DNA, 0.75  of primer 5786GH3-51f1 (10 ); 0.75  of primer 5786GH3-51 r1 (10 ); 3  of 5X HF buffer, 0.25  of 50 mM MgCI2, 0.3  of 10mM dNTP; 0.15  of PHUSION DNA polymerase, and PCR-grade water up to 15 . The PCR reaction was performed using a DYAD PCR machine programmed for 2 minutes at 98C followed by 10 touchdown cycles at 98C for 15 seconds, 70C (-1 C/cycle) for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds; and 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 60C for 30 seconds, 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds, and 5 minutes at 72C. The reaction product was isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where an approximately 2.8 kb PCR product band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. DNA corresponding to the Penicillium oxalicum beta-glucosidase gene was cloned into the expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005042735) linearized with Bam HI and Hind II I, using an IN-FUSION Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      A 2.5  volume of the diluted ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli TOP10 chemically competent cells. Three colonies were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 g of ampicillin per ml and cultivated overnight in 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. Plasmid DNA was purified using an E.Z.N.A.<> Plasmid Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Penicillium oxalicum beta-glucosidase gene sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing before heterologous expression.      The coding sequence is 2964 bp including the stop codon and is interrupted by 5 introns of 101 bp (nucleotides 61 to 161 ), 64 bp (nucleotides 302 to 365), 79 bp (nucleotides 41 1 to 489), 63 bp (nucleotides 543 to 605), and 71 bp (nucleotides 2660 to 2730). The encoded predicted protein is 861 amino acids. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al. , 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 19 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 842 amino acids.      Protoplasts of Aspergillus oryzae BECh2 (WO 2000/39322) were prepared as described in WO 95/02043. One hundred microliters of protoplast suspension were mixed with 2.5-15 g of the Aspergillus expression vector and 250  of 60% PEG 4000, 10 mM CaCI2, and 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5 were added and gently mixed. The mixture was incubated at 37C for 30 minutes and the protoplasts were spread on COVE sucrose (1 M) plates supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCI for transformant selection. After incubation for 4-7 days at 37C spores of several transformants were seeded on YP- 2% maltodextrin medium. After 4 days cultivation at 30C culture broth was analyzed in order to identify the best transformants based on their ability to produce a large amount of active Penicillium oxalicum beta-glucosidase. The screening was based on intensity of the band corresponding to the heterologous expressed protein determined by SDS-PAGE and activity of the enzyme on 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) as described in Example 16.      Spores of the best transformant were spread on COVE plates containing 0.01 % TRITON X-100 in order to isolate single colonies. The spreading was repeated twice in total on COVE sucrose medium (Cove, 1996, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 133: 51 -56) containing 1 M sucrose and 10 mM sodium nitrate, supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCI. Fermentation was then carried out in 250 ml shake flasks using DAP-2C-1 medium for 4 days at 30C with shaking at 100 rpm.      Filtered broth was concentrated and washed with deionized water using a tangential flow concentrator equipped with a Sartocon Slice cassette with a 10 kDa MW-CO polyethersulfone membrane (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Goettingen, Germany). The concentrate was added to M ammonium sulphate and loaded onto a Phenyl Toyopearl (650M) column (Tosoh Corporation, 3-8-2 Shiba, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated in 2 M ammonium sulphate, and bound proteins were eluted with 1 M ammonium sulphate. The eluted protein was buffer exchanged with 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 with sodium chloride by ultrafiltration with a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane using Vivaspin 20 (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Goettingen, Germany). Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.

Genomic DNA was isolated according to the procedure described in Example 73.     The Talaromyces emersonii beta-glucosidase gene was isolated by PCR using two cloning primers GH3-1 1f and GH3-1 1 r shown below, which were designed based on the publicly available Talaromyces emersonii full-length sequence (Genbank AY072918.4) for direct cloning using the IN-FUSION strategy.

The PCR reaction was composed of 1  of genomic DNA, 0.75  of primer GH3-1 1f (10 ); 0.75  of primer GH3-1 1 r (10 ); 3  of 5X HF buffer, 0.25  of 50 mM MgCI2, 0.3  of 10 mM dNTP; 0.15  of PHUSION DNA polymerase, and PCR-grade water up to 15 . The PCR reaction was performed using a DYAD PCR machine programmed for 2 minutes at 98C followed by 10 touchdown cycles at 98C for 15 seconds, 70C (-1 C/cycle) for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds; and 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 60C for 30 seconds, 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds, and 5 minutes at 72C. The reaction product was isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where an approximately 2.9 kb PCR product band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions.

The Talaromyces emersonii beta-glucosidase gene sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing before heterologous expression.      The coding sequence is 2925 bp including the stop codon and is interrupted by 6 introns of 60 bp (nucleotides 61 to 120), 61 bp (nucleotides 261 to 321 ), 60 bp (nucleotides 367 to 426), 57 bp (nucleotides 480 to 536), 56 bp (nucleotides 1717 to 1772), and 54 bp (nucleotides 2632 to 2685). The encoded predicted protein is 858 amino acids. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1 -6), a signal peptide of 19 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 839 amino acids.      Protoplasts of Aspergillus oryzae BECh2 (WO 2000/39322) were prepared as described in WO 95/02043. One hundred microliters of protoplast suspension were mixed with 2.5-15 g of the Aspergillus expression vector and 250  of 60% PEG 4000, 10 mM CaCI2, and 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5 were added and gently mixed.

Fermentation was then carried out in 250 ml shake flasks using YP-2% maltodextrin medium for 4 days at 30C with shaking at 100 rpm. The broth was filtered using standard methods. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Example 80: Preparation of Thermoascus crustaceus strain CBS 181.67 GH61A polypeptide      The Thermoascus crustaceus strain CBS 181.67 GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity (SEQ ID NO: 191 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 192     [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      Aspergillus oryzae strain HowB101 (WO 95/35385) was used as a host for recombinantly expressing the Thermoascus crustaceus GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity.      Thermoascus crustaceus strain CBS 181 .67 was inoculated onto a PDA plate and incubated for 3-4 days at 45C in the darkness. Several mycelia-PDA plugs were inoculated into 500 ml shake flasks containing 100 ml of NNCYP-PCS medium. The flasks were incubated for 6 days at 45C with shaking at 160 rpm. The mycelia were collected at day 3, day 4, day 5, and day 6. Then the mycelia from each day were combined and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored in a -80C freezer until use.      Genomic DNA was extracted using a DNEASY Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). Total RNA was isolated by using a RNEASY Plant Mini Kit. cDNA was synthesized by following the instructions of the 3' Rapid Amplification of cDNA End System     (3' RACE) (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA).      Four degenerate primers shown below were designed based on conserved regions of known GH61 sequences.      GH61A scF1 :      5'-GCNACNGAYCTNGGNTTTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 272)      GH61A scF2:      5'-GCNACNGAYCTNGGNTTCG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 273)      GH61A scF3:      5'-GCNACNGAYTTRGGNTTYG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 274)      GH61A scR1 :      5'-CAYTGNGGRTARTTYTGNGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 275)      PCR was performed by using a combination of forward primers GH61A scF1 , GH61 scF2, and GH61A scF3, and reverse primer GH61A scR1 and cDNA as template. The amplification reaction was composed of 5  of 10X PCR buffer (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2  of 25 mM MgCI2, 1  of 10 mM dNTP, 1  of 100  forward primer, 1  of 100  reverse primer, 2  of cDNA, 0.5  of Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 37.5  of H20. The amplification was performed using an Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed for denaturing at 94C for 2 minutes; 30 cycles each at 94C for 40 seconds, 50C for 40 seconds, and 72C for 1 minute; and a final extension at 72C for 10 minutes.      A PCR product of approximately 500 base pairs was detected by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer. The PCR fragment was excised from the gel and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, directly sequenced, and confirmed to be a GH61A partial gene by blast. Based on this partial sequence, new primers shown below were designed for 5' and 3' end cloning using a Genome Walking Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan):      61ASPR1 :      5'-TGCAAGGAGCAAGGTAGTTGA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 276)      61ASPR2:      5'-GAGTCCATTCCAGCTTGACGGT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 277)      61ASPF1 :      5'-TCAGACAATCTGATAGCGGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 278)      61ASPF2:      5'-ATCCCAACCACAACTGCACCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 279)      For 5' end and 3' end cloning, the primary amplifications were composed of 2  of genomic DNA as template, 2.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 100 pmol of AP2 (provided by the Genome Walking Kit) and 10 pmol of primer 61ASPR1 for 5' end cloning or 100 pmol of AP3 (provided by the Genome Walking Kit), and 10 pmol of primer 61 ASPF1 for 3' end cloning, 5  of 10X LA PCR Buffer II (provided by the Genome Walking Kit), and 2.5 units of TakaRa LA Taq DNA polymerase (provided by the Genome Walking Kit) in a final volume of 50 . The amplifications were performed using an Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed for pre-denaturing at 94C for 1 minute and 98C for 1 minute; five cycles each at a denaturing temperature of 94C for 30 seconds; annealing at 60C for 1 minute and elongation at 72C for 2 minutes; 1 cycle of denaturing at 94C for 30 seconds; annealing at 25C for 3 minutes and elongation at 72C for 2 minutes; fifteen repeats of 2 cycles at 94C for 30 seconds, 62C for 1 minutes, and 72C for 2 minutes; followed by 1 cycle at 94C for 30 seconds, 44C for 1 minutes, and 72C for 2 minutes; and a final extension at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The secondary ampliifications were composed of 2  of 20X diluted primary PCR product as templates, 2.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 100 pmol of AP2, and 10 pmol of primer 61ASPR2 for 5' end cloning or 100 pmol of AP3 and 10 pmol of primer 61ASPF2 for 3' end cloning, 5  of 10X LA PCR Buffer II, and 2.5 units of TakaRa LA Taq DNA polymerase in a final volume of 50 . The amplifications were performed using an Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed for fifteen repeats of 2 cycles of 94C for 30 seconds; 62C for 1 minutes; 72C for 2 minutes; followed by 1 cycle at 94C for 30 seconds, 44C for 1 minutes, and 72C for 2 minutes; and a final extension at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The PCR products from the 5' and 3' end PCR were recovered and sequenced. They were identified as the 5' end and 3' end of the GH61A polypeptide gene. Then the three sequences including the partial gene, 5' end, and 3' end were assembled to generate the full-length GH61A.      The obtained full-length gene showed that the sequence contains a coding region of 871 nucleotides including 1 intron and stop codon, and encodes 251 amino acids with a predicted signal peptide of 22 amino acids.      Based on the full-length Thermoascus crustaceus GH61A gene sequence, oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the GH61A gene from genomic DNA of Thermoascus crustaceus CBS 181.67. An IN-FUSION CF Dry-Down Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pPFJ0355, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      Sense primer:      5'-ACACAACTGGGGATCCACCATGGCCTTTTCCCAGATAATGGCTA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 280)      Antisense primer:      5'-GTCACCCTCTAGATCTGGATCGCAGGAGCGTTCAGA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 281 )      Bold letters represent the coding sequence for the sense primer and the downstream sequence of the stop codon for the antisense primer. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pPFJ0355.      Twenty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of Thermoascus crustaceus genomic DNA, 10  of 5X GC Buffer, 1 .5  of DMSO, 2  of 2.5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 1 unit of PHUSION High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed using a Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed for denaturing at 98C for 1 minute; 5 cycles of denaturing at 98C for 15 seconds, annealing at 70C for 30 seconds, with a 1 C decrease per cycle, and elongation at 72C for 30 seconds; 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds and 72C for 90 seconds; and a final extension at 72C for 10 minutes. The heat block then went to a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer where an approximately 1.0 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      Plasmid pPFJ0355 was digested with Bam HI and Bgl II, isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together using an IN    FUSION CF Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit resulting in pGH61 a51486 in which transcription of the Thermoascus crustaceus GH61A gene was under the control of the Aspergillus oryzae TAKA-alpha-amylase promoter. In brief, 30 ng of pPFJ0355 digested with Bam HI and Bgl II and 50 ng of the Thermoascus crustaceus GH61A gene purified PCR product were added to a reaction vial and resuspended in a final volume of 10  I with deionized water. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes and then 50C for 15 minutes. Three  of the reaction were used to transform E. coli TOP10 competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transformation was spread on LB plates supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml and incubated at at 37C for 1 day. An E. coli transformant containing a plasmid designated pGH61 a51486 was detected by colony PCR and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The Thermoascus crustaceus GH61A gene insert in pGH61 a51486 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer.      The same PCR fragment was cloned into pGEM-T vector using a pGEM-T Vector System to generate pGEM-T-GH61 a51486. The Thermoascus crustaceus GH61A gene insert in pGEM-T-GH61 a51486 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer. . coli strain T-51486A, designated NN059126, containing pGEM-T-GH61 a51486, was deposited at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSM), Mascheroder Braunschweig, Germany, on June 10, 2009, and assigned accession number DSM 22656.      Nucleotide sequence data were scrutinized for quality and all sequences were compared to each other with assistance of PHRED/PHRAP software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA).      The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the Thermoascus crustaceus gh61a gene are shown in SEQ ID NO: 191 and SEQ ID NO: 192, respectively. The coding sequence is 871 bp including the stop codon and is interrupted by one intron of 1 15 base pairs (nucleotides 105-219). The encoded predicted protein is 251 amino acids. The% G+C content of the full-length coding sequence and the mature coding sequence are 50.23% and 52.55%, respectively. Using the SignalP software program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1 -6), a signal peptide of 22 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 229 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 26.35 kDa.      Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422 and transformed with 3 of pGH61 a51486. The transformation yielded about 50 transformants. Twelve transformants were isolated to individual Minimal medium plates.      Four transformants were inoculated separately into 3 ml of YPM medium in a 24-well plate and incubated at 30C with shaking at 150 rpm. After 3 days incubation, 20  of supernatant from each culture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting gel was stained with INSTANT BLUE (Expedeon Ltd., Babraham Cambridge, UK). SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the majority of the transformants had a major band of approximately 30 kDa. The expression strain was designated Aspergillus oryzae EXP03151.      A slant of Aspergillus oryzae EXP03151 was washed with 10 ml of YPM medium and inoculated into a 2 liter flask containing 400 ml of YPM medium to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The culture was harvested on day 3 and filtered using a 0.45  DURAPORE Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).      The filtered broth was concentrated and buffer exchanged using a tangential flow concentrator equipped with a Sartocon Slice cassette with a 10kDa cut-off polyethersulfone membrane (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.0. The protein was applied to a Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0. The protein was recovered in the eluate. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 81 : Preparation of Talaromyces emersonii strain NN05002 GH10 xylanase The Talaromyces emersonii strain NN05002 GH10 xylanase (SEQ ID NO: 193 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 194 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to the procedure described below.      Talaromyces emersonii was grown on a PDA agar plate at 45C for 3 days. Mycelia were collected directly from the agar plate into a sterilized mortar and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Frozen mycelia were ground, by mortar and pestle, to a fine powder, and genomic     DNA was isolated using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit.      Oligonucleotide primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the GH10 xylanase gene from genomic DNA of Talaromyces emersonii. An IN-FUSION CF Dry-down Cloning     Kit was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector pPFJ0355, without the need for restriction digestion and ligation.      Sense primer:      5'-ACACAACTGGGGATCCACCATGGTTCGCCTCAGTCCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 282) Antisense primer:      5 -GTCACCCTCTAGATCTTTACAGACACTGCGAGTAATACTCATTG-3 (SEQ ID NO: 283)      Bold letters represented the coding sequence. The remaining sequence was homologous to the insertion sites of pPFJ0355.      Twenty picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction composed of Talaromyces emersonii genomic DNA, 10  I of 5X GC Buffer, 1.5  of DMSO, 5 mM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, and 0.6 unit of Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase in a final volume of 50 . The amplification was performed using a Peltier Thermal Cycler programmed for denaturing at 98C for 40 seconds; 8 cycles of denaturing at 98C for 15 seconds, annealing at 65C for 30 seconds, with a 1 C decrease per cycle and elongation at 72C for 80 seconds; and another 23 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 58C for 30 seconds and 72C for 80 seconds; final extension at 72C for 7 minutes. The heat block then went to a 10C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer where an approximately 1.4 kb product band was excised from the gel, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      Plasmid pPFJ0355 was digested with Bam I and Bgl II, isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer, and purified using an ILLUSTRA GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The gene fragment and the digested vector were ligated together using an INFUSION CF Dry-down PCR Cloning resulting in pxynTe50022 in which transcription of the Talaromyces emersonii GH10 xylanase gene was under the control of the Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase promoter. In brief, 20 ng of pPFJ0355 digested with Bam I and Bgl II, and 60 ng of the Talaromyces emersonii GH10 xylanase gene purified PCR product were added to a reaction vial and resuspended in a final volume of 10  with addition of deionized water. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes and then 50C for 15 minutes. Three  of the reaction were used to transform E. coli TOP10 competent cells. An E. coli transformant containing pxynTe50022 was detected by colony PCR and plasmid DNA was prepared using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit. The Talaromyces emersonii GH10 xylanase gene insert in pxynTe50022 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a 3730XL DNA Analyzer.      Aspergillus oryzae HowB101 (WO 95/35385) protoplasts were prepared according to the method of Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422 and transformed with 3 g of pxynTe50022. The transformation yielded about 50 transformants. Twelve transformants were isolated to individual Minimal medium plates. Four transformants were inoculated separately into 3 ml of YPM medium in a 24-well plate and incubated at 30C, 150 rpm. After 3 days incubation, 20  of supernatant from each culture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting gel was stained with INSTANT Blue. SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that the majority of the transformants had a major smeary band of approximately 55kDa. The expression strain was designated as A oryzae EXP03373.      A slant of A. oryzae EXP03373 was washed with 10 ml of YPM medium and inoculated into six 2 liter flasks, each containing 400 ml of YPM medium, to generate broth for characterization of the enzyme. The culture was harvested on day 3 by filtering the culture through MIRACLOTH (CALBIOCHEM, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA). The filtered culture broth was then again filtered using a 0.45  DURAPORE Membrane. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      A 1600 ml volume of filtered broth supernatant of A. oryzae EXP03373 was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation), re-dissolved in 100 ml of 25mM Bis- Tris pH 6.0, dialyzed against the same buffer, and filtered through a 0.45  filter; the final volume was 200 ml. The solution was applied to a 40 ml Q Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with 25 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, and the proteins were eluted with a linear NaCI gradient (0-0.4 M). Fractions with activity against AZCL-xylan were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a NUPAGE NOVEX 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel with MES buffer. Fractions with the correct molecular weight were pooled and concentrated by ultra filtration.      The supernatants were tested for endocellulase activity by microtiter plate assay as described below. A solution of 0.2% of the blue substrate AZCL-Xylan (Megazyme) was suspended in a 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) under stirring. The solution was distributed under stirring to a microtiter plate (200  to each well). Twenty  of enzyme sample was added and incubated in an EPPENDORF Thermomixer for 20 minutes at 50  C and 650 rpm. A denatured enzyme sample (100  C boiling for 20 minutes) was used as blank. After incubation the colored solution was separated from the solid by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4  C. Then 150  of supernatant was transferred to a microtiter plate and the absorbance was measured using a Spectra Max M2 at 595 nm.      Example 82: Preparation of Penicillium sp. Strain NN51602 GH10 xylanase      The Penicillium sp. strain NN51602 GH10 xylanase (SEQ ID NO: 195 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 196 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was obtained according to PCT/US 10/032034. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Example 83: Preparation of Meripilus giganteus strain CBS 521 ,95 GH10 xylanase      The Meripilus giganteus strain CBS 521 .95 GH10 xylanase (SEQ ID NO: 197 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 198 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was recombinantly prepared according to WO 97/27290 except Aspergillus oryzae Bech2 (WO 2000/39322) was used as a host and pDAu75 as the expression vector. Vector pDAu75 is a derivative of pJal721 (WO 03/008575). Plasmid pDAu75 mainly differs from pJal721 in that the selection marker URA3 of E. coli has been dirupted by the insertion of the ampicillin resistance gene E. coli beta lactamase, which allows for rapid selection of positive recombinant E. coli clones using commercially available and highly competent strains on commonly used LB ampicillin plates. The ampicillin resistance gene is entirely removable using the two flanking Not I sites restoring a functional selection marker URA3. The techniques used for making pDAu75 from pJal721 are common molecular biology techniques for DNA cloning. Cloning of the cDNA sequence of the Meripilus giganteus GH10 xylanase gene into pDAu75 was performed by a restriction/ligation cloning procedure from the xylanase producing yeast colony as described in WO 97/27290.      The broth was filtered using Whatmann glass filter GF/D, GF/A, GF/C, GF/F (2.7 , 1.6 , 1.2  and 0.7 , respectively) followed by filtration through a 0.45  filter.      Ammonia sulfate was added to the filtered broth to a final concentration of 3 M and the precipitate was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 30 minutes. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 mM Tris/HCI pH 8.0 and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris/HCI pH 8.0 overnight. The dialyzed preparation was applied to a 150 ml Q SEPHAROSE Fast Flow column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris/HCI pH 8.0 and the enzyme was eluted with a 1050 ml (7 column volumes) linear salt gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCI in 10 mM Tris/HCI pH 8.0. Elution was followed with A280 nm detection and fractions were collected and assayed for xylanase activity using 0.2% AZCL-Arabinoxylan from wheat (Megazyme) in 0.2 M sodium phosphate pH 6.0 plus 0.01 % TRITON X100. Fractions containing xylanase activity were pooled and stored at -20C. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 84: Preparation of Dictyoglomus thermophilum strain ATCC 35947 GH11 xylanase      The Dictyoglomus thermophilum GH1 1 xylanase (SEQ ID NO: 199 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 200 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was recombinantly prepared according to the following procedure.      Bacillus subtilis strains were made competent using the method described by Anagnostopoulos and Spizizen, 1961 , Journal of Bacteriology 81 : 741-746. DNA sequencing was conducted with an ABI 3700 Sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA).      Bacillus subtilis strain SM025 was constructed as described below to delete an intracellular serine protease (ispA) gene in Bacillus subtilis strain 16410 (Bindel-Connelly et ai, 2004, J. Bacteriol. 186: 4159-4167).      A deletion plasmid, pNNB194-/<'>spAA, was constructed by splicing by overlap extension (SOE) (Horton et ai, 1989, Gene 77: 61-8). Flanking DNA sequences 5' and 3' of the ispA gene were obtained by PCR amplification from chromosomal DNA derived from Bacillus subtilis strain 1645 (U.S. Patent No. 5,891 ,701 ) using primer pairs 994525/994526 and 994527/994528, respectively, shown below. Chromosomal DNA was obtained according to the procedure of Pitcher et ai, 1989, Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 8: 151-156.      Primer 994525:      5'-GGATCCATTATGTAGGGCGTAAAGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 284)      Primer 994526:      5'-TTAGCAAGCTTAATCACTTTAATGCCCTCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 285)      Primer 994527:      5'-TGATTAAGCTTGCTAATCCGCAGGACACTTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 286)      Primer 994528:      5'-GGTACCAACACTGCCTCTCTCATCTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 287)      PCR amplifications were conducted in 50  reactions composed of 10 ng of Bacillus subtilis strain 1645 chromosomal DNA, 0.4  of each primer, 200  each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1X PCR Buffer II (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) with 2.5 mM MgCI2, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq GOLD DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). The reactions were performed in a ROBOCYCLER 40 Temperature Cycler (Stratagene, Corp., La Jolla, CA, USA) programmed for 1 cycle at 95C for 10 minutes; 25 cycles each at 95C for 1 minute, 50C for 1 minute, and 72C for 1 minute; and 1 cycle at 72C for 7 minutes.      The PCR products were resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using 0.5X TBE buffer (50 mM Tris base-50 mM boric acid-1 mM disodium EDTA). A band of approximately 400 bp obtained using the primer pair 994525/994526 for the 5' flanking DNA sequence of the ispA gene was excised from the gel and extracted using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). A band of approximately 400 bp obtained using the primer pair 994527/994528 for the 3' flanking DNA sequence of the ispA gene was excised from the gel and extracted using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit.      The final SOE fragment was amplified using the same procedure above with the 400 bp fragments as templates and primers 994525 and 994528, shown above, to produce an ispA deletion fragment. The PCR product of approximately 800 kb was resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using 0.5X TBE buffer.      The final 800 kb SOE fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,     USA) using a TA-TOPO Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and transformed into     ONE SHOT TOP10 Chemically Competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformants were selected on 2X YT agar plates supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml and incubated at 37C for 16 hours.     The DNA sequence of the cloned fragment was verified by DNA sequencing with M13 forward and reverse primers (Invitrogen, Inc, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The plasmid was designated pCR2.1-/<'>spAA.      Plasmid pCR2.1-/<'>spAA was digested with Bam HI and >Asp718 and subjected to 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using 0.5X TBE buffer to isolate the ispA deletion fragment. A     800 bp fragment corresponding to the ispA deletion fragment was excised from the gel and extracted using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit.      The temperature sensitive plasmid pNNB194 (pSK7pE194; U.S. Patent No. 5,958,728) was digested with Bam HI and Asp7'\ 8 and resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using 0.5X TBE buffer to isolate the vector fragment. A 6600 bp vector fragment of pNNB194 was excised from the gel and extracted using a QIAQUICK Gel     Extraction Kit.      The ispA deletion fragment and the pNNB194 fragment were ligated together using a Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and the ligation mix was transformed into E. coli SURE cells (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA, USA) selecting for ampicillin resistance according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was isolated from eight transformants using a BIOROBOT 9600, digested with Bam HI and >Asp718, and analyzed by agarose electrophoresis as described above to identify plasmids which harbored the ispAA fragment. One transformant was identified and designated pNNB194-/spAA.      Plasmid pNNB194-/<'>spAA was introduced into Bacillus subtilis 16410 (Bindel- Connelly et ai, 2004, J. Bacteriol. 186: 4159-4167) and integrated at the ispA locus by selective growth at 45C on Tryptose blood agar base (TBAB) plates supplemented with 1 g of erythromycin and 25 g of lincomycin per ml. The integrated plasmid was then excised by non-selective growth on LB medium at 34C. Chromosomal DNA was isolated from several erythromycin sensitive clones according to the method of Pitcher et al., 1989, supra, and analyzed by PCR using primers 994525 and 994528 using the same method above to confirm the presence of the ispA deletion. One such clone was designated Bacillus subtilis SM025.      A linear integration vector-system was used for the expression cloning of a synthetic Dictyoglomus thermophilum Family 1 1 xylanase gene without a binding domain and without a signal peptide. The synthetic gene sequence was based on the public gene sequence UNIPROT: P77853. The synthetic gene was codon optimized for expression in Bacillus subtilis following recommendations by Gustafsson et al., 2004, Trends in Biotechnology 22: 346-353. The synthetic gene was generated by DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, CA, USA) and delivered as a cloned fragment in their standard cloning vector (kanamycin resistant). The xylanase gene was cloned as a truncated gene without binding domain and with the signal peptide from Bacillus clausii serine protease gene (ap/, SAVINASE, Novo Nordisk A S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) (included in the flanking region). The gene was designed to contain a C-terminal HQHQHQHQP tag to ease purification. The forward primer was designed so the gene was amplified from the signal peptide cleavage site and it had 26 bases overhang (shown in italic in the table below). This overhang was complementary to part of one of the two linear vector fragments and was used when the PCR fragment and the vector fragments were assembled (described below). The reverse primer was designed to amplify the truncated version of the gene and contained an overhang consisting of 30 bp encoding a HQHQHQHQP-tag and a stop codon (the overhang is shown in italic in the table below). This overhang was complementary to part of one of the two linear vector fragments and was used when the PCR fragment and the vector fragments were assembled (described below).      The linear integration construct was a PCR fusion product made by fusion of each gene between two Bacillus subtils homologous chromosomal regions along with a strong promoter and a chloramphenicol resistance marker. The fusion was made by splicing by overlap extension (SOE) (Horton et al., 1989, supra). The SOE PCR method is also described in WO 2003/095658. Each gene was expressed under the control of a triple promoter system (described in WO 99/43835), consisting of the promoters from Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene (amyL), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene (amyQ), and the Bacillus thuringiensis crylllA promoter including the mRNA stabilizing sequence. The gene coding for chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase was used as marker (described, for example, by Diderichsen et al., 1993, Plasmid 30: 312). The final gene construct was integrated by homologous recombination into the pectate lyase locus of the Bacillus chromosome.      The GH1 1 xylanase gene was amplified from plasmid 7587 by PCR using the primers shown in the Table below 1 below. The plasmid 7587 contains the synthetic Dictyoglomus thermophilum GH1 1 xylanase gene (SEQ ID NO: 304 for the DNA sequence and SEQ ID NO: 305 for the deduced amino acid sequence) without a binding domain and without a signal peptide.      Three fragments were PCR amplified to make the construct: the gene fragment containing the truncated xylanase gene and the 26 bp and 30 bp flanking DNA sequences included in the primers as overhang, the upstream flanking fragment (including a signal peptide from Savinase and amplified with the primers 260558 and iMB1361 Uni2) and the downstream flanking fragment (amplified with the primers 260559 and HQHQHQHQP-f). The flanking fragments were amplified from genomic DNA of the strain iMB1361 (described in patent application WO 2003/095658). All primers used are listed in the Table 1 below.      The gene fragment was amplified using a proofreading polymerase PHUSION     DNA Polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions. The two flanking DNA fragments were amplified with ""Expand High Fidelity PCR System"" (Roche-Applied-Science) according to standard procedures (following the manufacturer's recommendations). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94C for 2 minutes followed by 10 cycles of (94C for 15 seconds, 50C for 45 seconds, 68C for 4 minutes) followed by 20 cycles of (94C for 15 seconds, 50C for 45 seconds, 68C for 4 minutes (+20 seconds extension per cycle)) and ending with one cycle at 68C for 10 min. The 3 PCR fragments were subjected to a subsequent Splicing by Overlap Extension (SOE) PCR reaction to assemble the 3 fragments into one linear vector construct. This was pereformed by mixing the 3 fragments in equal molar ratios and a new PCR reaction were run under the following conditions: initial 2 minutes, at 94C, followed by 10 cycles of (94C for 15 seconds, 50C for 45 seconds, 68C for 5 minutes), 10 cycles of (94C for 15 seconds, 50C for 45 seconds, 68C for 8 minutes), 15 cycles of (94C for 15 seconds, 50C for 45 seconds, 68C for 8 minutes in addition 20 seconds extra per cycle). After the 1 <st> cycle the two end primers 260558 and 260559 were added (20 pMol of each). Two  of the PCR product were transformed into Bacillus subtilis. Transformants were selected on LB plates supplemented with 6 g of chloramphenicol per ml. The truncated xylanase construct was integrated by homologous recombination into the genome of the Bacillus subtilis host PL4250 (AprE-, NprE-, SrfC-, SpollAC-, AmyE-, comS+). One transformant, EXP01955, was selected for further work. The xylanase coding region was sequenced in this transformant. It contained one mutation leading to a change of the HQHQHQHQP-tag to a HQHQHQHQQ-tag) but no other mutations were observed.      Table 1.

Chromosomal DNA was obtained according to the procedure of Pitcher et al., 1989, supra.      Primer 062405:      5'-GAGCTCTATAAAAATGAGGAGGGAACCGAATGAAGAAACC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 294) Primer 062406:      5'-ACGCGTTTAGCTGCCCTGAGAGAAAGTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 295)      The PCR amplifications were conducted in 50  reactions composed of 10 ng of B. subtilis EXP01955 chromosomal DNA, 0.4  of each primer, 200  each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1X PCR Buffer II with 2.5 mM MgCI2, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq GOLD DNA Polymerase. The reactions were performed in a ROBOCYCLER 40 Temperature Cycler programmed for 1 cycle at 95C for 10 minutes; 25 cycles each at 95C for 1 minute, 50C for 1 minute, and 72C for 1 minute; and 1 cycle at 72C for 7 minutes. A PCR product of approximately 740 kb of the truncated xylanase gene was resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using 0.5X TBE buffer, excised from the gel, and extracted using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit.      The 740 kb fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 using a TA-TOPO Cloning Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions and transformed into ONE SHOT TOP10 Chemically Competent E. coli cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformants were selected on 2X YT agar plates supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml and incubated at 37C for 16 hours. The DNA sequence of the cloned fragment was verified by DNA sequencing with M13 forward and reverse primers. The plasmid was designated pCR2.1-Dt xyl.      DNA sequencing revealed that there was an extra G at position 19 of the sequence encoding the aprH signal sequence. A QUIKCHANGE XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene Corp., La Jolla, CA, USA) was utilized to correct the mistake in plasmid pCR2.1- Dt xyl using the following primers to delete the extra G residue:      Primer 062535:      5'-CCGTTGGGGAAAATTGTCGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 296)      Primer 062536:      5'-GCGACAATTTTCCCCAACGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 297)      The kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions and the change was successfully made resulting in plasmid pCR2.1-Dt xyl2.      Plasmid pCR2.1 -Dt xyl2 and pMDT100 WO 2008/140615 were digested with Sac I and Mlu I. The digestions were each resolved by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis using 0.5X TBE buffer. A vector fragment of approximately 8.0 kb from pMDT100 and a xylanase gene fragment of approximately 700 bp from pCR2.1-Dt xyl2 were excised from the gels and extracted using a QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit. The two purified fragments were ligated together using a Rapid DNA Ligation Kit.      Competent cells of Bacillus subtilis 1684 were transformed with the ligation products according to the method of Young and Spizizen, 1961 , Journal of Bacteriology 81 : 823-829, or Dubnau and Davidoff-Abelson, 1971 , Journal of Molecular Biology 56: 209-221. Bacillus subtilis 1684 is derived from the Bacillus subtilis type strain 168 (BGSC 1A1 , Bacillus Genetic Stock Center, Columbus, OH, USA) and has deletions in the spollAC, ap/, nprE, and amyE genes. The deletion of the four genes was performed essentially as described for Bacillus subtilis 1645 (U.S. Patent No. 5,891 ,701 ).      Bacillus subtilis transformants were selected at 37C after 16 hours of growth on TBAB plates supplemented with 5 g of chloramphenicol per ml. To screen for integration of the plasmid by double cross-over at the amyE locus, Bacillus subtilis primary transformants were patched onto TBAB plates supplemented with 6 g of neomycin per ml and onto TBAB plates supplemented with 5 g of chloramphenicol per ml. Integration of the plasmid by double cross-over at the amyE locus does not incorporate the neomycin resistance gene and therefore renders the strain neomycin sensitive. A chloramphenicol resistant, neomycin sensitive transformant was identified, which harbored the Dictyoglomus thermophilum xylanase expression cassette in the amyE locus, and designated Bacillus subtilis 168 with pSM0271 .      Genomic DNA was isolated from Bacillus subtilis 168 with pSM0271 (Pitcher et al., 1989, supra) and 0.1 g was transformed into competent Bacillus subtilis SM025. Transformants were selected on TBAB plates supplemented with 5 g of chloramphenicol per ml at 37C. A chloramphenicol resistant transformant was single colony purified and designated Bacillus subtilis SM047.      The Bacillus subtilis strain designated SM047 was streaked on agar slants and incubated for about 24 hours at 37C. The agar medium was composed per liter of 10 g of soy peptone, 10 g of sucrose, 2 g of trisodium citrate dihydrate, 4 g of KH2P04, 5 g of Na2HP04, 15 g of Bacto agar, 0.15 mg of biotin, 2 ml of trace metals, and deionized water to 1 liter. The trace metals solution was composed of 1.59 g of ZnS04 -7 H20, 0.76 g of CuSCy5 H20, 7.52 g of FeSCy7 H20, 1.88 g of MnS04-H20, 20 g of citric acid, and deionized water to 1 liter. Approximately 15 ml of sterile buffer (7.0 g of Na2HP04, 3.0 g of KH2P04, 4.0 g of NaCI, 0.2 g of MgS04-7 H20, and deionized water to 1 liter) was used to gently wash off some of the cells from the agar surface. The bacterial suspension was then used for inoculation of baffled shake flasks containing 100 ml of growth medium composed of 1 1 g of soy bean meal, 0.4 g of Na2HP04, 5 drops of antifoam, and deionized water to 100 ml. The inoculated shake flasks were incubated at 37C for about 20 hours with shaking at 300 rpm, after which 100 ml (obtained by combining the media from two independent shake flasks with the same strain) were used for inoculation of a 3 liter fermentor with 900 ml of medium composed of 40 g of hydrolyzed potato protein, 6 g of K2S04, 4 g of Na2HP04, 12 g of K2HP04, 4 g of (NH4)2S04, 0.5 g of CaC03, 2 g of citric acid; 4 g of MgS04, 40 ml of trace metals solution (described above), 1 mg of biotin (biotin was added as 1 ml of a 1 g per liter biotin solution in the buffer described above), 1 .3 ml of antifoam, and deionized water to 1 liter. The medium was adjusted to pH 5.25 with phosphoric acid prior to being autoclaved.      The fermentation was carried out as a fed-batch fermentation with sucrose solution being the feed. The fermentation temperature was held constant at 37C. The tanks were aerated with 3 liter air per minute, and the agitation rate was held in the range of 1 ,500-1 ,800 rpm. The fermentation time was around 60-70 hours. The pH was maintained in the range of pH 6.5-7.3.      The fermentation was assayed for xylanase activity according to the following procedure. Culture supernatants were diluted appropriately in 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0. A purified Dictyoglomus thermophilum xylanase was diluted using 2-fold steps starting with a 1.71 g ml concentration and ending with a 0.03 g /ml concentration in the sample buffer. A total of 40  of each dilution including standard was transferred to a 96-well flat bottom plate. Using a Biomek NX (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton CA, USA), a 96-well pippetting workstation, 40  an Azo-Wheat arabinoxylan (Megazyme International, Ireland) substrate solution (1 % w/v) was added to each well then incubated at 50C for 30 minutes. Upon completion of the incubation the reaction was stopped with 200  of ethanol (95% v/v). The samples were then incubated at ambient temperatures for 5 minutes followed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes. One hundred-fifty microliters of the supernatant was removed and dispensed into a new 96-well flat bottom plate. An optical density of 590 nm was obtained for the 96-well plate using a SPECTRAMAX 250 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnvale CA, USA). Sample concentrations were determined by extrapolation from the generated standard curve.      Filtrated broth was added to 2% v/v GC-850 (Gulbrandsen, SC, USA) followed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 20 minutes. The supernatant was again added 2% v/v GC- 850 followed by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 20 minutes. The supernatant was concentrated using a tangential flow concentrator equipped with a Sartocon Slice cassette with a 10 kDa MW-CO polyethersulfone membrane. The concentrate was 80C treated for 30 minutes and filtrated through a 1.2  glass microfibre filter (Whatman, International Ltd, Maidstone, England). The pH was adjusted to pH 8.0 and loaded onto a MEP HyperCel (Pall Corporation, East Hills, NY USA) column. The bound proteins were eluted with 50 mM acetic acid pH 4.5. The eluted proteins were stirred with activated carbon 1 % w/v (Picatif FGV 120, Pica, France) for 15 minutes and filtrated on 0.2  PES filter (Nalge Nunc International, New York, NY USA). The pH was adjusted to pH 5.0 using 3 M Tris. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 85: Preparation of Aspergillus aculeatus strain CBS 172.66 GH3 beta- xylosidase      The Aspergillus aculeatus strain CBS 172.66 GH beta-xylosidase (SEQ ID NO: 201 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 202 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was recombinantly prepared according to the following procedure.      Aspergillus aculeatus CBS 172.66 was used as the source of the polypeptide having beta-xylosidase activity.      Genomic sequence information was generated by the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI). A preliminary assembly of the genome was downloaded from JGI and analyzed using the Pedant-Pro Sequence Analysis Suite (Biomax Informatics AG, Martinsried, Germany). Gene models constructed by the software were used as a starting point for detecting GH3 homologues in the genome. More precise gene models were constructed manually using multiple known GH3 protein sequences as a guide.      To generate genomic DNA for PCR amplification, Aspergillus aculeatus CBS 172.66 was propagated on PDA agar plates by growing at 26C for 7 days. Spores harvested from the PDA plates were used to inoculate 25 ml of YP+2% glucose medium in a baffled shake flask and incubated at 26C for 48 hours with agitation at 200 rpm. Genomic DNA was isolated according to a modified FastDNA SPIN protocol (Qbiogene, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly a FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil (Qbiogene, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used in a FastPrep 24 Homogenization System (MP Biosciences, Santa Ana, CA, USA). Two ml of fungal material from the above cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 2 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in 500  of deionized water. The suspension was transferred to a Lysing Matrix E FastPrep tube (Qbiogene, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 790  of sodium phosphate buffer and 100  of MT buffer from the FastDNA SPIN Kit were added to the tube. The sample was then secured in the FastPrep Instrument (Qbiogene, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) and processed for 60 seconds at a speed of 5.5 m/sec. The sample was then centrifuged at 14,000 x g for two minutes and the supernatant transferred to a clean EPPENDORF tube. A 250  volume of PPS reagent from the FastDNA SPIN Kit was added and then the sample was mixed gently by inversion. The sample was again centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to a 15 ml tube followed by 1 ml of Binding Matrix suspension from the FastDNA SPIN Kit and then mixed by inversion for two minutes. The sample was placed in a stationary tube rack and the silica matrix was allowed to settle for 3 minutes. A 500  volume of the supernatant was removed and discarded and then the remaining sample was resuspended in the matrix. The sample was then transferred to a SPIN filter tube from the FastDNA SPIN Kit and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 1 minute. The catch tube was emptied and the remaining matrix suspension added to the SPIN filter tube. The sample was again centrifuged (14,000 x g, 1 minute). A 500  volume of SEWS-M solution from the FastDNA SPIN Kit was added to the SPIN filter tube and the sample was centrifuged at the same speed for 1 minute. The catch tube was emptied and the SPIN filter replaced in the catch tube. The unit was centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 2 minutes to ""dry"" the matrix of residual SEWS-M wash solution. The SPIN filter was placed in a fresh catch tube and allowed to air dry for 5 minutes at room temperature. The matrix was gently resuspended in 100  of DES (DNase/Pyrogen free water) with a pipette tip. The unit was centrifuged (14,000 x g, 1 minute) to elute the genomic DNA followed by elution with 100  of 10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 by renewed centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 1 minute and the eluates were combined. The concentration of the DNA harvested from the catch tube was measured by a UV spectrophotometer at 260 nm.      Synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below are designed to PCR amplify Aspergillus aculeatus CBS 172.66 GH3 genes from the genomic DNA prepared in Example 2. An IN-FUSION Cloning Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) is used to clone the fragments directly into the expression vector pDau109 (WO 2005/042735).      Primer GH3-1 14f: 5'-ACACAACTGGGGATCCACCATGGCTGTGGCGGCTCTT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 298)      Primer GH3-1 14r:      5'-AGATCTCGAGAAGCTTACTACTCATCCCCCTGCAC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 299)      PCR reactions are carried out with genomic DNA prepared from Example 2 for amplification of the genes identified in Example 1 . The PCR reaction is composed of 1  of genomic DNA, 1  of primer forward (f) (50 ); 1  of primer reverse (r) (50 ); 10  of 5X HF buffer, 2  of 10 mM dNTP; 1  of PHUSION DNA polymerase, and PCR-grade water up to 50 . Primers GH3-1 14f and GH3-1 14r are used simultaneously.      The PCR reactions are performed using a DYAD PCR machine programmed for 2 minutes at 98C followed by 20 touchdown cycles at 98C for 15 seconds, 70C (-1 C/cycle) for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds; and 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 60C for 30 seconds, 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds; and 5 minutes at 72C.      The reaction products are isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using 40 mM Tris base, 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM disodium EDTA (TAE) buffer where approximately 2.5 to 3.0 kb PCR product bands are excised from the gels and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. DNA corresponding to the A. aculeatus GH3 genes are cloned into the expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005042735) linearized with Bam HI and Hind III, using an IN-FUSION Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      A 2.5  volume of the five times diluted ligation mixture is used to transform E. coli     TOP10 chemically competent cells. Five colonies are selected on LB agar plates containing 100 g of ampicillin per ml and cultivated overnight in 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. Plasmid DNA is purified using an E.Z.N.A.<> Plasmid Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Aspergillus aculeatus GH3 gene sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing with an Applied Biosystems Model 3700 Automated DNA Sequencer using version 3.1 BIG-DYE terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). Nucleotide sequence data are scrutinized for quality and all sequences are compared to each other with assistance of PHRED/PHRAP software (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA).      The coding sequence is 2412 bp including the stop codon and contains no introns. The encoded predicted protein is 803 amino acids. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, supra), a signal peptide of 17 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 786 amino acids.      Spores of the best transformant were spread on COVE plates containing 0.01 %     TRITON X-100 in order to isolate single colonies. The spreading was repeated twice in total on COVE sucrose medium (Cove, 1996, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 133: 51 -56) containing 1 M sucrose and 10 mM sodium nitrate, supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCI. Fermentation was then carried out in 250 ml shake flasks using DAP-2C-1 medium for 4 days at 30C with shaking at 100 rpm. The fermentation broth was filtered using standard methods.      Ammonium sulphate was added to the filtrated broth to a consentration of 2 M. After filtration using a 0.2  PES filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark), the filtrate was loaded onto a Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (high sub) (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 with 2 M ammonium sulphate, and bound proteins were eluted with 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0 with no ammonium sulphate. The fractions were pooled and applied to a Sephadex G-25 (medium) (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) column equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0. The fractions were pooled and then applied to a SOURCE 15Q (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) column equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0-1000 mM sodium chloride. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 86: Preparation of Aspergillus aculeatus strain CBS 186.67 GH3 beta- xylosidase      The Aspergillus aculeatus strain CBS 186.67 GH3 beta-xylosidase (SEQ ID NO: 203     [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 204 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was recombinantly prepared according to the following procedure.      Genomic DNA was isolated according to the procedure described in Example 73. The Aspergillus aculeatus beta-xylosidase gene was isolated by PCR using two cloning primers GH3-101f and GH3-101 r, shown below, which were designed based on the publicly available Aspergillus aculeatus xyl2 full-length sequence (GenBank AB462375.1 ) for direct cloning using the IN-FUSION strategy.      Primer GH3-101f:      5'-acacaactggggatccaccatggctgtggcggctcttgctctgctgg-3' (SEQ ID NO: 300)      Primer GH3-101 r:      5'-agatctcgagaagcttaCTCATCCCCCGCCACCCCCTGCACCTCC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 301 )      A PCR reaction was performed with genomic DNA prepared from Aspergillus aculeatus CBS 186.67 in order to amplify the full-length gene. The PCR reaction was composed of 1  of genomic DNA, 0.75  of primer GH3-101.1f (10 ), 0.75  of primer GH3-101.1 r (10 ), 3  of 5X HF buffer, 0.25  of 50 mM MgCI2, 0.3  of 10 mM dNTP, 0.15  of PHUSION DNA polymerase, and PCR-grade water up to 15 . The PCR reaction was performed using a DYAD PCR machine programmed for 2 minutes at 98C followed by 10 touchdown cycles at 98C for 15 seconds, 70C (-1 C/cycle) for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds; and 25 cycles each at 98C for 15 seconds, 60C for 30 seconds, 72C for 2 minutes 30 seconds, and 5 minutes at 72C.      The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer where an approximately 2.4 kb PCR product band was excised from the gel and purified using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit according to manufacturer's instructions. DNA corresponding to the Aapergillus aculeatus beta-xylosidase gene was cloned into the expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005042735) linearized with Bam HI and Hind III, using an IN-FUSION Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.      A 2.5  volume of the diluted ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli TOP10 chemically competent cells. Three colonies were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 g of ampicillin per ml and cultivated overnight in 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 g of ampicillin per ml. Plasmid DNA was purified using an E.Z.N.A.<> Plasmid Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Aspergillus aculeatus beta-xylosidase gene sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing before heterologous expression.      The coding sequence is 2454 bp including the stop codon. The gene does not contain introns. The encoded predicted protein is 817 amino acids. Using the SignalP program (Nielsen et al., 1997, Protein Engineering 10: 1-6), a signal peptide of 17 residues was predicted. The predicted mature protein contains 800 amino acids.      Protoplasts of Aspergillus oryzae MT3568 were prepared as described in WO 95/02043. A. oryzae MT3568 is an amdS (acetamidase) disrupted gene derivative of Aspergillus oryzae JaL355 (WO 2002/40694) in which pyrG auxotrophy was restored by disrupting the A. oryzae acetamidase (amdS) gene with the pyrG gene. One hundred microliters of protoplast suspension were mixed with 2.5-15 g of the Aspergillus expression vector and 250  of 60% PEG 4000, 10 mM CaCI2, and 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5 were added and gently mixed. The mixture was incubated at 37C for 30 minutes and the protoplasts were spread on COVE sucrose (1 M) plates supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCI for transformant selection. After incubation for 4-7 days at 37C spores of several transformants were seeded on YP-2% maltodextrin medium. After 4 days cultivation at 30C culture broth was analyzed in order to identify the best transformants based on their ability to produce a large amount of active Aculeatus aculeatus beta-xylosidase. The screening was based on intensity of the band corresponding to the heterologous expressed protein determined by SDS-PAGE and activity of the enzyme on 4-nitrophenyl-beta-D- xylopyranoside (pNPX) as follows. Ten  of culture broth was mixed with 90  of assay reagent containing 10  of 0.1 % TWEEN 20, 10  of 1 M sodium citrate pH 5, 4  of 100 mM of pNPX substrate (Sigma Aldrich) solubilized in DMSO (0.4% final volume in stock solution), and filtered water. The assay was performed for 30 minutes at 37C and absorbance dertermined at 405 nm before and after addition of 100  of 1 M sodium carbonate pH 10. The highest absorbance values at 405 nm were correlated to the SDS- PAGE data for selection of the best transformant.      Spores of the best transformant designated A. oryzae EXP361 1 were spread on     COVE plates containing 0.01 % TRITON X-100 in order to isolate single colonies. The spreading was repeated twice in total on COVE sucrose medium (Cove, 1996, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 133: 51-56) containing 1 M sucrose and 10 mM sodium nitrate, supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCI. Fermentation was then carried out in 250 ml shake flasks using DAP-4C-1 medium for 4 days at 30C with shaking at 100 rpm. The fermentation broth was filtered using standard methods. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard. Example 87: Preparation of Aspergillus fumigatus strain NN051616 GH3 beta- xylosidase Q0H905      The Aspergillus fumigatus strain NN051616 GH3 beta-xylosidase (SEQ ID NO: 205 [DNA sequence] and SEQ ID NO: 206 [deduced amino acid sequence]) was recombinantly prepared according to the following procedure.      Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers shown below were designed to PCR amplify the Aspergillus fumigatus beta xylosidase gene from the genomic DNA. An InFusion Cloning Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used to clone the fragment directly into the expression vector, pAILo2 (WO 2005/074647), without the need for restriction digests and ligation.      Forward primer:      5' -ACT G G ATTTAC C ATG G CGG TTG CC AAATCT ATTG CT -3' (SEQ ID NO: 302)      Reverse primer:      5'-TCACCTCTAGTTAATTAATCACGCAGACGAAATCTGCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 303)      Bold letters represent coding sequence. The remaining sequence is homologous to the insertion sites of pAILo2.      Fifteen picomoles of each of the primers above were used in a PCR reaction containing 250 ng of Aspergillus fumigatus genomic DNA, 1 X Expand High Fidelity Buffer with MgCI2 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), 1  of 10 mM blend of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 0.75 units of Expand High fidelity Enzyme Mix (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), in a final volume of 50 . The amplification conditions were one cycle at 94C for 2 minutes; 10 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 56.5C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes; and 20 cycles each at 94C for 15 seconds, 56.5C for 30 seconds, and 72C for 2 minutes plus 5 seconds per successive cycle. The heat block was then held at 72C for 7 minutes followed by a 4C soak cycle.      The reaction products were isolated on a 1.0% agarose gel using TAE buffer and a 2.4 kb product band was excised from the gel and purified using a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.      The fragment was then cloned into pAILo2 using an InFusion Cloning Kit. The vector was digested with Nco I and Pac I (using conditions specified by the manufacturer). The fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis and QIAquick kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) gel purification. The gene fragment and the digested vector were combined together in a reaction resulting in the expression plasmid pAG57, in which transcription of the Aspergillus fumigatus beta-xylosidase gene was under the control of the NA2-tpi promoter (a hybrid of the promoters from the genes for Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase and Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase). The recombination reaction (20 ) was composed of 1 X InFusion Buffer (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) , 1X BSA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) , 1  of InFusion enzyme (diluted 1 :10) (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) , 182 ng of pAILo2 digested with Nco I and Pac I, and 97.7 ng of the Aspergillus fumigatus beta-xylosidase purified PCR product. The reaction was incubated at 37C for 15 minutes followed by 15 minutes at 50C. The reaction was diluted with 40  of TE buffer and 2.5  of the diluted reaction was used to transform E. coli Top10 Competent cells. An E. coli transformant containing pAG57 (Aspergillus fumigatus beta-xylosidase gene) was identified by restriction enzyme digestion and plasmid DNA was prepared using a BIOROBOT 9600. The pAG57 plasmid construct was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 3130x1 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to verify the sequence.      Aspergillus oryzae Jal_355 protoplasts were prepared according to the method of     Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422 and tansformed with 5 g of pAG57. Twenty-four transformants were isolated to individual PDA plates.      Plugs taken from the original transformation plate of each of the twenty-four transformants were added to 1 ml of M410 separately in 24 well plates, which were incubated at 34C. After three days of incubation, 7.5  of supernatant from each culture was analyzed using Criterion stain-free, 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE, (BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE profiles of the cultures showed that several transformants had a new major band of approximately 130 kDa.      Confluent PDA plate of the highest expressing transformant was washed with 5 ml of 0.01 % TWEEN 20 and inoculated into a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of M410 medium. Inoculated flask was incubated with shaking for 3 days at 34C. The broth was filtered through a 0.22  stericup suction filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA).      Filtered broth was concentrated and buffer exchanged using a tangential flow concentrator (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA, USA) equipped with a 10 kDa polyethersulfone membrane (Pall Filtron, Northborough, MA, USA) with 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0. Protein concentration was determined using a Microplate BCA Protein Assay Kit in which bovine serum albumin was used as a protein standard.      Example 88: Evaluation of two cellobiohydrolases I replacing a CBHI component in a high-temperature enzyme composition in saccharification of milled unwashed PCS at 50-65C      The ability of two cellobiohydrolase I proteins to replace a CBHI component in a high- temperature enzyme composition (3 mg total protein per g cellulose) was tested at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The high-temperature enzyme composition included 37% CBHI, 25% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel6A CBHI I, 10% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 15% Penicillium sp. GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta-glucosidase, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xyn3 xylanase, and 3% Trichoderma reesei GH3 beta- xylosidase.      The following CBHIs were each tested in the high-temperature enzyme composition: Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and Penicillium emersonii Cel7A CBHI.      The assay was performed as described in Example 34. The 1 ml reactions with milled unwashed PCS (5% insoluble solids) were conducted for 72 hours in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 buffer containing 1 mM manganese sulfate. All reactions were performed in triplicate and involved single mixing at the beginning of hydrolysis.      As shown in Figure 29, Penicillium emersonii Cel7A CBHI performed the same as     Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI at 50C and performed better than Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI at 55-65C (as the degree of cellulose conversion to glucose was higher for Penicillium emersonii Cel7A CBHI than Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI at 55-65C). Example 89: Evaluation of two cellobiohydrolases I replacing a CBHI component in a high-temperature enzyme composition in saccharification of milled unwashed PCS at 50-65C      The ability of two cellobiohydrolase I proteins to replace a CBHI component in a high- temperature enzyme composition (3 mg total protein per g cellulose) was tested at 50C, 55C, 60C, and 65C using milled unwashed PCS as a substrate. The high-temperature enzyme composition included 40% CBHI, 25% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel6A CBHII, 10% Myceliophthora thermophila Cel5A EGII, 15% Thermoascus aurantiacus GH61A polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity, 5% Aspergillus fumigatus GH10 xylanase, and 5% Aspergillus fumigatus Cel3A beta-glucosidase.      The following CBHIs were each tested in the high-temperature enzyme composition: Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI and Penicillium pinophilum Cel7A CBHI. The high- temperature composition including Aspergillus fumigatus Cel7A CBHI was loaded at 3.3 mg total protein per gram cellulose instead of 3 mg total protein per gram cellulose, in which Penicillium pinophilum Cel7A CBHI was loaded.
