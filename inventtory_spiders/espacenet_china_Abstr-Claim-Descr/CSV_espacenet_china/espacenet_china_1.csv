The invention further provides resin formulations useful in the production of the prepregs.      Composite materials have well-documented advantages over traditional construction materials, particularly in providing excellent mechanical properties at very low material densities. As a result, the use of such materials is becoming increasingly widespread and their fields of application range from ""industrial"" to high performance aerospace components including aircraft fuselages.      Prepregs. comprising a fibre arrangement impregnated with resin such as epoxy resin, are widely used in the generation of such composite materials. Typically a number of plies of such prepregs are ""laid-up"" as desired and the resulting laminate is cured, typically by exposure to elevated temperatures, to produce a cured composite laminate. The term prepreg is used to describe fibres and fabric impregnated with a resin in the unciired or partially cured state and ready for curing. The fibres may be in the form of tows or fabrics and a tow generally comprises a plurality of thin fibres, the fibrous materials may be of carbon fibre, glass or aramid, this invention is particularly concerned with carbon fibre. The chemical composition of the resins employed in the prepregs will depend upon the piOperties required of the cured fibre reinforced material and also the use to which the cured material is to be put. Prepregs are typically prepared by the deposition of a liquid resin composition onto a moving layer of fibrous material and compressing the liquid resin into the fibrous material whilst, at the same time, forming a layer of the resin on the surface of the fibrous material The resin composition may be applied to one or both sides of the layer of fibrous material. The term ""interlayer ' is used herein to describe a resin layer between two fibrous layers. Composite materials is the term used to describe cured prepregs i.e. where the resm has been cured and composites are often made up from a laminate of a plurality of prepreg layers laid up on top of one another. This results in a laminate structure of fibre   arrangements separated by resin inteiieafs or resin inter layers. The interlayers typically comprise cured epoxy resins which are poor conductors of electricity. Although the fibres particularly carbon fibres have some electrical conductivity, the presence of the interleaf iiiterlayers means that conductivity is exhibited only in the plane of the laminate. The electrical conductivity in the direction orthogonal to the surface of the laminate, the so- called ""Z"" direction, is low.      This lack -of conductivity in the ""Z"" direc tion contiibutes to the wlnerabili y of composite laminates to electromagnetic hazards -such as lightning strikes. A lightning strike can cause damage to the composite material which can be quite extensive, and could be catastrophic if occurring on an aircraft structure in flight This is <'>therefore a particular problem for aerospace <'>structures, particularly aircraft structures made from such composite materials.      Additionally composites for use in aerospace applications must meet exacting standards on mechanical properties. Thus, any improvements in conductivity must not impact negatively on the required mechanical properties.      A wide range of techniques and methods have been suggested to provide lightning strike protection to such composite materials. There have been many suggestions involving the addition of conductive elements at the expense of increasing the weight of the composite material.      There have been man}? proposals to use electrically conducting particles including carbon particles to increase the electrical conductivity of fibre reinforced composites. For example, WO2011/027160; WO2011/114140 and WO2010/150022 are all concerned with increasing the eieciiical conductivity of carbon fibre reinforced composites such as carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resins. They are in particular concerned with increasing the electrical conductivity in the ""Z"" direction and disclose that conductive particles such as carbon particles may be included in the thermosetting resin to increase the conductivity. Yet further it is suggested that the resin may include particles of thermoplastic materials that are insoluble in the thermosetting resin such as polyamides in order to improve the impact resistance of the composite comprising the cured prepreg. These references also   include a thermoplastic resin thai is soluble in the thermosetting resin to improve the flow of the resin during processing. Examples of soluble mennoplastic resins that may be used include polyethersnlphones and polyamideimid.es. It has been suggested that conductive particles may be included in an interleaf resin layer as is described in Russian Patent 22635SI which uses hard lerite carbon particles in the interleaf layer to provide lightning protection of exposed aircraft parts. WO 2008/056123 and WO2011/027160 also provide conductive particles in the interleaf layers to improve the ""Z"" direction conductivity. WO2008/05 123 employs metallic particles and WO2011/027160 employs hard glassy carbon particles at a level of from 0.3 to 2.0 vvt % based on the total resin in the prepreg.      United States Patent 7931958 B2 employs both conductive particles and thermoplastic resin particles in an interleaf layer in a prepreg based composite. The conductive particles are used to increase the ""Z"" direction conductivity and the thermoplastic resin particles perform the well known function of toughening the cured composite. These known conductive particles are costly and highly specialised materials. They ma be particles or fibres having a thermoplastic nucleus coated with a conductive substance or a conductive particle such as a carbon particle such as Bellpearl C-600, C-800, C-2000 deiived from phenolic resins or Nicabeads ICS. PC and MC (produced by Nippon Carbon Co Ltd) which are hard carbon particles produced by carbonising and adding a resin surface coating . Also commonly metal or metal-coated conductive particles have been used for this purpose. However, introducing metal into prepregs has been found to be undesirable due to the possibility of corrosion effects, explosion hazards and differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion of the materials.      According to United States Patent 7931958 B2 the total amount of the thermoplastic material and the conductive particles should be 20 wt % or less with respect to the prepreg and the ratio of the weight of mennoplastic particle to the conductive particle is from 1 to 1000. The particles are preferably of a size at most 150  preferably from 5 to 30 . Where the Examples use carbon particles 0.4 parts of Bellpearl C-2000 are used together   with 1 .6 parts of an epoxy modified nylon particle in 100 parts of the thermosetting epoxy resin system, a ratio of 49.0 to provide a <'>""Z"" direction volume resistivity of 28 x 10<3>  cm.      An alternative method for increasing tiie conductivity of composites based on cared prepregs in the <**>Z"" direction is described in PCT publications WO201.0/150022 and WO2011/114140 in. which <'>the surface of the carbon fibres is disrupted during the prepreg manufacturing process. For example, prior to impregnation with the resin, the fibre tow may be passed over rollers with an abrasive surface. This forms protuberances or broken fibrils at the surface of the fibre tows which will extend into the interleaf iterlayer when the resin is applied to the fibres and may contact protuberances formed on the next fibrous layer. This provides to provide an electrically conductive pathway across the interlayer and hence improves electrical conductivity<7> in the ""Z"" direction.      There remains a need to further increase the electrical conductivity in the ""Z"" direction of composites derived from prepregs whilst retaining or enhancing the mechanical properties of the composite. According to the invention, there is provided a prepreg, a moulding material, a composite, a use and a resin composition useful in the production of the prepregs as defined in any of the accompanying claims. We have found that potato shaped graphite (PSG) is particularly useful for increasing the electiical conductivity of fibre reinforced composite, particularly carbon fibre reinforced composite.      The term ""potato graphite"" will be used herein to describe graphite processed to increase the porosity or spherocity of the graphite. The process may be practiced on natural (e.g.. vein graphite) or artificial graphite (e.g., highly crystalline synthetic graphite). Prior to processing, the graphite is commonly scaly (e.g., plate like) or flake graphite having a relatively high degree of crystaUinity. The graphite is processed by nulling, rolling, grinding, compressing, defonmng, etc. the graphite to bend, fold, shape, form, etc. the flakes into a roughly spherical shape. This process may increase the isotropic properties of the graphite over the more anisotropic flake form of the graphite. The potato shaped graphite particles may be coated or uncoated. They may be coated by vapour deposition   which typically deposits a highly conductive layer of carbon. The PSG particle can exhibit a planar crystalline structure, whereas the CVD carbon layer is deposited on top of this as an amorphous carbon coating. The Carbon coating can lower the specific resistivity of the PSG. The PSG particles may also be coated by other coating processes known to the art, for example metallisation or sputtering. They may be coated by carbon in any of its forms, or with metals or polymers. The term potato shaped graphite' is common to the art as can be seen in the following examples: High-Purity Graphite      Powders for High Performance, by Giovanni Juri, Henri-Albert Wilhelm and Jean      L'Heureux, Timed Ltd. Switzerland, 2007 and Graphite: High-tech Supply Sharpens Up, Penny Crossley, industrial Minerals, 2000.      The term ""potato shaped graphite"" is also used herein to describe graphite having a shape that is typically produced by the process described above (whether produced by such process, by another process or processes, naturally occurring, etc.). ""Potato shaped graphite"" commonly ranges in shape from the shape of a potato to almost spherical . ""Potato shaped graphite"" is typically elongated, oblong, etc. and may include graphite having an ellipsoid shape, an ovoid shape, a rectangular shape, an oblate spheroid shape, etc. Both ""potato graphite"" overall and individual particles of ""potato graphite"" do not necessarily have a uniform shape and do not necessarily have a symmetrical shape. As used herein, the term ""potato shaped graphite"" is intended to encompass graphite produced by the process described above, and graphite having the shapes as explained in this paragraph.      Typically PSG have at least one of the following two characteristics: a tap density between 0.3 and 1.5, preferably between 0.5 and 1.4, most preferably between 1 and 1.3 g/ec, when measured according to the method associated with the instrument sold under the name of Logan Instrument Corp. Model Tap-2. They also have a granulometric dispersion measured according to the method associated with the particle analyser sold under the name Microtac Model I 00 Particle Analyzer, such that the D90/D10 distribution ratio varies between 2 and 5, and the particles have a size between 1 urn and 50 , preferably such that the D90 D10 distribution ratio varies between 2.2 and 4.2 and the particles have a size between 2 um and 30  and or combinations of the aforesaid ranges.   We have found that coated PSG particles as supplied Nippon Power Graphite Company of Japan, haying an average particle size of 10 to 20 microns, preferably of 15 microns are particularly suitable for increasing the electrical conductivity of the prepreg. Coated PSG typically has a harde surface <'>than uacoated PSG and a. lower specific resistivity, the resistivity can be at least 50% lower than the uiicoated PSG. In addition PSG particles from KGS Naturgraphii of Germany are suitable for use in this invention. Other suppliers of spheroidal or near spherical graphite with the properties similar to those described above are also suitable for use in this invention. The present invention therefore provides a prepreg comprising a fibre reinforced curable resin the prepreg containing potato shaped graphite.      In a further embodiment the invention provides a composite comprising a fibre reinforced resin the composite containing potato shaped graphite. in a further embodiment the invention provides a resin composition useful in the production of such a prepreg or composite comprising a curable resin containing potato shaped graphite. The invention is particularly useful in compositions comprising resin impregnated fibrous layers separated by an interlayer. Accordingly, the invention therefore provides a composite material comprising at least two layers of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin and an interleaf resin layer there between, said interleaf resin layer or interlayer comprising an electrically conductive particle. The electrically conductive particle may comprise potato shaped giapliite. Preferably the composite material contains from 0.5 to 10 weight % preferably from 1 to 8 weight %, more preferably 0.5 to 5 weight %, especially 1.5 to 5 weight % and most preferably from 2 to 4 weight % in relation to the resin of said electrically conductive particle. Conventionally, in a composite material a resin matrix reinforces the fibrous material by virtue of its presence around the fibrous material or fibrous reinforcement, in the context of this invention, as a result of the structure of the composite material independent layers   of resin in which the fibrous reinforcement is present can be distinguished as fibre reinforced resin layer's, and these layers by virtue of their laminate structure form an mterlayer or interleave there between. In another embodiment of the invention, the pr esence of the electrically conductive particle is optional. In this embodiment,- t least one layer of the carbon fibre reinforcement has a weight in the range of from 10 to 200 g/m<2>, preferably of from 15 to 150 g/m<2>. Advantageously, the carbon fibre reinforcement may be in the form of a spread fabric or flat fibre tow fabric such as the fabric as disclosed in WO 98/46817, the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.      In a preferred embodiment the resin or resin composition and/or the interlayer additionally contain a toughener which is typically a thermoplastic material. The thermoplastic material may be in the form of a particle. The thermoplastic particle may be present in the range of from 5 to 20 weight % in relation to the resin, preferably from 9 to 15 weight % in relation to the resin, arid more preferably from 9 to 14 weight % in relation to the resin. In a yet further preferred embodiment the thermoplastic material is a polyamide. Suitable examples of thermoplastic particles include, by way of example, poly amides, polycarbonates, polyacetal, polyphenylene oxide, poiyphenylene sulphide, polya.cryla.tes, poly ethers, polyesters, polyimides. polyamidoimides, polyether imides, polyurethanes. Polyamides are the preferred type of thermoplastic particles. The polyamide particles may be made from polyamide 6 (caprolactam - PA6). polyamide 12 (laurolactam - PA12), polyamide 11 , polvurethane, polymeihyl metha.cryla.te, crosslinked polymethyl methaciylate, densified polyethylene sulfone. or any combination thereof. Preferred thermoplastic particles are polyamide particles that have a melting point of between about 140C and 240C. The particles should have particle sizes of below 100 microns, it is preferred that the particles range in size from 5 to 60 microns and more preferably from 10 to 30 microns. It is preferred that the average particle size be around 20 microns. Suitable polyamide particles that may be used are: Orgasol 1002 D NAT! (PA6), Rilsan PA11 P C20HT (PA11), Ultramid 4350 (PA6T).   Hie resin or resin formulations used in the present invention preferably comprise curable epoxy resins, curing agents and curing agent accelerators. Cure accelerators may be usually .heat activated and are usually included in the resin to shorten the cure cycle time. Typically the fommlatioiis are cured by heating to a certain temperature for a certain time. The .formulations are developed to possess the desired cure temperature and cure time for the intended application. The reactivity of the formulation is measured as the time required to accomplish a certain degree of cure when held at a certain temperature. The resin system may also contain a thermoplastic material which is soluble in the epoxy resin such as polyethersu!fone to improve the toughness of the resin. in the production of finished articles including composites the prepregs may be cured and laminated together such as in a stack or they may be laminated to other materials. Typically curing takes place by heating the prepregs in a mould, an autoclave, a press or in a vacuum bag to cure the epoxy resin. The cure cycles employed for curing prepregs and stacks of prepregs are a balance of temperature and time, taking into account the reactivity of the resin and the amount of resin and fibre employed. From an economic point of view, in many applications it is desirable that the cycle time is as short as possible, curing agents and accelerators are usually selected to achieve this. As well as requiring heat to initiate curing of the resin, the curing reaction itself can be highly exothermic. This needs to be taken into account in the time/temperahire curing cycle in particular for the curing of large and thick stacks of prepregs, as is increasingly the case with the production of laminates for industrial application where high temperatures can be generated within the stack due to the exoiherm of the resin curing reaction. Excessive temperatures are to be avoided as they can damage the mould or cause some decomposition of the resin. Excessive temperatures can also cause loss of control over the cure of the resin leading to run away ern e. in addition to these problems, there is a desire to produce laminar structures from prepregs in which the cured resin has a high glass transition temperature (Tg), to extend the usefulness of the structures by improving their resistance to exposure at high temperatures, and/or high hiuiiidity for extended periods of time which can cause an undesirable lowering   of the Tg. Preferably, the Tg is from 150C to 200 C, more preferably from I60C to 200     C.      Potato shaped graphite (PSG) particles are described in United States Patent Publication 2010/0092808, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, and have at least one of the following characteristics: a tab density between 0.3 and 1.5 g cc, a potato like shape, and a graniilometric dispersion such that the D90 D10 ratio varies between 2 and 5. and the particles have a size between 1 and 50  as measured using a Microtac Model XI 00 particle analyser. In an embodiment in which disrupted fibres are also in the resin interlayer, the size and shape of the carbon particles is less important as both the fibres and the particles contribute to the increase in conductivity.      Additionally; we have found that by use of the disrupted fibres, smaller amounts of conductive particles are required to achieve a given electr ical conductivity. Potato shaped graphite is a relatively soft material which allows the material to partly disintegrate during resin impregnation and additionally, due to their shape and softness the use of potato shaped graphite particles reduces the tendency of the resin composition to damage the surface of the rollers that are employed in the manufacturing of prepregs. PSG particles that are in a spherical or near spherical shape are preferred as this enables the conductivity to be increased for a minimal concentration of PSG in relation to the resin. It is preferred that the prepreg contain from 0.05 to 4.5 wt % potato shaped graphite, more preferably to 0.1 to 3.0 wt %, and most preferably between 0.25 wt % and 1.5 wt %      One suitable potato shaped graphite (PSG) is the product supplied by NGS Naturgraphit of Germany, called SG25/99.95 SC which has an average particle size of from 10 to 30 microns. Alternatively, PSG supplied by Nippon Power Graphite Company of Japan, called GHDR-15-4 and having an average particle size of from 10 to 30 microns may preferably be used. The GHDR-15-4 comprises a carbon coating deposited by carbon vapour deposition on to its outer surface. Spherical or spheroidal graphite available from other suppliers such as Timrex are also suitable.   In one embodiment the composite of the invention may be formed by curing <'>two or more separate layer's of fibrous reinforcement, impregnated with resin with an interleaf layer of resin containing the potato shaped graphite particles therebetween. The layers preferably comprise omdirectional tows, die tows of each layer being substantially parallel. Tlie two layers may be conjoined by compression so that the unidirectional tows are in the same plane. One or more additional <'>fibrous layers may also be combined with the conjoined layers.      The prepregs of the present invention may be prepared by the process described and illustrated in WO2010/150022, the contents of which, is hereby incorporated by reference. This process comprises feeding a layer of unidirectional conductive fibres having a defined width, bringing into contact with a first face of the fibres a first layer of resin comprising thermosetting resin containing potato shaped graphite and compressing the resin and fibres together by passing over one or more impregnation rollers. The pressure exerted onto the conductive fibres and resin preferably does not exceed 40 kg per centimetre of tlie width of tlie conductive fibres. The resin is preferably provided i sufficient amount for the resin to enter tlie interstices of the fibres and leave a first outer layer of resin essentially free of unidirectioiial conductive fibres. This outer layer becomes tire interlayer. In particular continuously feeding tows of unidirectional conductive fibres, bringing into contact with a face of the fibres a first layer of resin comprising thermosetting resin, and compressing the resin and fibres together through at least one S-wrap stage whilst providing sufficient resin to both enter the interstices of the fibres and leaving a first outer layer of resin.      Prepregs produced by this process can be manipulated to have a disrupted fibre layer, such that when a plurality of such prepregs are stacked together, producing a prepreg stack comprising a plurality of structural layers separated by resin-containing disrupted conductive fibres interleaf layers and containing electrically conductive particles. The prepreg stack is then cm ed to form a cured composite lammate, much greater conductivity in the ""Z"" direction is obtained whilst retaining excellent toughness properties.      Alternatively the interleaf prepregs may be produced in a two stage process. The first stage disrupts the surface of the fibre to produce disrupted fibres and brings the fibre into contact   with resin which enters the interstices, followed by bringing into contact with another resin comprising conductive particles and optionally toiighener particles. This second stage is intended merely to lay down the resin including the particulate materials and in so doing produce a uniform thickness layer of resin free of conductive fibres which becomes an interleaf layer when a plurality of such prepregs are stacked together.      The preferred process to manufacture prepregs of this invention is therefore a continuous process involving the passage of many thousands of fibres through a series of stages, typically guided by rollers. The point where the fibres meet the resin or resin composition of the invention, usually in sheet form, is the start of the impregnation stage. Before the fibres are contacted with the resin and reach the impregnation zone they are typically arranged in a plurality of tows, each tow comprising many thousands of filaments, e.g. 12,000. These tows are mounted on bobbins and are fed initially to a combing unit to ensure even separation of t e fibres. It has been found that unusually low fibre tensions just after the bobbin feed position provide further improvement to the disruption of the fibres in the eventual prepreg. Thus, the tension per filament at this position is preferably from 0.0007 to 0.025 g, preferably from 0.01 to 0.015 g. if disruptive or disrupted fibres are required the fibres may also be passed over roughened surfaces such as abrasive rollers to produce the disruptive or disrupted fibres which become part of the interleaf layer. The fibre processing speed and tension may be controlled to give the desired degr ee of disruption. in the process, a second layer of resin comprising thermosetting resin may be brought into contact with the other face of the fibres typically at the same time as the first layer, compressing the first and second layers of resin such that resin enters the interstices of the fibres. Such a process is considered to be a one-stage process because, although each face of the fibres is contacted with one resin layer, all the resin in the eventual prepreg is impregnated in one stage.   Resin impregnation typically involves passing the resin and fibres over rollers, which, may be arranged .in a variety of ways. Two primary arrangements are the simple ""nip"" arrangement and the ""S-wrap"" arrangement. An S-wrap stage is where the resin and fibres, both in sheet form, pass around two separated rotating rollers in the shape of the letter ""S""s known as S-wrap rollers. Alternative rolle arrangements include the widely used ""nip"", wherein the fibre and resin are pinched, or nipped, together as they pass between the pinch point between two adjacent or opposing rotating rollers. The pressures induced in the resin and fibres can be controlled to cause the desired degree of disruption of the fibre. Parameters such as separation between rollers, speed, relative speed between rollers and resin and fibres and the contact area of the rollers can be vari ed to achieve the desired degree of (fibre) disruption and also resin impregnation.      It is understood that S-wrap provides ideal conditions for reliable and reproducible impregnation of the resin between the interstices of the fibres whilst also providing sufficient disruption.      However, nip stages are also possible, provided the pressures are kept low, e.g. by control over the gap between adjacent rollers.      Multiple sets of S-wra or nip rollers can be used, with each set gradually increasing the pressure applied to the resin. A typical process may also combine sets of S-wrap and Ni rollers in the same production line.      The pressure exerted onto the conductive fibres and resin preferably does not exceed 35 kg per centimetre of width of the conductive fibre layer, more preferably does not exceed 30 kg per centimetre. Rollers from 200 to 400 mm in diameter, more preferably from 220 to 350 mm, most preferably from 240 to 300 mm, have been found to provide the right conditions for achieving the desired disrupted fibre structures.   For example, when in S-wrap arraiigement, two rollers are preferably spaced apart to provide a gap between the centres of them of from 250 to 600 mm, preferably from 280 to 360 mm, most preferably from 300 to 340 mm, e.g. 320 mm.      Two adjacent pairs of S-wrap rollers are preferably separated between the centres of respective rollers of from 200 to 1200 mm, preferably from 300 to 900 mm, most, preferably from 700 to 900 mm e.g. S00 mm. The impregnation rollers may rotate in a variety of ways. They may be freely rotating or driven. If driven, they are conventionally driven so that there is no difference between the speed of rotation and the speed of passage of the resin and fibres over the rollers. Sometimes it may be desirable to apply an increase or decrease of speed of up to 40%, preferably up to 30%, preferably still up to 20%, preferably still up to 30% or most preferably of up to 5% relative to the passage of resin and fibres to promote impregnation or fibre conductivity. Such a difference is referred to in the art as ""trim"".      Following impregnation of resin into the fibres, often there is a cooling stage and further treatment stages such as laminating, slitting and separating.      In a further embodiment, the invention provides a stack of such moulding materials or structures.      The prepregs of the invention may be characterized by its resin content and/or its fibre volume and resia volume and/or its. degree of impregnation as measured by the water up take test.      Resin and fibre content of uncured prepregs or composites are determined in accordance with ISO 11667 (method A) for moulding materials or structures which contain fibrous material which does not comprise unidirectional carbon. Resin and fibre content of uncured prepregs or composite which contain unidirectional carbon fibrous material are determined   in accordance with DIN EN 2559 A. (code A). Resin and fibre content of cured composites which contain carbon fibrous material are detemiined in accordance with DIN EN 2564 A.      The fibre and resin volume % of a prepreg or composite can be determined from the weight % of fibre and resin by dividing the weight % by the respective density of the resin and carbon fibre.      The % of impregnation of a tow or fibrous material which is impregnated with resin is measured by means of a water pick up test.      The water pick up test is conducted as follows. Six strips of prepreg are cut to a size of 100 (+/-2) mm x 100 (+ -2) mm. Any backing sheet material is removed. The samples are weighed near the nearest 0.001 g (Wl). The ships are located between PTFE backed aimmniiuii plates so that 1 mm of the prepreg ship protrudes from the assembly of PTFE backed plates on one end and whereby the fibre orientation of the prepreg is extends along the protruding part. A clamp is placed on the opposite end, and 5 mm of the protruding part is immersed in water having a temperature of 23 C, relative air humidity of 50% +/- 35%, and at an ambient temperature of 23 X. After 5 minutes of immersion the sample is removed fi om the water and any exterior water is removed with blotting paper. The sample is then weighed again W2. The percentage of wate uptake WPU (%) is then calculated by averaging the measured weights for the six samples as follows: WPU (%)=[(<W2>- <W1 )/<Wl>)x 100. The WPU {%) is indicative of the Degree of Resin Impregnation (DRI). Typically, the values for the resin content by weight, for the uncured prepreg of the invention are in the ranges of from 15 to 70% by weight of the prepreg, from 18 to 68% by weight of the prepreg, from 20 to 65% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 60% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 55% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 50% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 45% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 40% by weight of the prepreg. from 25 to 35% by weight of the prepreg, from 25 to 30% by weight of the prepreg, from 30 to 55% by weight of the prepreg, from 32 to 35% by weight of the prepreg. from 35 to 50% by weight, of the prepreg and/or combinations of the aforesaid ranges.   Typically, the values for the resin content by volume for the uncured prepreg of the invention are in the ranges of from 15 to 70% by volume of the prepreg, from 18 to 68% by volume of the prepreg, from 20 to 65% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 60% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 55% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 50% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 45% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 40% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 35% by volume of the prepreg, from 25 to 30% by volume of the prepreg, from 30 to 55% by volume of the prepreg, from 35 to 50% by volume of the prepreg and/or combinations of the aforesaid ranges.      Water pick up values for the uncured prepreg moulding material and tows of the invention may be in the range of from 1 to 90%, 5 to 85%, 10 to 80%, 15 to 75%, 1 to 70%, 15 to 60%, 15 to 50%, 15 to 40%, 15 to 35%, 1 to 30%, 20 to 30%, 25 to 30% and/or combinations of the aforesaid ranges. In a further embodiment the invention provides a process wherein a layer of imidireetional fibrous tows which are fully impregnated with liquid resin are superimposed on a layer of dry unimpregnated unidirectional fibrous tows and the structure consolidated so that the resin penetrates the spaces between the unimpregnated tows but leaves the spaces between the filaments within the tows at least partially unimpregnated. A supporting web or scrim may be provided on one or both sides of the structure preferably before consolidation.      In a preferred embodiment the interior of the tows is at least partially resin free to provide an air venting path or structure, so that air that may be present in the tows from the outset or that may be introduced during impregnation with the liquid resin is not trapped within the structure by the resin and can escape during preparation and consolidation of the prepreg. The air is able to escape along the length of the tows and also from the second side of the fibrous layer if the impregnation by the resin is such that some or all of the surface of the second side of the fibrous layer is not carrying resin. Furthermore, the provision of the spaces between the filaments of the tows will allow air trapped between the prepregs during stack formation to escape particularly if, in addition, one side of the prepreg is not entir ely coated with resin.   Hie prepregs of this invention may be produced from normally available epoxy resins which may contain a hardener or curing agent and optionally an accelerator. In a preferred embodiment the epoxy .resin is free of a traditional hardener such as dicyandiamide and in particular we have found. <'>that desirable prepregs can be obtained by use of hardener -such as anhydrides, particularly polycarboxylic anhydrides; amines, particularly aromatic amines e.g. l,3-diariiiiiobenzene, <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000017_0001"" />and particularly the sulphones and methylene bisanilines, e.g. 4>4'-diaminodiphenyl sulphone (4,4' DDS), and 3,3 '-diarninodiphenyl sulphone (3,3' DDS), 4.4'-methylenebis (2-ineihyl-6- isopi pyla iline) (M-MIPA), 4.4'-methylenebis (3-chloro-2t6-diethylene aniline) ( - CDEA), 4, '-methylenebis (2,6 diemyleneaiiilhie) (M-DEA) and the phenol- formaldehyde resins, and/or combinations of the aforesaid curing agents. Preferred curing agents are the methylene bisanilines and the amino sulphones, particularly 4,4' DDS and 3,3' DDS. The relative amount of the curing agent and the epoxy resin that should be used will depend upon the reactivity of the resin, the desired shelf life, desired processing properties and the nature and quantity of the fibrous reinforcement in the prepreg.      In order to produce composites with substantially uniform mechanical properties it is important that the structural fibres and the epoxy resin be mixed to provide a substantially homogenous prepreg. The preferred prepreg of this invention contain a low level of voids between the tows. It is therefore preferred that eacli prepreg and the prepreg stack has a water pick-up value of less than 6% or less than 2%, more preferably less than 1 %, most preferably less than 0.5%. The water pick-up test determines the degree of wateiproofing or impregnation between the miidireetional tows of the prepregs of this invention. In this test, a specimen of prepreg material is initially weighed and clamped between two plates in such a way thai a strip 5 mm wide protrudes. This arrangement is suspended in the direction of the fibres in a water bath at room temperature (2IC) for 5 minutes. The specimen is then removed from the plates and weighed again and the difference in weight provides a value for the degree of impregnation within the specimen. The smaller the amomit of wa ter picked up, the higher the degree of waterproofing or impregnation.      The prepregs of this invention are intended to be laid-up with other composite materials (e.g. other prepregs which may also be according to this invention or they may be other      18   prepregs) to produce a curable laminate or a prepreg stack. The prepreg is typically produced as a roll of prepreg and in view of the tacky nature of such materials, a backing sheet is generally provided to enable the roll to be unfurled at the point of use. Thus, preferably the prepreg according to the invention may comprise a backing sheet on an external face to facilitate handling of the material and or rolling up of the material. The backing sheet ma comprise a polyolefin based material such as polyethylene, polypropylene and/or copolymers thereof. The backing sheet may comprise embossing. Tins has the advantage of providing the prepreg with an air venting surface structure. The air venting surface structure comprising embossed channels which allow air to escape during processing. This is particularly useful as this prevents inter-ply entrapment as inter- ply air is effectively removed via the air venting surface channels.      A preferred use of the prepregs of the present invention is as a tape; the prepregs can be prepared as a roll of ma terial prepared specifically for an automatic tape lay-up device. The prepregs are provided with backing sheets which are removed when they are laid up in the mould. Thus, the prepreg typically provided with a backing sheet is preferably sufficiently flexible so as to be able to form a roll with a diameter of less than 20 cm, preferably less than 10 cm. Known automatic lay-up apparatus requires the roll to satisfy-' particular dimensions. For example, the roll is either wound onto a 254 mm or 295 mm inside diameter core within a tolerance of 0.5 mm. As such, the composite material is preferably not so thick that it cannot easily be rolled. Thus typically the composite material has a thickness of from 0.5 to 5.0 mm. preferably from 0.5 to 4.0, most preferably from 1.0 to 3.0 mm. The roll can be cut to standard prepreg tape sizes which include 600 mm (24'<*>), 300 mm (12"")s 150 mm 75 mm (3""), 50 mm (2""), 25 mm (1""), 6.34 mm (1/4 "") and 3. IS mm (1/8"") in width, and cut within a tolerance of 0.050 mm and then laid-up as several layers of tape and cured. Tapes are frequently used in this way in the production of aircraft components.      The prepregs of this invention are produced by impregnating the fibrous material with the epoxy resin composition of the invention as previously described. The viscosity of the resin composition and the conditions employed for impregnation are selected to enable the desired degree of impregnation . It is preferred that during impregnation the resin containing   the conductive particles and optionally the thermoplastic toughening particles has a viscosity of from 0.1 Pa.s to 100 Pa.s, preferably from 6 to 100 Pa.s, more preferably from 18 to SO Pa.s and even more preferably from 20 to 50 Pa.s. In order to increase the rate of impregnation, the process may be carried out at an elevated temperature so that the viscosity of the resin is reduced. However it must not be so hoi for a sufficient length of time that premature curing of the resin occurs. Thus, the inipregnation process is preferably earned out at temperatures in the range of from 40C to 110C more preferably 60C to 80C. it is preferred that the resin content of the prepregs is such that after curing the structure contains from 30 to 40 wt %, preferably 31 to 37 wt % more preferably 32 to 35 wt % of the resin. The relative amount of resin and multifilament tow, the impregnation line speed the viscosity of the resin and the density of the multifilament tows should he correlated to achieve the desired degree of impregnation between the tows and to provide the interleaf layer of resin that is essentially free of the fibres providing the reinforcement. The epoxy resin used in resin composition of the invention and/or in the preparation of the prepreg preferably has an Epoxy Equivalent Weight (EEW) in the range from 10 to 1500, preferably it has an EEW in the range of from 50 to 500. Preferably the resin composition comprises the epoxy resin and an accelerator or curing agent. Suitable epoxy resins may comprise blends of two or more epoxy resins selected from nionofcneiional, difunctional, trifunctional and/or tetrafunctional epoxy resins.      Suitable difunctional epoxy resins, by way of example, include those based on: diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F (bisphenol F epoxy resin), diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (bisphenol A epoxy resin) (optionally broniinated), phenol and cresol epoxy novolacs. glycidyl ethers of phenol-aldehyde adducts, glycidyl ethers of aliphatic diols, diglycidyl ether, diethyiene glycol diglycidyl ether, aromatic epoxy resins, aliphatic polyglycidyl ethers, epoxidised olefins, broniinated resins, aromatic glycidyl amines, heterocyclic glycidyl irmdines and amides, glycidyl ethers, fruorinated epoxy resins, glycidyl esters or any combination thereof.      Difunctional epoxy resins may be selected from diglycidyl ether of bisphenol F, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A. diglycidyl dihydroxy naphthalene, or any combination thereof.   Suitable trifunctional epoxy resins, by way of example, may include those based upon phenol and cresol epoxy novolacs, glyeidyl ethers of phenol-aldehyde adducts, aromatic epoxy resins, aliphatic triglycidyl ethers, dialipliatic triglycidyl ethers, aliphatic polyglycidyi amines, heterocyclic glycidyi imidines and amides, glyeidyl ethers, iloorinated epoxy resins, or any combination thereof.

The aforesaid hardeners may be present in relation to the resin system, such that the resin contains hardener in the range of from 10 to 25 weight % in relation to the resin, preferably from 10 to 20 weight %, and more preferably from 15 to 20 weight % in relation to the resin.      In a preferred embodiment, the resin may comprise a combination of one or more of the following components: a base resin component in the form of a tri-g!ycidyl aminophenoi in the range of from 8 to 34% by weight, of the resin, a further base resin component in the form of a bis-phenol epoxy in the range of from 20 to 28% by weight of the resin, a further base resin component in the form of a tetra-glycidyl amine in the range of from 25 to 35% by weight of the resin, a toughener in the form of a polyethersulphone in the range of from 10 to 25% by weight of the resin, a curative in the form of methyl anhydride (NMA) or   cu.nmodiphenylsmfone in the range of from 2 to 28% by weight of the resin. The resin may further comprise a polyaniide as herein described in the range of from 10 to 15% by weight of the resin. A preferred exemplary resin is composed of: 25 to 35 wt% tetrafimctional epoxy resin; .18 to 28 wt% difunciional epoxy resin; 4 to 18 wt% polyethersiufone (PES) 2 to 10 wt.% polvamide 12 (PA 12) particles; 2 to 10 wt% polyamide 11 (PAl l) particles; 1 to 8 wt% potato-shaped graphite (PSG) particles; and 17.4 to 27.4 wt% curing agent.

Polyamide particle sizes of irom 5-30 microns are preferred for these formulation. Polyamide particle sizes of from 10-20 microns are even more preferred.      Where disruptive or disrupted fibres are employed in this invention they may be derived from the reinforcing fibres and particularly carbon filament tows and they provide conductive filaments located at the surface of the carbon fibre layer. These filaments extend into the resin interlayer so that when cured under elevated temperature, a cured composite material is produced comprising a aired structural layer of packed conductive- fibres and an interlayer of cured resin, the interlayer of cured resin, comprising the disruptive fibres dispersed therein together with the electiOconductive particles.   The disruptive fibres are believed to form electrical contacts between, themselves and also with the conductive particles and thus providing electrical conductivity across the interiayer so increasing the electrical conductivity in the ""Z"" direction of the cured composite material. If two such pfepregs. are laid together, the first oute layer of resin of one prepreg, and if present an oute layer of resin of the other prepreg, form a resin interleaf layer between two layers of electrically conductive fibres.      The conductive disrupted filaments may be prepared by manipulation of an outer face of the structural layer of conductive fibres to generate fibres by disrupting a proportion of the reinforcing fibres.      Tims, in a second aspect, the invention relates to a process for producing a prepreg, the process comprising passing a sheet of electrically conductive fibres to a fibre disrupting means. This causes a proportion of the fibres or fibrils on an external face of the sheet to become disrupted filaments. The fibres are subsequently impregnated with the thermosetting resin of this invention, thus generating an outer layer of resin in contact with the external face of the sheet comprising the structural fibres which also comprises the disrupted filaments, and wherein the tliemiosetting resin additionally contains electrically conductive particles.      The electrically conductive particles preferably have a size whereby at least 50% of the particles present in the resin have a size within 20  or 10  or 5  of the thickness of the resin interleaf layer. In other words the difference between the thickness of the resin interleaf layer and the size of the electrically conductive particles is less than 10 . Preferably the electrically conductive particles have a size whereby at least 50% of the particles present in the resin have a size within 5 um of the thickness of the resin layer. The resin interleaf layer can be measured by microscopy analysis and is well known in the art. The size of at least 50% of the electrically conductive paiticies is therefore such thai they bridge across the interleaf thickness and the particles are in contac t with an upper fibrous reinforcement ply and a lower fibrous reinforcement ply arranged about the resin layer.   The disrupting means manipulates the fibres at an external face to become filaments which may be free filaments or may remain attached to the base carbon fibre. The term ""free <>filaments"" means -filaments which are not physically or chemically bound to any oilier body and are essentially mobile. Free filaments thus formed are not adhered to any other fibres and are freely mobile.      For example, tire free fibres typically have a distribution of lengths with a mean length of less than 2.0 cm, preferably less than 1.0 cm, more preferably less than 0.5 cm.      The disruption means may generate the disrupted filaments in a number of ways depending on how the structural fibres are arranged, for example by breaking points of adhesion between structural fibres and breaking structural fibres into shorter lengths, or by forming loop, or individual breaks which permit free ends of filaments to migrate into the interlayer.      Thus, the invention can involve actively generati g fuzz or broken fibres. As is described in WO2011/1141 0, which is hereby incorporated by reference, the conductive fibres are unidirectional fibres and the disruption means involves passing the fibres over an abrasion surface, thereby causing breakage of a proportion of the fibres on the external face passing in contact with the abrasion surface, whilst the fibres not in contact with the abrasion surface remain unbroken. it has been found that breaking from 0.5 to 5.0 t. % of the fibres in at least one location provides good results.      As discussed above, unidirectional fibre sheets are typically formed from a plurality of tows of fibres, which are spread out to merge together, prior to impregnation with resin. A common method of achieving this is to pass the fibres over a plurality of sequential spreader bars or rollers.   It is therefore convenient for the abrasion surface to be incorporated in an existing spreader bar arrangement. Thus, in a preferred, embodiment, the abrasion surface is the surface of a spreader bar. Furthermore, it. has been found that if the abrasion surface spreader ba is positioned late in di sequence of spreader bars, then further improvements in conductivity can be obtained. Thus, preferably the abrasion surface spreader bar is in the last three, preferably in the last two. and most preferably is the last spreader bar in a spreader bar sequence. The abrasion surface may be made from any suitable material, such as metal or ceramic, however tungsten carbide is preferred.      In a. preferred embodiment, the process involves passing the sheet of electric-ally conductive fibres to a second fibre disrupting means to cause a proportion of the fibres on the other external face of the sheet to become free fibres.      Tims, at least two spreader bars may comprise abrasion surfaces, each one in contact with each of the external faces of the sheet of conductive fibres. However, it has been found that the roughness of the abrasive surface is a key parameter and thus preferably the abrasive surface has a Ra roughness of at least 1.5 micrometres, more preferably at least 2.5 micromeires.      Another important factor is the relative speed of movement of the fibres over the surface. Preferably the relative speed of movement is from 2 to 20 m/'min.      Once the sheet of electrically conductive fibres comprising free fibres on one or both external faces is prepared, the next stage is resin impregnation as previously described. The good mechanical properties are generally attributed to the presence of interlayers which are free of structural fibres, and contain toughening materials such as thermoplastic particles that, are insoluble in the resin. However, these traditional interlayers contribute to   the poor ""Z"" direction electrical conductivity because they provide a spacing between adjacent layers of conductive fibres. The present invention overcomes this problem without affecting the good mechanical performance provided by the interiayer by providing the disruptive fibres and providing electrically conductive particles in the resin. Thus the invention is equally applicable if the impregnation process is a one-stage or two-stage process.      In a preferred embodiment where an additional toughening particulate material is included in the resin composition of the invention,, the additional toughening material can be of a wide variety of materials.      Where the additional toiighening material is a polymer it should be insoluble in the matrix resin, typically an epoxy resin at room temperature and at the elevated temperatures at which flie resin is cured. Depending upon the melting point of the thermoplastic polymer. it may melt or soften to varying degrees during curing of the resin at elevated temperatures and re-solidify as the cured laminate is cooled. Suitable thermoplastics should not dissolve in the resin, and include thermoplastics, such as polyamides (PAS), and polyefherimide (PEI). Polyamides such as nylon 6 (PA6) and nylon 12 (PA 12) and nylon 11 (PA11) and/or mixtures thereof are preferred.      The reinforcing fibres may be synthetic or natural fibres or any other form of materia] or combination of materials that, combined with the resin composition of the invention, forms a composite product. The reinforcement web can either be provided via spools of fibre that are unwound or from a roll of textile. Exemplary fibres include glass, carbon, graphite, boron, ceramic and aramid. Preferred fibres are carbon and glass fibres particularly carbon fibres. Hybrid or mixed fibre systems may also be envisaged. The use of cracked (i.e. stretch-broken) or selectively discontinuous fibres may be advantageous to facilitate lay- up of the product according to the invention and improve its capability of being shaped. Although a unidirectional fibre alignment is preferable, other forms may also be used. Typical textile forms include simple textile fabrics, knit fabrics, twill fabrics and satin weaves. It is also possible to envisage using non-woven or non-crimped fibre layers. The surface mass of fibre filaments within the fibrous reinforcement is generally 80 to 4000   g/m<2>, preferably 100 to 2500 g/m<2>, and especially preferably 150 to 2000 g m<2>. The filaments are arranged in Sows. The number of carbon filaments per tow can vary from 3000 to 320,000, again preferably from 6,000 to 160,000 and most preferably from 12,000 to 48,000. For fibreglass reinforcements, fibres of 600 to 2400 tex axe particularly adapted. Carbon fibre is preferred if the prepregs and composites are used in aerospace components..      The tows may be spread to form light weight reinforcement material, typically having a weight in the range of from 10 to 200 g/nr (gsm), preferably of from 15 to 150 g m<2>, more preferably fr om 20 to 100 g m<2> or fiom 30 to 80 g/m<2> and/or combinations of the aforesaid ranges. One or more resin layers may be reinforced by containing this light weight fabric. The light weight reinforcement may comprise carbon reinforcement. Oilier resin layers may contain carbon reinforcement of a heavier area weight as hereinbefore described.      Advantageously, the carbon fibre reinforcement may be in the form of a spread fabric or fiat fibre tow fabric such as the fabric as disclosed in WO 98/46817, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of such spread fabric are 268 gsi , 194 gsm, 134 gsm and 75 gsm as derived from T700 carbon fibre as supplied by Toray. Alternatively, commercial fabrics such as mwltiaxial non-crimp fabrics (NCF) C-Ply 268 gsm (2 x 134 gsm, 0+/- 45), C-Ply 1 0 (2 x 75) 0/20/0/25 derived from the same T700 fibres as supplied by Chomarat; or Textreme 160 ( 2 x 80 gsm plies 0/90), or Textreme 160 ( 2 x 80 gsm plies 0/90) derived from the same T700 fibres as supplied by Oxeon SE.      Spread tow fabrics and tapes can be produced using HS (high strength), IM (intermediate modulus) and HM (high modulus) carbon fibres as well as other types of high performance fibres. Spread tow carbon unidirectional materials may be available in the following fibre types and weights: Intermediate modulus carbon > 21 gsm, high strength carbon > 40 gsm, high modulus carbon > 65 gsm, heavy tow (> 48k filaments) > 100 gsm.      Spread tow carbon fabrics may be available in the following fibre types and weights.

Alternative angles may also be used such as +45/- 45, +3G/-6G, +50/-25, etc.      The interleave or iiiierlayer which may be formed by combining carbon reinforced resin layers whereby the carbon reinforcement is of a light weight, may differ from the interleave of resin layers containing a heavier carbon fibre reinforcement. The interleave may have a thickness in the range of from 10 to 45 , preferably from 1      Particles which may be present in the interleave may have a size in the range of from 15 to 30 , preferably from 15 to 25 . The particles may comprise toughners, electrically conductive particles and/or combinations of the aforesaid particles.      Exemplary layers of unidirectional fibrous tows are made from HexTow carbon fibres, which are available from Hexcel Coiporafion. Suitable HexTow carbon fibres for use in making unidirectional fibre tows include: IM7 carbon fibres, which are available as tows mat contain 6,000 or 12,000 filaments and weigh 0.223 g/m and 0.446 g/m respectively; IM8-IM10 carbon fibres, which are available as tows that contain 12,000 filaments and weigh from 0.446 g m to 0.324 g/m; and AS? carbon fibres, which are available in tows that contain 12,000 filaments and weigh 0.800 g/m, tows containing up to 80,000 or 50,000 (50K) filaments may be used such as those containing about 25,000 filaments available from Toray and those containing about 50,000 filaments available from Zoltek. The tows typically have a width of from 3 to 7 mm and are fed for impregnation on equipment employing combs to hold the tows and keep them parallel and unidirectional.      Once prepared the prepreg may be rolled-up, so that it can be stored for a period of time. it can then be unrolled and cut as desired and optionally laid up with other prepiegs to form a prepreg stack in a mould or in a vacuum bag which is subsequently placed in a mould and cured.      28   Once prepared, the prepreg or prepreg stack may be cured, by exposure to an elevated temperature, and optionally elevated pressure, to produce a cured composite laminate. As discussed above, the prepregs of the present invention can provide excellent mechanical properties without requiring the high pressures encountered in an autoclave process.      Thus, in further aspect, the invention relates to a process of curing the thermosetting resin within a prepreg or prepreg stack as described herein, the process involving exposing the prepreg or prepreg stack to a temperature sufficient to induce curing of the thermosetting resin composition and is preferably carried out at a pressure of less than 10 or 7 or 3.0 bar absolute.      The curing process may be carried out at a pressure of less than 10 or 7 o 3.0 or 2.0 bar absolute, preferably less than 1 bar absolute. In a particularly preferred embodiment the pressure is less than atmospheric pressure. The curing process may be carried out at one or more temperatures in the range of from 150 to 260C, preferably from ISO to 220 C, more preferably from 160 to 210C for a time sufficient to cure the thermosetting resin composition to the desired degr ee. Curing at a pressure close to atmospheric pressure can be achieved by the so-called vacuum bag technique. This involves placing the prepreg or prepre stack in an air-tight bag and creating a vacuum on the inside of the bag. This has the effect that the prepreg stack experiences a consolidation pressure of up to atmospheric pressure, depending on the degree of vacuum applied. The vacuum bag techniques can also be applied within an autoclave.      Once aired, the prepreg or prepreg stack becomes a composite laminate, suitable for use in a structural application, for example an aerospace structure. Such composite laminates c an comprise structural fibres at a level of from 45% to 75% by volume (fibre volume fraction), preferably from 55% to 70% by volume, more preferably from 60% to 68% by volume (DEN EN 2564 A).   The laminates produced from the prepregs of this invention preferably contain less than 1% by volume of voids, or less than 0.7% by volume of voids, typically less than 0.1% by volume and. particularly less than 0.05% by volume based on the total volume of the .laminate as measured by microscopic analysis of 20 spaced cross sections measuring 30 x 40 ram in cross section (spacing 5 cm) of a cured sample of the laminate.      The unique properties of the lightweight layers used in this invention make it possible to cure the laminates using such layers in an out-of-autoelave process. This relatively lo pressure and low cost curing process can be used because- the damage tolerance (e.g. Compression After Impact. - CAT) of the cured laminate is not substantially less than the damage tolerance achieved using the higher pressure and higher expense of an autoclave. In contrast, out-of-autociave curing of laminates that have interleaf zones toughened with insoluble<'> thermoplastic particles produces cured laminates that have<'> damage tolerances that are significantly reduced.      Within this application the electrical conductivity of composite laminates in the ""Z"" direction is measured by the following method. A panel is prepared from multiple unidirectional prepreg layers so that the fibre orientations of subsequent layers in 0/90. The panel is cured by autoclave aire at a temperature of 180C for 2 hours under a pressure of 0.7 MPa to form a cured panel of 300 mm x 300 mm x 3rnm in size. Specimens (four) for test are then cut from the panel so that these are sized as 40 mm x 40 mm x 3 mm. The square faces of the specimens are sanded on a finisher machine to expose the carbon fibres. Excess sanding is prevented as this would penetrate past the first ply into the first mtralaminar layer. The square faces are then coated with a. metal such as gold via thermal sputtering to a thickness of approximately 30 nm or tin-zinc to a thickness of at least. 10 micrometers via arc-spraying. Any metal on the sides of the specimens is removed by sanding prior to testing.      Each side of the specimens is contacted with a copper braid or wire to form electrodes which extend diagonally across the metal plated surfaces. A power source (TTz EL-302P   programmable 30V/2A power supply unit, Thurlby Tliandar Instnmienis, Cambridge, UK) which is capable of varying both voltage and current is used to detemime the resistance. Two or four electrodes can be used per sample, the latter is preferred as it is more reproducible. The power source is contacted with the electrodes and held in place using a clamp. The clamp has a non-conductive coating or layer to prevent an electrical path from one braid to the other. A current of one ampere is applied and the voltage noted. Using Ohm's Law resistance can then be calculated (R= V/T). The test, is carried out on each of the cut specimens to give a range of values. To ensure confidence in the test each specimen is tested two times. To verify the measurement, the resistivity is also measured using a Flux Multimeter by placing one electrode on one plated surface and the other electrode on the opposite plated surface.      From the calculated resistance [Ohm], the conductivity [Siemens] is calculated as Conductivity () = thickness of specimen (t)/resistance (R) x area of specimen (A) The cross ply conductivity is calculated by dividing the conductivity value by the thickness of the laminate (3 mm), so through thickness conductivity =  /thickness.      Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a process which may be used to manufacture prepregs of the present invention.      Figure 2 is a schematic representation of another process which may be used<'> to manufacture prepregs of the present invention.      Ti iing to Figure 1, the process proceeds from right, to left beginning with a creel unit 8 which can support 370 spools of carbon fibre tows, each tow having 12,000 individual carbon filaments. Each fibre bobbin on the creel is tensioned by a strap and spring arrangement to provide a uniform tow to tow fibre tension to the machine. The tows of fibre pas from the creel to a comb. Before they enter the comb a measurement of individual tow tension is taken at location 10 in Figure 1. Individual 12k carbon fibre tow tensions are measured here with a hand held fibre tensiomeier. Fibre break load on the creel from the strap and spring assembly is controlled to provide a fibre tension at this point of around 160 g/tow.   A random selection of ten tows from each of the process webs Is measured for quality control and checking the nominal fibre tow tension is at the preferred individual tow tension of 160 g/tow. The fibre tows then pass through, a comb 12. The fibre comb acts to separate the carbon fibre tows and align them into the fibre spreading bar section and control the overall fibre web width so that prepreg fibre area! weight is within required tolerances. The fibre tows then pass onto a load cell roller 14 which measures the global overall applied tension to the carbon fibres. The fibres then pass through spreader bars 16. These bars control fibre tensioning and spreading to control the final fibre tension and alignment of fibres before they make contact with the resin coated films at the pinch point 22.      The two bars forming pinch point.22 are locked so they do not rotate, other bars before this do rotate. The first spreader bar 16 is a load cell roller to monitor overall global fibre tension incoming to the spreader bar system. The fibre tows are heated in tins spreader bar section by an infrared heater (not shown) in preparation for impregnation by the resin composition of the invention. The infrared heater softens the fibre sizing in order to help promote good fibre impregnation. The fibre sizing is an epoxy solution that is applied to the carbon fibre at. point of manufacture to aid fibre handling but in some instances the sizing can restrict fibre spreading and impregnation.      The two pre-coated resin film rolls are loaded to the prepreg machine unwinds, one above the prepreg web 18 and one below the prepreg web 20. These film rolls provide resin that is fed by top film unwind 18 and bottom film unwind 20. The resin and fibres meet at pinch point 22. No significant impregnation occurs at this point.      Pre-coated resin films are at nominally 69 gsm for this 268 fibre area! weight product so that 34% resin content by weight is achieved in the final product. The resin is coated onto the right side of a super calendared double sided differential value silicone release coated paper. Film roll braking tensions at unwinds 18 and 20 are controlled and matched with the final fibre web tension in order to run a crease free prepreg web through the hot S-wrap impregnation zone 24. 28.   The resin and fibres then pass through the first S-wrap compactor 24 and then through another infrared heating stage 26 for further heating. The prepreg is heated under the TR heater to 120 to 130C so that resin viscosity is reduced before the web enters the 2<nd>., 3<rd> and 4<i34> heated S-wrap roll sets, as shown in Figure 1 , for resin impregnation into the structural fibrous layer of  2k carbon fibre tows. At this stage of the process, after the IR heater 26, the resin has a low enough viscosity for impregnation into the fibres.      The resin and fibres pass through three more S-wrap compactors 28 where the impregnation occurs to produce disrupted fibre layers with reliable and sufficient impregnation. These S-wrap roller sets are heated to 135 to I40C, are 270 mm diameter and are separated to form a gap between them of 350 to 450 mm.      The rotational speed on these rollers are controlled so that web wrapping forces are high in order for these forces to act on the prepreg web for disruption of the structural fibre layer and cause high resin flow into the carbon fibres for good impregnation to be achieved. The disruption of the structural fibre layer by the S-wrap wrapping forces has been found to be required for low resistance values and impregnation is needed for success in the automated prepreg tape laying operation in customer processes. The fibre and resin then passes over a chilled plate 30. The prepreg web is chilled on this chill plate to cool the prepreg to 20 to 22C so that a process paper can be removed prior to further conventional processing prepreg processing stages that follow the chill plate and which are not shown here but are known to the skilled person.      We shall discuss the process of Figure 2 (Process 2) in relation to the below Examples.      Examples      In the following examples prepregs were prepared using two different processes illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 corresponding to Process 1 and Process 2 respectively. Common to both processes the fibre tows are supplied from a creel 100 (or 8 of figure 1) which contains multiple spools holding the fibre tows. Each fibre tow contains multiple carbon fibre filaments (12000 filaments) which each have a diameter of about 5 microns. The tows are spread out by conducting the tows over spreader bars. The spreader bars are cylindrical   bars which have a smooth surface (smface roughness of less than 0.1 microo). Hie tension in the fibres, and the path of the fibre tows over the bars causes the fibre tows to flatten arid tints spread. Spreader bars are widely used to flatten and spread fibre tows.      Followin the spreader bars, the fibres were impregnated on both sides by resin films of this invention 104 (or 18 and 22 of Figure I). The resin films contained thermoplastic particles (PA 6 or PA 11) and the resins of the Examples of the invention also contained co ductive particles. The first stage of impregnation is common to both processes, whereby the fibres and resin were ran over an S shaped compactor (S wr ap) 106 (or 24 of Figure 1) and through an infrared heating chamber 107 (or 26 of figure 1). The heating of the resin encouraged the resin to How into the fibres. The remaining steps of impregnation wa performed by either of the methods depic ted in Figure I or 2. Figure 2, referred to herein as Process 2, passed the resin and fibres through 3 nip rollers (3 N) 1 10, which compacted and further compressed the resi into the fibres. Figure 1 , referred to herein as Process 1, passed the resin and fibres through 3 further S -wraps (28) which compacted and further compressed the resin into the fibres. The impregnated fibres were then chilled by a chill plate 1 12 (or 30 of figure i).      Following this step, backing papers were rewound 114 and the prepreg was backed with polythene backing 116 (not shown on figure 1)      The products of the invention contain conductive particles in combination with the thermoplastic particles. A product is a prepreg containing an uncured thermosetting resin and a carbon fibre of the areal weight 268 g/niA The thermosetting resin contains a blend of Afunctional epoxy resin (from Huntsman), bisphenol-F epoxy, and 4,434DS curative. The resin contains a thermoplastic additive in the form of polyethersulphone (PES), which is dissolved in the thermosetting resin, in addition the product contains thennoplastic paiticles in the form of polyamide such as PA 6 ( nylon 6) or PA 11 (nylon 11) in a concentration of 9.5 to 13.5 weight % based on the resin. The volume average diameter of   the thermoplastic particles is 20 microns as determined by Coulter measurement (laser diffraction analysis).      The Examples compare the ""Z"" direction conductivity and mechanical performance in systems in which the fibres are smooth or disrupted and ""di&i iption"" in the fibre beds on either side of the resin layer, may be inferred from microphotographs. The interlayers are formed when prepregs plies are stacked up together. The conductive fibre elements appear to include broken fibre filaments and/or fibre filaments which have been displaced as a result of the force exerted during impregnation of the fibre tows with resin.      The lay up of the prepregs is a 0/90 configuration.      The resistance and conductivity in the Examples were determined as follows.      Conductivity of composite laminates test method      The conductivity is measured by coating samples with a metal and attaching electrodes to the sample. We have found that the values obtained vary according to the metal used and the thickness of the metal coating and accordingly measurements should be made on samples using the same metal and provided with a metal layer of substantially the same thickness.      A panel is prepared by autoclave cure that is 300 mm x 300 mm x 3 mm in size. The lay- up of the panel is 0/90. Specimens (typically four) for test are then cut from the panel that are 40 mm x 40 nun. The square faces of the specimens should be sanded (for example on a Linisher machine) to expose the carbon fibres. This is not necessary if peel ply is used during the cure. Excess sanding should be avoided as this will penetrate past the first ply. The square faces are then coated with an electrically conductive metal a thin (approximately 3 am) layer of gold via a sputterer (Technique 1) or a 120 micron thick layer of tin-zinc (70:30) applied by arc spraying (Technique 2 ). Any gold or tin zinc on the sides of the specimens should be removed by sanding prior to testing. The metal coating is required to ensure low contact resistance. The tin- zinc arc spraying technique i preferred as we have found that there is lesson significant variability in the results as opposed to   samples which were coated by gold sputtering and tested for conductivity as herein described.      A power source (TTi EL302-P programmable 30V 2A power supply unit, Tburlby Tliandar Instruments, Cambridge, UK) that is capable of varying both voltage and current is used to determine the resistance. The specimen, is contacted with the electrodes (tinned copper braids) of the power source and held in place using a clamp (one must ensure the electrodes do not touch each other or contact other metallic surfaces as this will give a false result). Two or four electrodes per specimen were used, the latter was preferred as it is more reproducible. Ensure the clamp has a non-conductive coating or layer to prevent an electrical path from one braid to the other. A current of one ampere is applied and the voltage noted. Using Ohm's Law resistance can then be calculated (V/l). The test is carried out on each of the cut specimens to give range of values. Each specimen is tested two times. To verify the measurement, the resistivity<7> is also measured using a Flux Multimeter by placing one electrode on one plated surface and the other electrode on the opposite plated surface. From the resistance (R) a conductivity value can be calculated as defined herein before.      Example 1      A prepreg which contains an uncured thermosetting resin composition of the invention and a carbon 7 fibre of the area! weight 268 g/ni<2> was prepared on an experimental pilot prepreg hue. The thermosetting resin contained a blend of trifimctional epoxy resin (from Huntsman), bisphenol-F epoxy, and 44DDS curative. The resin contained a thermoplastic additive in the form ofpoiyethersulphone (PES), which was dissolved in the thermosetting resin. In addition the product contained thermoplastic particles in the form of polyamide PA 6 (nylon 6) in a concentration of 13.5 weight % based on the total weight of the formulated thermosetting resin (which also contains the additive particles). The volume average diameter of the thermoplastic particles was 20 microns as determined by Coulter measurement (laser diffraction analysis). The prepreg was produced in accordance with Process 1 as described hereinbefore. We have observed that the Z-direciion electrical conductivity of this material is in the range of 1-6 S/ni.   Example la      This product is a prepreg which is identical i composition to Example 1. However, the product is produced, by a process that includes two rough spreader bars (RSB) and the step. of doubling up of the fibre tows by additio al smooth fibre spreading bars (NFS). The rough spreader bars have a surface roughness of 4 microns as opposed to the smooth spreader<'> bars which have a roughness of approximately 0.1 micron. Before the fibre is fed into the impregnation line, the fibre tows ran through the spreader bar arrangement which includes the rough spreader bars, in the NFS pattern around the spreader bars forming an undulating surface in the fibre layer. Following fibre spreading, the unidirectional fibre tows are impregnated by two resin films on either side of the fibres as it is fed between nip rollers. The ""Z"" direction electrical conductivity of tins maieriai is in the range of from of 4-15 S/m and the fibres are disrupted as is observed from micrographs of a cured quasi isotropic laminate.      Example lb      Prepreg was produced in the same way as in Examples I, la; however this time conductive particles were also added to the prepregs of Examples 1, la. The resulting product contained iliemiopiasiic particles in the form of polyamide 6 (PA 6) in a concentration of 13.5 wt % based on the thermosetting resin. The resin further contained glassy carbon particles (CMS) having a volume average diameter of 15 or 30 microns as determined by Coulter measurement using a Becknian Coulter. The concentration of the particles varied from 1 wt % to 3 wt %.      Carbon microspheres (CMS) were supplied by HTW Hochiemperaiur-Werkstoffe of Germany and are called Sigradur G (10-20) that have an average particle size of 15 microns and Sigradur G (20-50) that have an average particle size of 30 microns as determined with a Beckman Coulter.      Conductivity achieved was between 5.0-12.1 S/m at a loading range of 0.5-3.0 weight % in relation to the resin. The results are presented in the below Table 1.

Example 2      The CMS used in Example lb was replaced with potato shaped graphite (PSG), SG25/99.95 SC, of average particle size 20  obtained from NGS Naturgraphit of Germany) with the following results:      38   Prepreg system Technique 2 Technique 1      4 point 2 point      Conductivity S/ni Conductivity S/ni     No disrupted fibres with 0.5 0.4      LQ wt % PSG      Di.smpt.ed fibres by Process 1 with 4.0 3.1      1.0 wt % PSG      Table 2      The prepress of Example 2 were all prepared in the same way as in Examples 1,1a. Additional Examples      Prepregs (20 ni 0.3 m) with different amounts of conductive particles were manufactured on the pilot prepreg line employed in Example LI a, lb by feeding a continuous layer of unidirectional carbon fibres and bringing into contact with two layers of curable resin containing the electrically conductive particles and thermoplastic toiighner pailicles (Rilsan PA 1  or Orgasol PA 6 from Arkema) in a so-called 2 film process.      The potato shaped graphite (PSG) was supplied by NGS Naturgraphit of Germany and are called SG25/99.95 SC and have an average particle size of 20 microns. Another PSG was supplied by Nippon Power Graphite Company of Japan and called GHDR-15-4.      Planar graphites were supplied by Tirncal Ltd of Switzerland and are called Timrex SFG44 and Timrex KS44. These particles have an average particle size of 22 microns. Another planar graphite was supplied by Graphit Kropfmulil of Germany and is called SGA20 M and has an average particle size of 20 microns.      The prepreg was made using IMA carbon fibre at an area! weight of 268 gsm. For resistance panels 12 ply laminates were produced using 0/90 lay-up and cured at 180C for 2 hours in an autoclave at 3 bar pressure.   Prepregs were made by process  or 2. The prepregs made Process 1 were prepared containing the conductive particles wherein the pressure exerted onto the carbon .fibres and resin did not exceed 40 kg per centimetre of the width of the carbon fibre layer. In this case, the disruption of the fibres was much less severe when compared to prepreg prepared by the 2 .film Nip process of .Figure 2 (Process 2). In addition, for comparison, prepregs were made containing no conductive particles but prepared by using rough spreader bars (RSB) on the carbon tows and using Process 2. In addition, for comparison prepregs, made by Process 2 were prepared containing 'planar' conductive particles. Example 3      Tliis product is a prepreg produced on a pilot prepreg line containing an uncured thermosetting resin and a carbon fibre IMA. The area! weight of the fibre was 268 g m<2>. In addition the product contained thermoplastic particles in the form of PA I I in a concentration of 13.5 wt % based on the thermosetting resin.      The product was produced by the Process 2      The impregnated fibre was heated to improve the flow of the resin films into the fibres. Subsequently, the impregnated fibre passed through a set of ""S wrap rollers"" to align the unidirectional fibres and further enhance homogeneity and impregnation of the prepreg material. Subsequently, following heating of the fibres by an IR table to improve resin flow, the material was passed through 3 sets of nip rollers of Figure 2. Finally , the paper backing layers were removed and a polythene backing sheet (polyethylene sheeting) was applied to form the final prepreg product. This is common to all examples employing Process 2.

The areal weight of the fibre is 268 g/nr. In addition the product contained thermoplastic paiticles in the form of PA6 in a concentration of 13.5 wt % based on the thermosetting resin. The prepreg also contained PSG SG25/99.95 SC in a concentration of 1 wt% based on thermosetting resin. Tins product was produced using the (S-wrap) 2 film process.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000040_0001"" />    Table 4      Example 5-9      These prepregs had an area! weight of the fibre of 268 g/ni<2>. These products contained thermoplastic particles in the form of PA I I in a eoiiceiitratioii of 9.5 wt % based on the thermosetting resin. The prepreg also contained PSG SG25/99.95 SC in varying   concentrations of between I to 4 wt% based on thermosetting resin. This product was produced using the (S-wrap) 2 film process of Figure 1.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000041_0001"" />    Table 5      It is shown in Table 5 that iiicreasmg the conieiii of the PSG increases the conductivity of the composite. A maximum conductivity of 29 S m is achieved at 3 wt% loading of PSG. Increasing the loading of the PSG above 3 t% does not improve conductivity value further.   Examples 10 to 12      These prepregs were prepared as in Example 3, using a fibre layer of 268 g ni<2> areal weight These prepregs contained themioplastic particles in the form of PA  having a concentration varying from 9.5 to 13.5 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight. The prepreg contains PSG SG25/99.95 SC in concentrations of between 3 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight. This product was produced using the 2 film Nip process.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000042_0001"" />    Table 6      Table 6 shows by using Process 2 in combination with PSG particles, that conductive values greater than 100 S/m can be achieved. By lowering the themioplastic particle content conductivity can also be increased. Example 13      This prepreg was prepared as for Example 3, using a fibre layer of 268 g/iir areal .weight. The product contained thermoplastic particles in the form of PA 6 in a concentration of 10.5 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight. The prepreg contained PSG   SG25/99.95 SC in a concentration of 3 wt % based on the formulated memiosett g resin weight. This product was produced using the 2 film Nip process.      <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""316748225-imgf000043_0001"" />    Table 7      Table 7 shows by the combination of Process 2 with PSG particles can produce a prepreg with conductivity values greater than 90 S/m. This confirms that using a different thermoplastic particle does not significantly affect conductivity values.      Example 14      This prepreg was prepared as for Example 3, using a fibre of 268 g/m<2> area! weight .

Examples 15 to IS      These prepregs were prepared as for Example 3, using a fibre layer of 268 g/rn<2> areal weight. The product contained thermoplastic particles in the fomi of PA 11 in a concentration of 10.5 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight. The prepregs contained graphite particles with a planar shape rather tha a potato shape, which were applied with a concentration of 3 wt % based on the formulated thermosetting resin weight.

REFERENCE TO GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT      [0002] (none)      REFERENCE TO MICROFICHE APPENDIX      [0003] (none)      FIELD OF THE INVENTION      [0004] The present invention relates to monitoring of living subjects, such as during exercise, and more particularly to exercise monitoring of persons where measured or input exercise data is communicated by a mobile communications device to and from the internet.   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION      [0005] Several attempts have been made in the past to achieve efficient interactive communication of medical or health information between a subject or patient and a reviewer or provider of that information. However, in general, previous systems have limited the user to the general location in which the device was located. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,047, images and data were transmitted by standard telephone lines or wireless telemetry systems.      [0006] Even where devices are portable, as in the case of a laptop computer with a modem, an ordinary POTS phone line must be found and used. Where the user's computer employs a broadband connection, such as DSL or satellite, the choices of location are even more limited.      [0007] Attempts have been made to remedy this deficiency. As noted above, some telemetry systems allow a ""wireless"" distance to be placed between a health measuring unit and a remote monitoring system. However, such systems are limited in their range.      [0008] Other systems have used cellular telephone technology to increase the wireless health monitoring range. However, these systems have several deficiencies, such as requiring significant modification of the mobile phone. For example, U.S. Pat. No.      5,772,586, issued Jun. 30, 1998 to Heinonon et al, discloses a method for monitoring the health of a patient. This system uses a specialized connection between the patient health measuring unit and the cellular phone, however. The patient health measuring unit is located in the battery space of the mobile phone and is connected to a communication bus of the mobile phone. Other systems have been proposed, but these suffer from similar deficiencies in that they require specially modified cellular phones to be employed.      [0009] The deployment of the above systems also currently lacks employment of full back-end server functionality with which to provide a wide range of interactive communication with the patient. Instead, such systems, if internet-enabled, are often limited to mere one-way non-interactive data transfer via a modem.   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION      [0010] Embodiments of the present invention overcome one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a full-feature health and exercise monitoring system that may wirelessly connect to a back-end server application via the internet. The invention allows wireless access to and from a wide variety of present exercise or health-related instruments and devices, while maintaining the capability of connecting to future such devices.      [0011] The advent of multimedia mobile phones and other personal communications devices that include a digital camera, or are able to connect with one, allows the capture and transmission of health and exercise information, including images. In embodiments of the present invention, multimedia mobile phones are used to transmit voice and images as well as data from an exercise monitoring device. In addition to the uploading of images, the display screen of a wireless internet device (""WID""), such as a smart phone, is used to allow the display of images such as illustrations, diagrams or video clips which may be downloaded from a server as part of an interactive user interface (e.g., for the purpose of describing to a user how to set up an exercise regime). The ability to include images in a system that is based on a WID connected to a exercise monitoring device helps facilitate the remote analysis and monitoring of exercise, fitness, nutrition, or health.      [0012] The reviewer or provider of exercise or health information is understood to include not only the user but also a trainer, coach, specialist, caregiver, physician, another user, or a software application or algorithm that may analyze the information. The information can include data from a variety of monitoring devices and images relating to the condition of the user. The images could include photographs or videos of the user's specific situation that could aid their exercise regime.      [0013] In particular, the invention may be embodied in several systems. Two      complementary such systems are described herein, although extensions to other such systems can be envisioned. In the first embodiment, a health or lifestyle management plan may be implemented. Various exercise parameters, such as those relating to fitness, nutrition or exercise, may be received from an exercise monitoring device, and the same   may be wirelessly communicated to a server. The exercise parameters may include physiological data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, or temperature; or data corresponding to the amount of exercise performed, such as number of miles traveled, how much work performed, or the like. In some cases, derived data, such as number of calories burned, may also be measured by an appropriate calculation. An application may process, store, and perform calculations on the exercise parameters, these may be reported back to the user, and a health, nutrition, or fitness specialist or other reviewer may optionally review the same or different derived or measured values. The second embodiment of the invention may be employed to manage the disease state or condition of a patient. In this embodiment, the patient, or a caregiver, may employ a health monitoring device (""HMD""), in particular a medical device, and a wireless connection to provide data from the medical device for processing via the internet, including a review by a physician or other health care professional if required.      [0014] In other embodiments, the condition of subjects may be evaluated by collecting exercise, health, or medical data and providing information in response to those data by means of a WID designed to display interactive information through a connection to the Internet. The present invention may be connected to various HMDs, and may      communicate information via a wireless connection such as a wireless Internet connection. The user of the present invention may be the subject, or another person such as a trainer, coach, or physician. Wireless internet connectivity has many advantages. For example, in the first embodiment, a person interested in tracking an exercise program may take the WID to the local health club and attach the same to an exercise machine, send data output from various exercise machines over the Internet, which may include data relating to how much exercise or work was performed, and physiological data such as heart rate, and receive a personalized response from an application program running on a server. The individual may input caloric content of foods eaten, and may further input caloric content of exercise performed. In this way, e.g., a person in a weight-loss program may see in great detail whether they are expending more calories in the form of exercise than the same individual is consuming in the form of food. Alternatively, in the second embodiment, a diabetic could connect a blood glucose meter to a WID away from home   and download data to a Diabetes Management Company's server and, in response, receive guidance displayed on the screen (or by voice) about choices for the next meal.      [0015] In general, in the health management embodiment, the system may be employed to monitor the physiological status of a healthy subject while exercising, or performing other activities by receiving data from a variety of exercise monitors that provide physiological data and/or data corresponding to the amount of exercise or work performed. Exercise monitors that provide physiological data may include heart rate monitors, respiration rate monitors, blood pressure monitors, accelerometers, pedometers, body weight scales, body fat gauges, biofeedback devices, physiotherapy or chiropractic equipment, or the like, and the same may be separate devices or devices incorporated within an exercise machine. Exercise machines may include, e.g., treadmills, rowing machines, steppers, other aerobic or anaerobic exercise equipment, weight machines, or any other type of exercise machine. Exercise data corresponding to an amount of exercise performed may be measured by such machines and sent to the WID as described. For clarity, such devices are termed herein ""exercise monitors"" or ""exercise monitoring devices"" and the same measure ""exercise parameters"" or ""exercise data"". Exercise parameters or data may include the above physiological data and/or data corresponding to an amount of exercise or work performed.      [0016] In more detail, embodiments of the present invention provide a method and system for assisting subjects to maintain a healthy lifestyle by collecting and transmitting exercise data and in turn receiving information in response to those data by means of a WID designed to display interactive information through a connection to the Internet. The present invention may be connected to various HMDs, both medical and exercise-related in nature, and may communicate information via a wireless connection such as a wireless Internet connection.      [0017] A major advantage of embodiments of the invention is that the same frees the patient from the constraints of wired systems. The same allows users with consumer ""off- the-shelf wireless devices, e.g. mobile phone, to significantly extend the range of connectivity over that of wired computers, or even wireless telemetry systems.   [0018] The WID may be a web-enabled mobile phone. Alternatively, the WID may be a PDA, palm, handheld, tablet, netbook, or laptop computer, equipped with a wireless modem. Besides these, the WID may be a hybrid device that combines the functions of a computer, PDA and telephone in some fashion. It should also be noted that the WID may be a web-enabled mobile phone or hybrid device using a satellite communications network.      [0019] In a separate embodiment, an adaptor is used if necessary to convert the output signal of the exercise monitoring device to a suitable input signal for the, e.g., WID. The adaptor allows connection of the WID to an exercise monitor, either separately or one that forms part of an exercise machine or other variety of health care equipment, and the connection may be made via several techniques.      [0020] As for wired techniques, a standard parallel bus, universal serial bus (USB), Firewire, serial cable, or similar industry-standard connection may be used if the input/output ports between the HMD and the WID are appropriate. Otherwise, a suitable separate adaptor may be employed.      [0021] The connection may also be an input such as a memory device reader, a disk drive or other media input for input of data, a USB port or phone jack or other such wired input, again employing an adaptor if required.      [0022] As for wireless techniques, infrared (IR), microwaves, radio frequency (RF), a variety of cellular protocols, a variety of 802.11 protocols, 802.15 protocols, 802.16 protocols, 802.20 protocols, other IEEE 802 family protocols, short range wireless transmission, wide area network or broadband transmission methods, such as      Bluetooth, wireless universal serial bus protocols (W-USB), WiFi, WiMax, WiFiMax, Long Term Evolution (LTE), ultrawideband protocols (UWB), Voice over IP (VOIP), or satellite communication protocols or other wireless protocols, or optical techniques including lasers, may be employed. As above, an adapter is used if necessary to convert the output of an exercise device to a suitable wireless signal for the WID, for example, a Bluetooth virtual serial cable.   [0023] The user, or other person such as a trainer, may also input data manually, such as by a stylus, keypad, touch screen, synchronization from a PC, or by various other techniques discussed below. Such a capability may be especially useful for the input of food data, e.g., caloric content consumed, or the like.      [0024] A major advantage of the invention is that by use of an optional adaptor, the system is compatible with current and prior HMDs as well as maintaining a capability of adapting to future such systems.      [0025] A digital camera may be integral to the WID to provide photographic or video images to supplement the data from the HMD. Alternatively, the WID may be connected to a camera either through a wired or wireless connection. The HMD may also provide image data (e.g., exercise machine on-screen signals could be transmitted visually if an output connection is not available).      [0026] The interaction between a WID and a back-end server may provide a major additional advantage in certain embodiments of the invention. In particular, the relatively small amount of memory currently provided on a WID as compared to a back-end server limits the functionality of applications running on the WID, especially in terms of computing capacity, processing power, and user interface. By providing significant application functionality on the back-end, less memory and processing capabilities become necessary on the WID (i.e., on the ""front-end""). Thus, memory may be used in the WID for an enhanced user interface or for other purposes, according to the user requirements. The invention is protocol-independent.      [0027] In a method according to an embodiment of the invention, the user connects to a specific Internet site and a software program, resident on a computer readable medium such as a hard disk drive, flash memory, permanent disk storage such as a DVD-ROM, firmware, or the like, on a remote server located on the Internet, downloads an interactive user interface for that patient or subject user and an application for the measurement of the exercise information or that allows, enables, controls, or otherwise provides for the transfer of information from the exercise monitor to the WID. Alternatively, the software may have been previously installed on the WID by a supplier or a from a memory device,   or downloaded to a computer readable medium of the WID such as an internal memory storage, or in another manner as is known in the art, from a personal computer or wireless access point or via other wireless download technologies via a synchronization operation in known fashion.      [0028] The software provides a personalized display for the user and configures the WID to control and monitor devices connected via a generic input/output port to the WID. The software may be designed to suit the constraints of the small display screens of WIDs. The software, as well as inputs from the user or other inputs, can control the manner, content, and display of information presented to the user, and measured or input data can be stored for review by the user, a trainer, coach, health care professional, other user, or be processed further by a software algorithm or application. The algorithm may be of varying complexity, from a simple program that merely provides a response to the user, to an artificial intelligence algorithm, such as an expert system, collaborative filtering system, rules-based system, case-based reasoning system, or other such artificial intelligence application.      [0029] Further information may be provided to or from the user, including information entered manually, e.g., calories consumed or exercise performed. The user may input this information directly on the WID or via a personal computer, which then may download the input information to the WID via a synchronization operation using standard protocols, such as those for smart phone devices.      [0030] The user may also input supplemental information via a PC connected independently to the server via the internet. Alternatively, the user may input this information via connection with another device using standard protocols, wired or wireless connections including a variety of 8021.1 1 protocols, a variety of 8021.15 protocols, a variety of 802.16 protocols or wireless transmission methods such as Bluetooth, WiFi, WiMax, WiFiMax, or infrared wireless connections. In addition, a Global Positioning System (GPS) device can be used to provide data about the location of the user. The GPS information can be used to calculate an exercise parameter corresponding to the amount of exercise performed, e.g., by tracking the distance travelled.   [0031] The use of a WID equipped with a ""hands-free"" earpiece and microphone allows the user to interact with the trainer, coach, or health care professional while recording exercise data. The use of a camera-equipped mobile phone further allows the trainer or health care professional to instruct the user to send photographs or video to assist in the exercise performance or analysis. The deployment of voice processing technology may be used to allow an even more convenient user interface.      In all of these respects, the portable aspect of the WID is important: to wit, the user may conveniently carry the WID on their person wherever they go, allowing data entry at the time needed or as is convenient. A wearable WID such as implemented by a smart watch, eyewear, article of clothing, or other device or configured to be worn by a person, makes it even more convenient for a user to carry the WID on their person.      [0032] A, trainer, coach, or other person reviewing the data may also input supplemental information via a PC connected independently to the server via the internet to supplement the data input to the WID.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS      [0042] Various acronyms are used for clarity herein. Definitions are given below.      The term ""HMD"" may encompass not only devices with physiological and exercise data sensors but also devices with a keypad, keyboard, mouse, touch screen, pointer, pressure sensor, or other such inputs that the patient or user may employ to perform data entry of the desired parameters. In general, HMDs include some means for determining an exercise or health parameter. For receiving physiological data, an HMD may be a heart rate monitor, a blood pressure monitor, an ambulatory ECG recorder, a respiratory monitor, a temperature monitor and so on.      [0043] For receiving exercise data corresponding to the amount of exercise performed, an HMD may be an exercise monitor such as a pedometer, accelerometer, biofeedback device, or other sensor tracking duration, rate, intensity or total amount of exercise, such as number of miles traveled. In a healthy lifestyle management embodiment, an HMD may be incorporated within an exercise machine, including treadmills, rowers, steppers, exercise cycles, or other aerobic or anaerobic exercisers, the same providing exercise data corresponding to the amount of exercise performed such as number of miles traveled,   duration of exercise or rate of work performed, and the same may provide physiological data such as heart rate, and additional derived data such as the number of calories.      [0044] The term ""subject"" as used herein primarily indicates a human subject. The same may be, a person interested in maintaining health via accurate recording of exercise, fitness, and nutrition, and so on, or a medical patient under a physician's care or the care of another healthcare professional The term ""user"" is generally used to refer to a user of the WID, which may be synonymous with the subject or may alternatively be another person using a similar WID to review the data from the first user. A user may also be a trainer, fitness coach, physician monitoring an exercise program, or the like. The term ""patient"" is used, in addition to a person under the care of a physician, to also refer to a ""normal"" or healthy individual who is interested in maintaining a healthy physiological balance.      [0045] The term ""signal communication"" is used to mean any type of connection between components where the connection is, e.g., electromagnetic, and where the connection allows information to be passed from one component to another. This term may be used in a similar fashion as ""coupled"", ""connected"", ""information communication"", ""data communication"", etc. The following are examples of signal communication schemes. As for wired techniques, a standard USB or serial cable may be used if the input/output ports are compatible and an optional adaptor may be employed if they are not. As for wireless techniques, examples of employable techniques include: infrared (IR), microwaves, radio frequency (RF), a variety of cellular protocols, a variety of 802.1 1 protocols, 802.15 protocols, 802.16 protocols, 802.20 protocols, other IEEE 802 family protocols, short range wireless transmission, wide area network or broadband transmission methods, such as Bluetooth, wireless universal serial bus protocols (W-USB), WiFi, WiMax, WiFiMax, Long Term Evolution (LTE), VOIP, ultrawideband protocols (UWB), satellite communication protocols or other wireless protocols, or optical techniques including lasers. The user may also input data manually, such as by a stylus or keypad, touchpad or by various other techniques discussed above and below.      [0046] The term ""generic input/output port"" is used to mean any type of conventional, standard, universal, stock, consumer, or ""off-the-shelf port for data input and output.   These may include both wired and wireless ports and may be located externally or internally to the WID. A further description is given below.      [0047] Various embodiments of the invention are now described in more detail.      [0048] Referring to FIG. 1, a system is shown for monitoring exercise data from a patient or subject 38. The system includes a wireless exercise monitoring apparatus (""WEMA"") 10 described in further detail below. WEMA 10 is linked in a wireless fashion to a wireless connection point of presence (""POP"") 19, the same including at least a base station antenna 15 coupled to a server 17. Server 17 is in turn connected to the wired, or even a wireless (not shown) Internet 21, which may include the World Wide Web.      [0049] It should be noted that the base station embodiment shown in FIG. 1 may be replaced or removed for mobile phones which connect via satellite i.e., ""satellite phones"", rather than via a cellular network or other wireless communication.      [0050] Referring to FIG. 2, a first embodiment of WEMA 10 is shown. WEMA 10 includes an HMD 11 , which may include an optional monitor screen 40, coupled via an optional adaptor 42 to a WID 12. WID 12 connects wirelessly via an antenna 60 to base station 15 (see FIG. 1). One function of WID 12 may be to provide the user interface; other functions are described below.      [0051] As noted above, HMD 1 1 may include a physiological sensor 24 which connects to the HMD via a connection 44 (or which may alternatively connect directly to the WID) or a sensor 24' tracking an amount of exercise performed that connects to the WID (or HMD) via a connection 44'; or may include a manual system 36 for input of      physiological and exercise data via a connection 34. Manual system 36 may also be used to input data directly into WID 12 via a connection 32. Manual system 36 may include, e.g., a keyboard or keypad 30, a mouse 26, a pen-type device 28, touch screen 28' and may also employ a separate monitor (not shown). Of course, the user may also view information on monitor 40 or on a screen 41 of WID 12. In many embodiments, the touch screen or keypad system employed by many current mobile phones such as the iPhone, may be preferred for such manual data input.   [0052] Data may also be input via entry on a computer 37. This data may then be synchronized to WID 12 in known fashion. Alternatively, computer 37, or another computer may be used to connect to a server using the wired internet. This use may be particularly advantageous when entering a large amount of data. As noted above, in this way the user may be afforded a more convenient environment in which to manipulate data to supplement the data input to the WID.      [0053] It will be clear to one of skill in the art given this teaching that cable 32, as well as cables 34 and 44, may be replaced with wireless circuitry to communicate signals wirelessly. Alternatively, cables 34 or 44 may be replaced by a direct plug and socket connection. In this connection, adaptor 42 may be a direct plug and socket connection.      [0054] For exercise devices and applications, physiological sensor 24 may include, e.g., a sensor appropriate for measuring heart rate, respiration, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen levels, blood pressure, electrocardiograms (ECG), or any other desired physiological parameter. Sensor 24 may also include a camera configured as a heart pulse monitor by detecting color or heat changes. Sensor 24 may connect via an optional cable 44 to subject 38. Alternatively, sensor 24 may be distal of HMD 11, i.e., at or within subject 38. In other words, if cable 44 is employed, sensor 24 may be proximal or distal of cable 44. In some applications, such as some types of cardiac monitoring, sensor 24 is implanted within the patient. The sensor 24' tracking the exercise performed may include, e.g. a pedometer, accelerometer, biofeedback device, timer, GPS device, or other sensor tracking duration, rate, intensity or total amount of exercise. Either or both the physiological sensor and/or sensor tracking the amount of exercise may be incorporated in exercise machines such as a treadmill, exercise bicycle, stepper and so forth.      Alternatively, other exercise monitors may also be employed so long as the measured data may either be transferred to WID 12, e.g., via optional adaptor 42, described in further detail below, or by being read by a user, e.g., from a display, and manually input to the WID.      [0055] If a wireless communications capability is added, sensor 24 or sensor 24' need not physically connect with HMD 11 or WID 12 at all. That is, the same may measure an exercise parameter and may communicate the same to WEMA 10 wirelessly. The short-   range wireless communications schemes which may be employed include infrared, radio frequency including a variety of 802.15 protocols such as Bluetooth, a variety of 802.11 protocols such as WiFi or any other such wireless transmission schemes, including those described above.      [0056] As examples of sensor types, to measure heart rate, sensor 24 may be placed via a chest band or an adhesive sensor disposed on the chest. As an example of sensor type 24' to measure the amount of exercise performed, a pedometer may be disposed on the user to track the number of miles travelled. Other exercise monitors may also be employed so long as the measured data may either be transferred to WID 12, e.g., via optional adaptor 42, described in further detail below, or by being read by a user, e.g., from a display, and manually input to WID 12. Alternatively, the measured data may be transferred to WID 12 via wireless communication schemes, using a variety of 802.15 protocols such as Bluetooth, a variety of 802.1 1 protocols such as WiFi, infrared, optical, microwaves, etc., directly from sensor 24 or sensor 24' or from HMD 1 1 as described in greater detail below. HMD 1 1 may be a wearable device, such as a watch in wireless communication with sensor 24, e.g. a heart rate chest band; or sensor 24 can be integrated with the watch, e.g. a resident pulse monitor. Sensor 24 may also be integrated in an article of clothing, e.g. smart apparel. The wearable device may communicate wirelessly with WID 12, e.g. a mobile phone, or with the Internet 11 directly via other transceiver means.      [0057] . The user, who may or may not be the same person as subject 38, may input data to WID 12 to supplement the measured data. For example, in a health or exercise system, if subject 38 consumes a known number of calories, this information may be entered via manual system 36 directly into WID 12 or into HMD 1 1. Further, the user, the subject, and the sensor are not necessarily the sole sources of information. Data stored on the server, or on a separate server operated for health management, may also be employed to result in a health benefit to subject 38.      [0058] The data used to benefit the subject 38 may be from a camera as well as from an HMD. Referring to FIG. 3, an embodiment of a WID 244 is shown equipped with a camera 224 and an optional memory device 246. The camera may be integral to the WID,   or may be separate and connected via a cable. The camera may be incorporated in a wearable WID, e.g smart      [0059] Particularly important types of visual data about a user that may be wirelessly transmitted from the WID are those corresponding to photographic pictures, both still and video, and graphical or visual data output images from an HMD, e.g., an exercise machine. In either case, a trainer, coach, or medical personnel may use such data to take appropriate action.      [0060] To obtain the first type of data noted above, photographic data, a camera may be employed, which is either resident on the WID or is otherwise available by way of a wired or wireless link. The WID may store photographic data, either still or video, and transmit the same wirelessly to a point of collection, e.g., a server application, or may save the photographic data on the memory device or in other device storage for contemporaneous or later transmission, again either via a streamed, non-streamed, or other transmission method. The WID may be in the form of a wearable device equipped with a camera, e.g. eyewear or watch. As noted above, the WID may connect with a physiological sensor 24, e.g. a distal or integrated pulse monitor, and with a sensor 24' to measure the amount of exercise performed, e.g. a distal or integrated GPS device.      [0061] There are various ways in which visual data may be communicated to a remote reviewer. A simple method is to send the visual data via an email message. In more advanced methods, the visual data may be integrated with a data stream of other medical information. Current systems may be used in combination with the present invention to facilitate the handling and transmission of visual data by a WID. In all cases, the visual data may be stored, e.g., as a separate file or may be included as an embedded object in a data file on the memory device or in an email.      [0062] In more detail, a data port from a HMD that is coupled to a user may be employed to send visual information from the same to an input port on the WID. This transmission may be accomplished via the techniques described above. Such data may be in either a raw form or in a preformatted-for-video form, and may be stored in the WID or on the memory device. In either case, it may be required to format the data in a way suitable for   the display screen of the WID. In some cases, viewing on the WID is not necessary, and the data may be sent in its original form, optionally undergoing some intermediate processing, directly on to the trainer, coach or other remote reviewer's system for viewing or analysis. Examples of this type of data may pertain to the performance of exercise data or other sources of data. The remoter reviewer may include another user, similarly equipped with a WID, e.g. when the users are engaged in team activities.      [0063] Alternatively, a subset of the data may be sent, such as a compressed version, while the remainder, i.e., the complete version of the user data, may be maintained on the WID and/or memory device for purposes of maintaining a complete user record.      [0064] The memory device 246 may be a smartcard, a smartmedia card, a memory card, memory stick, compact flash card, memory cubes, micro-drives, disk-on-keys, flash memory-keys, micro-laser disks, nano-storage devices, bio-memories, battery/memory combination device, USB flash drives, and so on, or indeed any other type of removable media that may be connected to a WID to store information. Typically, these memory devices are capable of storing substantial amounts of data. The same may also include a memory and power source or combination device. In another embodiment, the memory device 246 may be inserted (not shown) in a memory device reader, which is in turn connected to a WID via a link.      [0065] Of course, in some devices, including some current smart mobile phones or other wireless mobile devices such as netbooks, there is no need for a separate memory device 246 as the internal storage capacity, e.g. in the form of solid state memory, microdrive or other memory storage devices, is sufficient to store all applications and data. Whether via a memory device 246 or internal storage, enhanced functionality and storage are provided for the WIDs 244 or 250. This may be particularly important for exercise data, as certain physiological monitoring apparatuses produce copious amounts of data, e.g., cardiac monitoring equipment, and thus require substantial storage capabilities. This is particularly true for memory-intensive video and multimedia content.      [0066] Another reason such memory devices are particularly pertinent in medical device monitoring is that they store data which can then be wirelessly transmitted in a streamed   or non-streamed fashion. In the event of drop-outs, interruptions, or unavailability of the wireless network, no loss of data occurs, as the data has been stored on the memory device and may be wirelessly transmitted at a later time when cellular or mobile service is again available. The memory device thus serves as a backup storage media. In the event of an extended period of unavailability of a wireless network, the memory device may be replaced or overwritten to provide practically unlimited storage until such time as the network is available and the data can be uploaded. In more detail, in the case of a dropout or other disruption of wireless service, the data may be stored on the memory device or in the WID if it has not already been, as may be the case for streamed data. The WID may periodically test for the availability of the wireless network, and may wait until the network is available. Once the system is again available, the advice from the trainer, coach or other reviewer may be sent to the WID and the user may again take action.      [0067] Of course, even if the wireless network is available, the memory device or onboard WID memory may store the data for various purposes. This real-time capability and robustness is often very important in ensuring user safety and ensuring that a high level of care is being delivered to the user by the trainer, coach, or medical personnel, particularly in field situations, such as running or, bicycling, where the wireless connection may be the only source of communication. A related reason why memory devices are particularly pertinent in exercise device monitoring is that they allow a greater level of buffering for real-time data monitoring, thus allowing more pre-analysis and filtering of data.      [0068] A further benefit of the use of memory devices is that they provide for easy application downloading onto a WID. For example, a memory device may be inserted into a WID and a large application program may be easily downloaded onto the computer-readable media of a WID from the memory device rather than through a wired or wireless synchronization or downloading process via a PC or the internet or both. Appropriate types of computer-readable media have been described above. Downloading in this fashion may be particularly rapid and complete. The downloaded data may include visual data, such as still or video photographic images, that instruct a user on the operation of a device. In an alternative embodiment, visual data need not be downloaded but may rather be streamed, either from a stored video on a server or in real-time via a user with a webcam. In downloaded or streamed but generally not live systems, the user   interface may be interactive, allowing the user to access a knowledge database resident on the server or memory device or previously downloaded onto the memory of the WID.      [0069] Referring to FIG. 4, WEMA 10 is shown communicating wirelessly with the Internet. In doing so, WEMA 10 generally sends a wireless signal to a base station 14 (in known fashion) that is connected to a server 18 that is in signal communication (in known fashion) with the internet 20. Server 18 communicates via a protocol (in known fashion) to Internet 20, which also communicates via a protocol (in known fashion) to a server 22 running an application 62. Server 22 may be accessed (in known fashion) by a client computer 44 through a connection 64.      [0070] As noted, the protocols for data communication are known. They include a variety of cellular protocols, a variety of 802.1 1 protocols, 802.15 protocols, 802.16 protocols, 802.20 protocols, other IEEE 802 family protocols, wide area network or broadband transmission methods, WiFi, WiMax, WiFiMax, Long Term Evolution (LTE), VOIP, ultrawideband protocols (UWB), or other wireless communication protocols, and may include a satellite instead of ground-based communication systems. However, they currently vary amongst known techniques. The present invention is not limited to any particular protocols, and may be implemented in any languages supported by the WID and server. In particular, the wireless communications schemes envisioned by the present invention include cellular, mobile, satellite, and other such wireless techniques. In such wireless communication systems, an additional security layer may be employed, including industry-standard encryption and decryption of the transmitted data, especially as health information is highly sensitive and private data.      [0071] Of course, as computing capabilities continue to increase, it is expected that the capabilities of WEMA 10, servers 18 and 22, as well as application 62 and client 44, and other components, will correspondingly increase.      [0072] Application 62 running on server 22 which is stored in computer readable media as described above may interact with WEMA 10 in a number of ways. Referring to FIG. 5, WEMA 10 is shown in signal communication with server 22 via a connection 72. Connection 72 schematically represents the wireless Internet connection and intervening   pathways. WEMA 10 includes an application that may be viewed as having two components: a base wireless or device application 70 and an application presentation layer or user interface 68. User interface 68 is employed to, e.g., present a menu of options to the user, to allow the user to choose inputs, and to generally operate the device. User interface 68 may vary widely in sophistication, e.g., from a simple data entry field to a full graphical user interface. These applications may accept as inputs data from a sensor 24 and sensor 24' as well as from a manual input 36.      [0073] Server 22 has a base server application 62 stored on computer-readable media as described above with which the same calculates or provides a response based at least in part on data from WEMA 10. Application 62 may include an algorithm 63 for analyzing data from the HMD, and either application 62 or algorithm 63 may optionally access data from an external data source 74 and may further consult an artificial intelligence system 76. Server 22 may be accessed by a remote computing device 37' by the subject user, a trainer, coach, or any other reviewer.      [0074] External data source 74 may be a memory or disk or other such storage that stores health data, such as healthy and unhealthy weight/height ranges, healthy and unhealthy cholesterol counts, the user's prior medical or health history, healthy and unhealthy heart rate values, information corresponding to the caloric and other nutritional content of foods, information corresponding to the caloric expenditure values of various exercises, algorithms for calculating various health parameters, etc. In general, any data that may benefit the health of a user may be stored in external data source 74. External data source 74 may be a memory device or other such storage that stores supplemental data such as treatment protocols. In general, any data that may benefit or otherwise affects the health condition of a user may be stored in external data source 74. External data source 74 may also include online access of health information from external databases or other sources.      [0075] As noted, application 62 or algorithm 63 may also consult AI system 76 for suggestions as to health benefits. AI system 76 may even interact with external data source 74 to extract useful information from the same. AI system 76 may employ, e.g., case-based reasoning, rules-based systems, collaborative filtering, neural networks, expert systems, or other such systems as are known.   [0076] It should also be noted that each of application 62, algorithm 63, external data source 74, or AI system 76, may physically reside on more than one server, e.g., on an array of servers for, e.g., storage or multiple processing purposes. Each of application 62, algorithm 63, external data source 74, or AI system 76, or combinations of each, may also respectively reside on different servers.      [0077] The extent to which server application 62 interacts with wireless application 70 depends on the use to which the system is put. For example, in a less interactive embodiment, device application 70 may act to measure a user's heart rate during exercise and report the same to server application 62. In this case, a trainer may simply review the measured value and send the user a response reporting that the value is acceptable or not. In a highly interactive embodiment, a user may have numerous HMDs 1 1 measuring a variety of physiological data and/or other data tracking the amount of exercise performed, connected via optional adaptors to a WID 12, and wireless application 70 may correspondingly send a large amount of exercise data to server application 62. The trainer, coach, or physician accessing server application 62, may in turn send detailed plans for an exercise regimen via connection 72. The received data may be analyzed using algorithm 63, external data source 74, and AI system 76. In this sense, the two applications may be highly interactive.      [0078] It is noted that an Application Service Provider (ASP) may operate application 62. That is, application 62 may be leased by an ASP to a company specializing in fitness or lifestyle management, and the ASP may perform all necessary upgrades and maintenance to application 62 and its associated components.      [0079] To initialize the system, the program starts and a wireless application is loaded into computer readable media in the WID, if it has not been pre-loaded. The initial loading of the wireless application may occur via synchronization from a desktop or via downloading from a server over the internet. The server application may be loaded into computer readable media in an appropriate internet-connected server. Subject data may be loaded into the WID or into the server application. In the latter case, the subject information may later be transferred to the WID. The initialization scheme then ends.   [0080] The wireless application may access the server and server application, or vice- versa, as determined by the respective program instructions.      [0081] Referring to FIG. 6, a flowchart of a method is shown for a system of exercise, fitness, nutrition or health monitoring, and/or exercise management. In this example, the HMD is in the form of a general exercise machine such as a treadmill, stepper, exercise bicycle and so forth. An exercise monitor may be integral to the exercise machine or may be separate.      [0082] In the method, both exercise data and visual data may be wirelessly transmitted from the WID. Visual data include that corresponding to photographic pictures, both still and video, and graphical or visual data output images from an HMD, e.g., an exercise machine or equipment display screen, or other images related to the exercise being performed. A trainer or coach may review these images and use them to guide the user as appropriate as described below.      [0083] After the start (step 242) of the method, a user interacts with a WID (step 240). By the interaction, visual data may be captured (step 241 '), and/or the user may send supplemental data to the server and server application (step 241).      [0084] To obtain the visual data noted above, photographic data, a camera may be employed, which is either resident on the WID (camera 224 of FIG. 3) or is otherwise available by way of a link. The WID may store photographic data, either still or video, and transmit the same wirelessly to a point of collection, e.g., a server application, or may save the photographic data on the memory device for contemporaneous or later transmission, again either via a streamed, non-streamed, or other transmission method (step 208 of FIG. 6).      [0085] Also after the program is started (step 242), a sensor measures an exercise parameter (step 216), where the exercise parameter corresponds to physiological data or to data corresponding to the amount of exercise performed.   [0086] The exercise monitor sensor may send the parameter to the exercise machine (step 218) or the parameter may be sent directly to the WID (step 218'). It is understood here that the ""sensor"" may pertain to any of the exercise monitors discussed above.      [0087] If the parameter is sent to the exercise machine as an intermediate step, the exercise machine then sends the parameter to the WID (step 220). In any case, the WID wirelessly communicates the parameter to the application server (step 222), e.g., via the wireless web.      [0088] An alternative and complementary way of entering the parameter is by user input. For example, the user may enter the parameter into the exercise machine or into the WID. This parameter may correspond to an amount of exercise performed, an amount of food consumed, etc. Such data and other types are termed supplemental data, and may be transmitted to the server and server application (step 241). Calculations by the server application may take into account the supplemental data as well as the visual data and exercise data.      [0089] The server application processes the parameter (step 224 and optionally step 225), and calculates a response (step 226) based at least in part on the parameter. The server application may optionally employ external data (step 232) or an AI system (step 234) in the calculation. The application server then sends the response to the WID (step 228), where the response is displayed (step 230). Alternatively, the application server may sends the response to an alternate WID (step 228'), such as that of a coach or teammate, where the response is displayed (step 230').      [0090] The same definitional statements regarding the terms ""response"", ""calculate"", ""sensor"", etc., as given before, apply in this embodiment as well.      [0091] As an optional step, a trainer, coach, or other specialist may notify the user of the response (step 238) after having the same displayed on their client computer (step 236). The specialist may be replaced in this example by an application that may also include an algorithm.   [0092] To devise the exercise data mentioned above, a data port from a HMD that is coupled to a user may be employed to send information from the same to an input port on the WID. This transmission may be accomplished via the techniques described above. Such data may be in either a raw form or in a preformatted-for-video form, and may be stored in the WID or on the memory device. In either case, it may be required to format the data in a way suitable for the display screen of the WID. In some cases, viewing on the WID is not necessary, and the data may be sent in its original form, optionally undergoing some intermediate processing, directly on to the remote reviewer's system for viewing or analysis. Examples of this type of data may be the display output of an exercise machine or other sources of data. Alternatively, a subset of the data may be sent, such as a compressed version, while the remainder, i.e., the complete version of the user's data, may be maintained on the WID and/or memory device for purposes of maintaining a complete user record.      [0093] The WID may store the HMD data, and transmit the same wirelessly to a point of collection or may save the data on the memory device for contemporaneous or later transmission, again either via a streamed or other transmission method. The memory device may be any type of computer-readable media, including, e.g., a smartcard, a smartmedia card, a memory card, memory stick, compact flash card, memory cubes, micro-drives, disk-on-keys, flash memory-keys, micro-laser disks, nano-storage devices, bio-memories, battery/memory combination device, USB flash drives, and so on, or indeed any other type of removable media that may be connected to a WID to store information.      [0094] In the case of a dropout or other disruption of wireless service, the data may be stored on the memory device or in the WID if it has not already been, as may be the case for streamed data. The WID may periodically test for the availability of the wireless network, and may wait until the network is available. Once the system is again available, the advice from the caregiver may be sent to the WID and the on-site personnel may again take action.   [0095] Using such data, an off-site trainer, coach, or other health care professional may give the user valuable guidance and advice. Moreover, no wired or dedicated connection is necessary.      [0096] More particularly, for visual data, there are various ways in which such data may be communicated to an off-site reviewer. A simple method is to send the visual data via an email message. In more advanced methods, the visual data may be integrated with a data stream of other information. Current systems may be used in combination with the present invention to facilitate the handling and transmission of visual data by a WID. In all cases, the visual data may be stored, e.g., as a separate file or may be included as an embedded object in a data file on the memory device or in an email.      Adaptor Hardware      [0097] A description is given below of a particular type of adaptor hardware. As noted above, the adaptor may optionally be used to connect a HMD to a WID.      [0098] In general, a connection is necessary between a HMD 1 1 and a WID. The nature of this connection may vary. For example, the connection may be wired or wireless. For wired systems, the connection may be direct or an adaptor may be employed, either on one or both ends of the direct wired connection, to adapt the signal appropriately. In the same way, for wireless systems, the connection may be direct, if both HMD and WID employ the same wireless protocol, or an adaptor may be involved to modify the signal of one or both devices. These connections, all of which are encompassed by the present invention, are discussed in more detail below.      [0100] Referring to FIG. 7, an embodiment of the connection is shown. In this figure, a hardware (or ""wired"") connection is shown, i.e., an adaptor 168, disposed between a HMD 160 and a WID 162. The HMD 160 may connect to an exercise machine via a connector 52 with optional adaptor 124. This connection may also be wireless as has been described. In most circumstances, it is assumed that the varieties of HMDs will vary more widely than the varieties of WIDs. Accordingly, HMD 160 will likely have one of a variety of types of connectors for input/output purposes, here shown as a connector 164. Connector 164 mates with a connector 172 of adaptor 168. At another point on adaptor   168 is a connector 172' for connecting to a generic input/output port 164' on WID 162. A cable 170 is disposed between the two connectors, cable 170 capable of including adaptor circuitry if desired.      [0101] Of course, the use and structure of adaptor 168, between HMD 160 and WID 162, depends on factors such as the prevalence of an industry standard for such      communications. In other words, if the output of HMD 160 is readily acceptable to WID 162, then the same may be directly connected or may be connected via a simple cable, the same basically extending from pin-to-pin. For example, a standard Universal Serial Bus (USB) or serial cable (RS232) may be used if the input/output ports between the HMD and the WID are compatible. Otherwise, a suitable adaptor circuit that provides for appropriate signal and pin conversion may be employed. For example, a standard USB- to-serial (RS232) cable or the like may be used as required. The connection may also be an input for data, e.g. a USB port or phone jack or other such wired input, or a media storage device, again employing an adaptor circuit if required.      [0102] Port 164 can be used to communicate with HMD 160 and connector 164 via a number of types of wired connections, including USB, or Firewire. In some cases, optional adaptor 168 may also be employed.      [0103] In other embodiments, such as for devices connected to proprietary connectors, a less standard and perhaps proprietary pin-out may be required.      [0104] Referring to FIG. 8, an embodiment of a wireless implementation of the WEMA 10 is shown. In FIG. 8, a wireless connection is shown between HMD 160 and WID 162. HMD 160 may have an integral wireless modulator/demodulator disposed within (not shown). More likely, however, is that HMD 160 has an adaptor 165 connectable thereto which performs these functions. WID 162 may have an integral wireless      modulator/demodulator (not shown), although an adaptor can also be used in this context.      [0105] While the device shown in FIG. 8 is described in the context of general wireless communications, various protocols may be employed. For radio frequency      communications, a variety of 802.11 protocols, 802.15 protocols, other IEEE 802 family protocols, short-range wireless transmission methods such as Bluetooth, wireless   universal serial bus protocols (W-USB), or other wireless transmission methods may be advantageously employed. Other techniques employing a similar configuration include those employing IR, microwaves, optical techniques including lasers, and so on.      [0106] It should be understood that the above is merely exemplary, and that the form of the adaptor may vary widely between HMDs and WIDs.      [0107] As noted above, besides the exercise data transmission from HMDs, other sorts of transmissions may also occur. For example, visual data, such as photographs or videos, may be transferred as an indication of the user's performance condition and to aid remote analysis. Alternatively, other visual indications of a user's status, such as graphical or other outputs of HMDs, may provide information useful for a trainer, coach, or other reviewer.      [0108] In certain embodiments, a set of visual data from a camera or from an HMD and voice communication may be transmitted via the telecommunications infrastructure from the WID. The visual data may thus be sent via an appropriate protocol to a server for retrieval and analysis by a trainer, coach or other reviewer.      [0109] The advent of multimedia mobile phones and other WIDs that include a digital camera (or are equipped with a link to one) allow the capture and transmission of photographic images using low-cost consumer devices. Embodiments of the invention may employ these in combination with HMDs.      [0110] It will be understood that the above description of a ""Method And Apparatus For Exercise Monitoring Combining Exercise Monitoring and Visual Data With Wireless Internet Connectivity "" has been with respect to particular embodiments of the invention.
