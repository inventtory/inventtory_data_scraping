Background Art    [0002]    A charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery depends on a state of charge of a sodium-sulfur battery. For example, as a state of charge of a sodium-sulfur battery gets closer to the last stage of charge, power which can be discharged by a sodium-sulfur battery is increased, and a time during which a sodium-sulfur battery can continue discharging is made longer. Then, power which can be charged into a sodium-sulfur battery is reduced, and a time during which a sodium-sulfur battery can continue being charged is made shorter.     [0003]    A charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery depends also on a temperature of a sodium-sulfur battery. A reason why a charge/discharge condition adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery depends on a temperature of a sodium-sulfur battery is that while heat generation or heat absorption occurs in a sodium-sulfur battery when a sodium-sulfur battery discharges and is charged, an upper limit of temperature which should not be violated, such as a maximum allowable temperature and a recommended operation temperature, is determined for a sodium-sulfur battery. A reason why heat generation or heat absorption occurs in a sodium-sulfur battery when a sodium-sulfur battery discharges and is charged is that a cell reaction which is an exothermic reaction proceeds in a sodium-sulfur battery when a sodium-sulfur battery discharges, a cell reaction which is an endothermic reaction proceeds in a sodium-sulfur battery when a sodium-sulfur battery is charged, and Joule heat is generated due to internal resistance in a sodium-sulfur battery when a sodium-sulfur battery discharges and is charged.     [0004]    A charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery depends also on a deterioration state of a sodium-sulfur battery. A reason why a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery depends also on a deterioration state of a sodium-sulfur battery is that internal resistance which causes Joule heat as described above varies with a deterioration state of a sodium-sulfur battery.     [0005]    In some cases, a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery depends on the other factors than a state of charge, a temperature, and a deterioration state of a sodium-sulfur battery.     [0006]    As described above, a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery depends on many factors such as a state of charge, a temperature, and a deterioration state. Thus, numerous calculations are needed in order to calculate a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery. Also a circumstance where charge power should be reduced as the last stage of charge approaches in the neighborhood of the last stage of charge when a sodium-sulfur battery is charged, or the like, is a cause of a need for numerous calculations. Charge power should be reduced as the last stage of charge approaches when a sodium-sulfur battery is charged, because internal resistance of a sodium-sulfur battery is sharply increased in the neighborhood of the last stage of charge so that it is necessary to reduce a voltage applied to a sodium-sulfur battery by reducing a current flowing in a sodium-sulfur battery in the neighborhood of the last stage of charge.     [0007]    Meanwhile, it is desired to provide an operator of a power storage device including a sodium-sulfur battery with information rendering assistance in driving the power storage device. A technique described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2008-210586 is one example thereof.     Prior Art Documents    Patent Documents    [0008]    Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2008-210586     Summary of Invention    Problems to be Solved by the Invention    [0009]    It is possible to calculate a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery by simulations, and provide an operator of the power storage device with a result of calculation with a view to providing the operator of the power storage device including a sodium-sulfur battery with information rendering assistance in driving the power storage device.     [0010]    However, since numerus calculations are needed in order to calculate a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery as described above, it is difficult to calculate a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery in real time and provide an operator of a power storage device with a result of calculation in a situation where a state of charge, a temperature, a deterioration state, and the like vary moment by moment. Thus, it is expected to calculate a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a sodium-sulfur battery by a small amount of calculations. Such circumstances hold true for a secondary battery of high-temperature operation type other than a sodium-sulfur battery.     [0011]    The present invention described below is made in order to solve the above problem. A problem which is to be solved by the present invention described below is to calculate a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a secondary battery of high-temperature operation type, by a small amount of calculations.     Means for Solving the Problems    [0012]    A device for calculating a charge/discharge condition of a secondary battery of high-temperature operation type includes a memory mechanism and a calculation mechanism.     [0013]    The memory mechanism stores a lookup table. The lookup table includes a plurality of state indicators and includes a charge/discharge condition corresponding to each of the plurality of state indicators, to thereby include a plurality of charge/discharge conditions. The plurality of charge/discharge conditions are determined so that the charge/discharge condition corresponding to each of the plurality of state indicators is adoptable in the secondary battery in a case where a state of the secondary battery is indicated by each of the plurality of state indicators. Each of the plurality of state indicators includes a value or a set of values. Each of the plurality of charge/discharge conditions includes a value or a set of values.     [0014]    A state indicator which indicates the state of the secondary battery is input to the calculation mechanism. The input state indicator includes a value or a set of values. The calculation mechanism refers to the lookup table, selects two or more state indicators which are related to the input state indicator so as to satisfy a condition, from the plurality of state indicators, extracts a charge/discharge condition corresponding to each of selected two or more state indicators from the plurality of charge/discharge conditions, to thereby extract two or more charge/discharge conditions, performs interpolation in the two or more selected state indicators and the two or more extracted charge/discharge conditions, and calculates a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in the secondary battery in a case where the state of the secondary battery is indicated by the input state indicator.     Effects of the Invention    [0015]    A charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in a secondary battery of high-temperature operation type is calculated by a small amount of calculations.     [0016]    These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Description of Embodiments    1 Power storage facility    [0018]    A block diagram of Fig. 1 shows a power storage facility and a system.     [0019]    As shown in Fig. 1 , a power storage facility 1000 includes a power storage device 1010, a control device 1011, a data logger 1012, a monitoring device 1013, and the like. The power storage device 1010 includes a sodium-sulfur battery 1020, a bidirectional converter 1021, a transformer 1022, a power line 1023, a state detection mechanism 1024, and the like. The state detection mechanism 1024 includes a temperature sensor 1030, a voltage sensor 1031, a current sensor 1032, and the like. The data logger 1012 includes a memory mechanism 1040, a calculation mechanism 1041, and the like. The memory mechanism 1040 stores a power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 and a time-prioritized resource matrix 1051. Each of the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 and the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051 is a candidate for a resource matrix which is referred to by the calculation mechanism 1041.     2 Power storage device    [0020]    The power storage device 1010 transmits power to a system 1060, and receives power from the system 1060. The sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is electrically connected to the system 1060 through the power line 1023. The bidirectional converter 1021 and the transformer 1022 are interposed on the power line 1023. The transformer 1022 is interposed between the bidirectional converter 1021 and the system 1060. The sodium-sulfur battery 1020 may be replaced with a secondary battery of high-temperature operation type other than a sodium-sulfur battery. A structure of the power storage device 1010 may be altered. For example, a power device other than the bidirectional converter 1021 and the transformer 1022 may be interposed on the power line 1023.     [0021]    When the power storage device 1010 transmits power to the system 1060, the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 discharges, and discharged power is transmitted from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 to the system 1060 through the power line 1023. The discharged power is converted from a direct current to an alternating current by the bidirectional converter 1021, and is boosted by the transformer 1022.     [0022]    When the power storage device 1010 receives power from the system 1060, received power is transmitted from the system 1060 to the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 through the power line 1023, and the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is charged with the received power. The received power is stepped down by the transformer 1022, and is converted from an alternating current to a direct current by the bidirectional converter 1021.     [0023]    The state detection mechanism 1024 repeatedly detects a state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020, and repeatedly inputs an indicator of a state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 to the control device 1011. In a case where the state detection mechanism 1024 includes the temperature sensor 1030, the voltage sensor 1031, and the a current sensor 1032, the temperature sensor 1030 senses a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 and inputs a temperature value of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 to the control device 1011, the voltage sensor 1031 senses a voltage of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 and inputs a voltage value of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 to the control device 1011, and the current sensor 1032 senses a current flowing in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 and inputs a value of current flowing in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020, to the control device 1011, so that a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011 includes a set of a temperature value, a voltage value, and a current value.     [0024]    A state indicator which is input to the control device 1011 may be changed to a value or a set of values other than a set of a temperature value, a voltage value, and a current value. For example, a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011 may be changed to a set of a temperature value, a voltage value, and a power value. In a case where a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011 is changed to a value or a set of values other than a set of a temperature value, a voltage value, and a current value, a structure of the state detection mechanism 1024 is altered. For example, in a case where a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011 is changed to a set of a temperature value, a voltage value, and a power value, the current sensor 1032 is replaced with a power sensor. A power sensor senses power which is discharged by the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 and power which is charged into the sodium-sulfur battery 1020, and inputs a value of power which is discharged by the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 and power which is charged into the sodium-sulfur battery 1020, to the control device 1011.     [0025]    The power storage device 1010 may perform a load leveling operation or a load following operation. The power storage device 1010 may be used as a countermeasure for power failure or instantaneous voltage drop.     3 Control device    [0026]    The control device 1011 repeatedly calculates a secondary state indicator of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 from an input primary state indicator of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020, and repeatedly inputs a calculated state indicator to the calculation mechanism 1041. A state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 includes a set of a temperature value and a state-of-charge value (SOC value), and is used for calculating a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020. A temperature value included in a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 agrees with a temperature value included in a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011. A temperature value included in a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 may be a value obtained by making a correction or the like to a temperature value included in a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011. An SOC value included in a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 is calculated from histories of a voltage value and a current value which are included in a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011.     [0027]    A state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 may be changed to a value or a set of values which indicates a state of a secondary battery, other than a set of a temperature value and an SOC value. For example, in a case where a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 is used for calculating a charge condition which is adoptable in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020, a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 may be changed to an SOC value. A reason for it is that since a cell reaction caused when the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is charged is an endothermic reaction, there can occur a situation where it is unnecessary to consider that a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 rises to be higher than an upper limit of temperature in calculating a charge condition of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020. Also, a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 may be changed to a set of temperature value, an SOC value, and the number of equivalent cycles. The number of equivalent cycles is the number of charge/discharge cycles required for reproducing a deterioration state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 when the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is caused to discharge in capacity equal to rated capacity of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in each of a charge/discharge cycles, and the number of equivalent cycles is calculated from histories of a voltage value and a current value which are included in a state indicator input to the control device 1011. The number of equivalent cycles may be replaced with a deterioration state value of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 other than the number of equivalent cycles. For example, the number of equivalent cycles may be replaced with an indicator value of internal resistance of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020. An indicator value of internal resistance is calculated from a voltage value and a current value included in a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011 when the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 discharges or is charged under a specific condition. For example, an indicator value of internal resistance is calculated from a voltage value and a current value included in a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011 when the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 discharges certain power for a certain time period since the last stage of discharge. An indicator value of internal resistance may be calculated from a voltage value and a current value included in a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011 when the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 accidentally discharges or is charged under a specific condition, or may be calculated from a voltage value and a current value included in a state indicator which is input to the control device 1011 when the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is forced to discharge or be charged under a specific condition.     4 Data logger    [0028]    The data logger 1012 is a device for recording a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041.     [0029]    The data logger 1012 also serves as a device for calculating a power-prioritized output matrix and a time-prioritized output matrix. The data logger 1012 refers to the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 or the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051, calculates in real time, a power-prioritized output matrix and a time-prioritized output matrix which correspond to a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041, and inputs the calculated power-prioritized output matrix and the calculated time-prioritized output matrix to the monitoring device 1013.     [0030]    Each of a power-prioritized output matrix and a time-prioritized output matrix includes a charge/discharge condition which is adoptable in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020. A charge/discharge condition includes a plurality of sets each including a charge/discharge power value and a charge/discharge time value, and indicates a charge/discharge allowable range of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020. A charge/discharge condition may include one set of a charge/discharge power value and a charge/discharge time value.     [0031]    A device for calculating a power-prioritized output matrix and a time-prioritized output matrix may be provided independently of the data logger 1012.     [0032]    The data logger 1012 may be a device with a low calculation capability, such as a programmable logic controller (PLC) and a personal computer (PC) for a logger. The memory mechanism 1040 is constituted by a memory and the like, and the calculation mechanism 1041 is constituted by a microprocessor and the like. A whole or a part of functions of the data logger 1012 may be fulfilled by a hardware which does not execute any program.     5 Monitoring device    [0033]    The monitoring device 1013 displays a power-prioritized output matrix and a time-prioritized output matrix which are input, on a display device. An operator refers to both or either of a power-prioritized output matrix and a time-prioritized output matrix which are displayed by the monitoring device 1013, and sets a charge/discharge condition of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020. A power-prioritized output matrix and a time-prioritized output matrix which are input may be provided to an operator in the other way than by being displayed on the display device. For example, a power-prioritized output matrix and a time-prioritized output matrix which are input may be printed out.     6 Power-prioritized resource matrix    6.1 Basic structure    [0034]    A schematic view of Fig. 2 shows a power-prioritized resource matrix.     [0035]    As shown in Fig. 2 , the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 is a lookup table, includes pxq state indicators 1100 when the number of temperature values is p and the number of SOC values is q, and includes a charge/discharge condition corresponding to each of the pxq state indicators 1100, to thereby include pxq charge/discharge conditions 1101, and further include a post-charge/discharge state indicator corresponding to each of the pxq state indicators 1100, to thereby include pxq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1102. As a result of this, in a case where a state indicator is selected from the pq state indicators 1100, a charge/discharge condition corresponding to the selected state indicator can be extracted from the pq charge/discharge conditions 1101, and a post-charge/discharge state indicator corresponding to the selected state indicator can be extracted from the pq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1102.     [0036]    The pq charge/discharge conditions 1101 are previously determined by simulations, experiments, or the like so that a charge/discharge condition corresponding to each of the pq state indicators 1100 can be adopted in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in a case where a state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by each of the pq state indicators 1100.     [0037]    The pq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1102 are previously determined by simulations, experiments, or the like so that a post-charge/discharge state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 can be indicated by a post-charge/discharge state indicator corresponding to each of the pq state indicators 1100 in a case where a state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by each of the pXq state indicators 1100 and the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 discharges or is charged under a charge/discharge condition corresponding to each of the pq state indicators 1100.     [0038]    The power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 includes a charge/discharge identifier corresponding to each of the pXq charge/discharge conditions 1101, to thereby include pq charge/discharge identifiers 1103. As a result of this, a charge/discharge identifier corresponding to an extracted charge/discharge condition can be extracted from the pq charge/discharge identifiers 1103.     [0039]    A correspondence between a certain composing element included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 and a different composing element included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 is indicated by a fact that a value or a group of values included in the certain composing element belongs to the same row or the same column as a value or a group of values included in the different composing element. Specific examples thereof will be later provided.     [0040]    The number of state indicators pq which is a product of the number of temperature values p and the number of SOC values q is a natural number not smaller than two. A structure of the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, the number of temperature values p, the number of SOC values q, and the number of state indicators pq are changed in accordance with specifications of the data logger 1012.     6.2 State indicator    [0041]    Each of the pq state indicators 1100 includes one set of a temperature value and an SOC value. The pq state indicators 1100 are discrete. The pq state indicators 1100 are arranged in a column direction.     [0042]    The power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 includes p-1 temperature values of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"", and one temperature value of ""COMMON"", to thereby include p temperature values. A temperature value of ""COMMON"" means an arbitrary temperature value. The power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 includes q SOC values of ""100%"", ""95%"", ..., and ""0%"", for each of the p temperature values. As a result of this, pq sets each of which includes a temperature value and an SOC value are formed, so that the pXq state indicators 1100 are formed.     [0043]    The p temperature values are indexes for high-speed search. With a view to using the p temperature values as indexes for high-speed search, arrangement of the p-1 temperature values of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"" in a column direction in an ascending order is followed by a single temperature value of ""COMMON"" being arranged in a column direction, and a distance between two adjacent temperature values in the p-1 temperature values of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"" is set at a constant value of ""1"". As a result of this, a specific temperature value can be searched for by a small amount of calculations. The p-1 temperature values may be arranged in a descending order.     [0044]    The q SOC values are indexes for high-speed search. With a view to using the q SOC values as indexes for high-speed search, the q SOC values are arranged in a column direction in a descending order, and a distance between two adjacent SOC values in the q SOC values is set at a constant value of ""5"". As a result of this, a specific SOC value can be searched for by a small amount of calculations. The q SOC values may be arranged in an ascending order.     [0045]    The pq state indicators 1100 are indexes for high-speed search. With a view to using the pq state indicators 1100 as indexes for high-speed search, it is designed such that a specific temperature value and a specific SOC can be searched for by a small amount of calculations.     [0046]    A state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 can be compared with each of the pq state indicators 1100 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050. Since a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 can be compared with each of the pq state indicators 1100 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, a state indicator which agrees with, or is close to, a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 can be selected from the pXq state indicators 1100 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050. In order to allow a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 to be compared with each of the pq state indicators 1100 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, in a case where a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 is changed to a value or a set of values other than a set of a temperature value and an SOC value, also each of the pq state indicators 1100 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 is changed to a value or a set of values other than a set of a temperature value and an SOC value. For example, in a case where a state indicator which is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 is changed to a set of a temperature value, an SOC value, and the number of equivalent cycles, also each of the pq state indicators 1100 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 is changed to a set of a temperature value, an SOC value, and the number of equivalent cycles.     6.3 Charge/discharge condition    [0047]    Each of the pXq charge/discharge conditions 1101 includes r sets each of which includes a charge/discharge power value and a charge/discharge time value. The pq charge/discharge conditions 1101 are discrete.     [0048]    Each of the pq charge/discharge conditions 1101 includes r charge/discharge power values of ""100%"", ""97.5%"", ..., and ""0.5%"" and includes a charge/discharge time value corresponding to each of the r charge/discharge power values, to thereby include r charge/discharge time values. As a result of this, r sets each of which includes a charge/discharge power value and a charge/discharge time value are formed.     [0049]    The r charge/discharge time values are previously determined by simulations, experiments, or the like so that the longest time during which the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 can continue being charged or discharging is indicated by a charge/discharge time value corresponding to each of the r charge/discharge power values in a case where a charge/discharge power value of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by each of the r charge/discharge power values.     [0050]    The r charge/discharge power values are indexes for high-speed search. With a view to using the r charge/discharge power values as indexes for high-speed search, the r charge/discharge power values are arranged in a row direction in a descending order, and a distance between two adjacent charge/discharge power values in the r charge/discharge power values except a lower end value of ""0.5%"", is set at a constant value of ""2.5%"". As a result of this, a specific charge/discharge power value can be searched for by a small amount of calculations. The r charge/discharge power values may be arranged in an ascending order.     [0051]    Each of the r charge/discharge power values is represented by a ratio thereof to a maximum charge/discharge power value of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020. Each of the r charge/discharge power values may be represented in a different manner.     [0052]    A correspondence between a charge/discharge condition and a state indicator is indicated by a fact that the r charge/discharge time values which are included in the charge/discharge condition are arranged in a row direction belong to the same row as an SOC value included in the state indicator. A correspondence between a charge/discharge time value and a charge/discharge power value is indicated by a fact that the charge/discharge time value belongs to the same column as the charge/discharge power value.     [0053]    Each of the pq charge/discharge conditions 1101 may be changed to a value or a set of values other than a set of a charge/discharge power value and a charge/discharge time value. For example, each of the pq charge/discharge conditions 1101 may be changed to a set of a charge/discharge current value and a charge/discharge time value.     [0054]    The number of charge/discharge power values r is a natural number not smaller than two. The number of charge/discharge time values r is changed in accordance with specifications of the data logger 1012.     6.4 Charge/discharge identifier    [0055]    A charge/discharge identifier indicates which of a discharge condition and a charge condition is a charge/discharge condition corresponding to the charge/discharge identifier. A charge/discharge identifier of ""D"" indicates that a charge/discharge condition corresponding to the charge/discharge identifier of ""D"" is a discharge condition. A charge/discharge identifier of ""C"" indicates that a charge/discharge condition corresponding to the charge/discharge identifier of ""C"" is a charge condition.     [0056]    A correspondence between a charge/discharge identifier and a charge/discharge condition is indicated by a fact that the charge/discharge identifier belongs to the same row as the r charge/discharge time values included in the charge/discharge condition.     [0057]    A charge/discharge condition corresponding to a state indicator which includes a temperature value of any of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"" corresponds to a charge/discharge identifier of ""D"". A charge/discharge condition corresponding to a state indicator which includes a temperature value of ""COMMON"" corresponds to a charge/discharge identifier of ""C"".     6.5 Post-charge/discharge state indicator    [0058]    Each of the pq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1102 includes r sets each including a post-charge/discharge temperature value and a post-charge/discharge SOC value.     [0059]    Each of the pq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1102 includes a post-charge/discharge temperature value corresponding to each of the r charge/discharge power values of ""100%"", ""97.5%"", ..., and ""0.5%"", to thereby include r post-charge/discharge temperature values, and includes a post-charge/discharge SOC value corresponding to each of the r charge/discharge power values of ""100%"", ""97.5%"", ..., and ""0.5%"", to thereby include r post-charge/discharge SOC values. As a result of this, r sets each of which includes a post-charge/discharge temperature value and a post-charge/discharge SOC value are formed.     [0060]    The r post-charge/discharge temperature values are previously determined by simulations, experiments, or the like so that a post-charge/discharge temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by a post-charge/discharge temperature value corresponding to each of the r charge/discharge power values in a case where charge/discharge power of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by each of the r charge/discharge power values. The r post-charge/discharge SOC values are previously determined by simulations, experiments, or the like so that a post-charge/discharge SOC of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by a SOC values corresponding to each of the r charge/discharge power values in a case where charge/discharge power of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by each of the r charge/discharge power values.     [0061]    A correspondence between a post-charge/discharge temperature value and a charge/discharge power value is indicated by a fact that the post-charge/discharge temperature value belongs to the same column as the charge/discharge power value. A correspondence between a post-charge/discharge SOC value and a charge/discharge power value is indicated by a fact that the post-charge/discharge SOC value belongs to the same column as the charge/discharge power value.     [0062]    A set of a post-charge/discharge temperature value and a post-charge/discharge SOC value, which is included in each of the pq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1102 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 may be changed to a value or a set of values other than a set of a post-charge/discharge temperature value and a post-charge/discharge SOC value.     7 Time-prioritized resource matrix    [0063]    A schematic view of Fig. 3 shows a time-prioritized resource matrix. The following description will deal with a time-prioritized resource matrix while focusing on differences from the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050.     [0064]    As shown in Fig. 3 , the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051 is a lookup table, includes pq state indicators 1110, includes a charge/discharge conditions corresponding to each of the pq state indicators 1110, to thereby include pq charge/discharge conditions 1111, and includes a post-charge/discharge state indicator corresponding to each of the pq state indicators 1110, to thereby include pq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1112. In this respect, the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051 is similar to the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050.     [0065]    In the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, the q SOC values are arranged in a column direction. In contrast thereto, in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051, the q SOC values are arranged in a row direction.     [0066]    In the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, each of the pq charge/discharge conditions 1101 includes the r charge/discharge power values of ""100%"", ""97.5%"", ..., and ""0.5%"", and includes a charge/discharge time value corresponding to each of the r charge/discharge power values, to thereby include the r charge/discharge time values. The r charge/discharge time values are determined so that the longest time during which the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 can continue being charged or discharging can be indicated by a charge/discharge time value corresponding to each of the r charge/discharge power values in a case where charge/discharge power of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by each of the r charge/discharge power values. In contrast thereto, in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051, each of the pq charge/discharge conditions 1111 includes s charge/discharge time values of ""15"", ""30"", ..., and ""2880"", and includes a charge/discharge power value corresponding to each of the s charge/discharge time values, to thereby include s charge/discharge power values. The s charge/discharge power values are determined so that maximum power which can be charged into, or can be discharged by, the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 can be indicated by a charge/discharge power value corresponding to each of the s charge/discharge time values in a case where a charge/discharge time of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by each of the s charge/discharge time values.     [0067]    In the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, the r charge/discharge power values of ""100%"", ""97.5%"", ..., and ""0.5%"" are used as indexes and are arranged in a row direction in a descending order, and a distance between two adjacent charge/discharge power values in the r charge/discharge power values except a lower end value of ""0.5%"" is set at a constant value of ""2.5%"". In contrast thereto, in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051, the s charge/discharge time values of ""15"", ""30"", ..., and ""2880"" are used as indexes and are arranged in a column direction in an ascending order, and a distance between two adjacent charge/discharge time values in the s charge/discharge time values is set at a constant value of ""15"".     [0068]    The power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 includes a charge/discharge identifier corresponding to each of the pq charge/discharge conditions 1101. In contrast thereto, the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051 includes a charge/discharge identifier corresponding to each of s sets each including a charge/discharge time value and a charge/discharge time value, which are included in each of the pq charge/discharge conditions 1111, to thereby include pxs charge/discharge identifiers 1113.     8 Calculation mechanism    8.1 Flow of processes    [0069]    A flow chart of Fig. 4 shows a flow of processes performed by a calculation mechanism. Each of schematic views of Figs 5 to 8 shows a temporary matrix generated in the course of the processes. A schematic view of Fig. 9 shows a power-prioritized output matrix. A schematic view of Fig. 10 shows a time-prioritized output matrix.     [0070]    The calculation mechanism 1041 receives an input of a state indicator which indicates a state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in a step 1121 in Fig. 4 , outputs a power-prioritized output matrix by referring to the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 in steps 1122 to 1128 in Fig. 4 , and outputs a time-prioritized output matrix by referring to the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051 in steps 1129 to 1135 in Fig. 4 . An input state indicator includes a set of a temperature value Temp_i and an SOC value SOC_i.     [0071]    The calculation mechanism 1041 may output only one of a power-prioritized output matrix and a time-prioritized output matrix which is selected. The memory mechanism 1040 may store only the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, and the calculation mechanism 1041 may output only a power-prioritized output matrix. The memory mechanism 1040 may store only the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051, and the calculation mechanism 1041 may output only a time-prioritized output matrix.     8.2 Calculation of power-prioritized output matrix    [0072]    The calculation mechanism 1041 refers to the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 in the step 1122 in Fig. 4 .     [0073]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1123 in Fig. 4 , selects two temperature values Tempj and Temp_k other than a temperature value of ""COMMON"", and selects a temperature value of ""COMMON"", from the p temperature values included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050.     [0074]    The two selected temperature values Tempj and Temp_k are adjacent to each other in the p-1 temperature values of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"" which are included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050. The selected temperature value Tempj is lower than an input temperature value Temp_i. The selected temperature value Temp_k is higher than an input temperature value Temp_i. If any of the p-1 temperature values of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"" which are included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 agrees with an input temperature value Temp_i, the calculation mechanism 1041 selects one temperature value Temp_i other than a temperature value of ""COMMON"", and selects a temperature value of ""COMMON"", from the p temperature values included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050.     [0075]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1124 in Fig. 4 , selects two SOC values SOC_j and SOC_k from the q SOC values included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, for each of the two selected temperature values Tempj and Temp_k other than a temperature value of ""COMMON"", and the selected temperature value of ""COMMON"".     [0076]    The two selected SOC values SOC_j and SOC_k are adjacent to each other in the q SOC values which are included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050. A selected SOC value SOC_j is lower than an input SOC value SOC_i. The selected SOC value SOC_k is higher than an input SOC value SOC_i. If any of the q SOC values included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 agrees with an SOC value SOC_i, the calculation mechanism 1041 selects an SOC value SOC_i from the q SOC values included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050.     [0077]    By the steps 1123 and 1124 shown in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 5 , four sets each including a temperature value of any of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"" and an SOC value are selected from the pq sets each including a temperature value and an SOC value which are included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050. More specifically, four state indicators 1150 each of which includes a temperature value of any of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"" are selected from the pq state indicators included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050. The four state indicators 1150 are selected to be related to an input state indicator 1154 so as to satisfy a condition for allowing interpolation. In order to allow interpolation, two or more state indicators should be selected.     [0078]    Further, by the steps 1123 and 1124 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 6 , two sets each including a temperature value of ""COMMON"" and an SOC value are selected from the pq sets each including a temperature value and an SOC value which are included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050. More specifically, two state indicators 1160 each of which includes a temperature value of ""COMMON"" are selected from the pq state indicators included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050. The two state indicators 1160 are selected to be related to an input state indicator 1164 so as to satisfy a condition for allowing interpolation. In order to allow interpolation, two or more state indicators should be selected.     [0079]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1125 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 5 , extracts an indicator of charge/discharge condition corresponding to each of the four selected state indicators 1150, from the pq charge/discharge conditions 1101 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, to thereby extract four charge/discharge conditions 1151, and extracts a post-charge/discharge state indicator corresponding to each of the four selected state indicators 1150 from the pq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1102 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, to thereby extract four post-charge/discharge state indicators 1152.     [0080]    Further, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1125 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 6 , extracts a charge/discharge condition corresponding to each of the two selected state indicators 1160 from the pq charge/discharge conditions 1101 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, to thereby extract two charge/discharge conditions 1161, and extracts a post-charge/discharge state indicator corresponding to each of the two selected state indicators 1160 from the pq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1102 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, to thereby extract two post-charge/discharge state indicators 1162.     [0081]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1126 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 5 , extracts a charge/discharge identifier of ""D"" corresponding to each of the four extracted charge/discharge conditions 1151 from the pq charge/discharge identifiers 1103 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, to thereby extract four charge/discharge identifiers 1153. As a result of this, it is determined that each of the four extracted charge/discharge conditions 1151 is a discharge condition.     [0082]    Further, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1126 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 6 , a charge/discharge identifier of ""C"" corresponding to each of the two extracted charge/discharge conditions 1161 from the pq charge/discharge identifiers 1103 included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, to thereby extract two charge/discharge identifiers 1163. As a result of this, it is determined that each of the two extracted charge/discharge conditions 1161 is a charge condition.     [0083]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1127 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 5 , performs linear interpolation in the four selected state indicators 1150 and the four extracted charge/discharge conditions (discharge conditions) 1151, calculates a power-prioritized charge/discharge condition (discharge condition) 1155 corresponding to the input state indicator 1154, performs linear interpolation in the four selected state indicators 1150 and the four extracted post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicators 1152, and calculates a post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicator 1156 corresponding to the input state indicator 1154. As a result of this, the power-prioritized charge/discharge condition (discharge condition) 1155 which is adoptable in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in a case where a state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by the input state indicator 1154, is calculated, and the post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicator 1156 which indicates a post-charge/discharge state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in a state where a state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by the input state indicator 1154 and the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 discharges or is charged under the power-prioritized charge/discharge condition (discharge condition) 1155, is calculated. Interpolation in the other way than linear interpolation may be performed.     [0084]    In each of a case where one temperature value is selected from the p-1 temperature values of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"" which are included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 and two SOC values are selected from the q SOC values included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, and a case where two temperature values are selected from the p-1 temperature values of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"" included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 and one SOC value is selected from the q SOC values included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, two state indicators are selected in place of the four state indicators 1150, two charge/discharge conditions (discharge conditions) are extracted in place of the four charge/discharge conditions (discharge conditions ) 1151, and two post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicators are extracted in place of the four post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicators 1152. In this case, linear interpolation is performed in the two selected state indicators and the two extracted charge/discharge conditions (discharge conditions), a power-prioritized charge/discharge condition (discharge condition) corresponding to the input state indicator 1154 is calculated, linear interpolation is performed in the two selected state indicators and the two extracted post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicators, and a post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicator corresponding to the input state indicator is calculated.     [0085]    In a case where one temperature value is selected from the p-1 temperature values of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"" included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050 and one SOC value is selected from the q SOC values included in the power-prioritized resource matrix 1050, one state indicator is selected in place of the four state indicators 1150, one charge/discharge condition (discharge conditions) is extracted in place of the four charge/discharge conditions 1151, and one post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicator is extracted in place of the four post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicators 1152. In this case, linear interpolation is not performed exceptionally, and the extracted charge/discharge condition (discharge condition) and the extracted post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicator are respectively used as a power-prioritized charge/discharge condition (discharge condition) and a post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicator which correspond to the input state indicator 1154.     [0086]    Further, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1127 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 6 , performs interpolation in the two selected state indicators 1160 and the two extracted charge/discharge conditions (charge conditions) 1161, calculates a power-prioritized charge/discharge condition (charge condition) 1165 corresponding to the input state indicator 1164, performs interpolation in the two selected state indicators 1160 and the two extracted post-charge/discharge (post-charge) state indicators 1162, and calculates a post-charge/discharge (post-charge) state indicator 1166 corresponding to the input state indicator 1164. As a result of this, the power-prioritized charge/discharge condition (charge condition) 1165 which is adoptable in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in a case where a state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by the input state indicator 1164 is calculated, and the post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicator 1166 which indicates a post-charge/discharge state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in a case where a state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by the input state indicator 1164 and the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 discharges or is charged under the power-prioritized charge/discharge condition (discharge condition) 1165, is calculated. Interpolation in the other way than linear interpolation may be performed.     [0087]    In a case where one SOC value is selected from the q SOC values, one state indicator is selected in place of the two state indicators 1160, one charge/discharge condition (charge condition) is extracted in place of the two charge/discharge conditions (charge conditions) 1161, and one post-charge/discharge (post-charge) state indicator is extracted in place of the two post-charge/discharge (post-charge) state indicators 1162. In this case, linear interpolation is not performed exceptionally, and the extracted charge/discharge condition (charge condition) and the extracted post-charge/discharge (post-charge) state indicator are respectively used as a power-prioritized charge/discharge condition (charge condition) and a post-charge/discharge (post-charge) state indicator which correspond to the input state indicator 1164.     [0088]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1128 in Fig. 4 , calculates a power-prioritized output matrix 1190 shown in Fig. 9 , and inputs the power-prioritized output matrix 1190 to the monitoring device 1013.     [0089]    As shown in Fig. 9 , the power-prioritized output matrix 1190 is a table, and includes a discharge condition portion 1200 and a charge condition portion 1201. In the power-prioritized output matrix 1190, a rule which states that a discharge power value is represented by a positive number, and a charge power value is represented by a negative number, is used. Such a rule may be changed.     [0090]    The discharge condition portion 1200 includes ten charge/discharge power values 1210 of ""100%"", ""95%"", ..., and ""5%"", includes a charge/discharge time value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge power values 1210, to thereby include ten charge/discharge time values 1211, includes an increment of SOC value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge power values 1210, to thereby include ten increments of SOC values 1212, and includes a post-charge/discharge SOC value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge power values 1210, to thereby include ten post-charge/discharge SOC values 1213. The ten charge/discharge power values 1210 and the ten charge/discharge time values 1211 are respectively extracted from the r charge/discharge power values and the r charge/discharge time values which are included in the calculated charge/discharge condition 1155. The ten increments of SOC values 1212 are calculated from an SOC value included in the input state indicator 1154 and the r post-charge/discharge SOC values included in the calculated post-charge/discharge state indicator 1156. The ten post-charge/discharge SOC values 1213 are extracted from the r post-charge/discharge SOC values included in the calculated post-charge/discharge state indicator 1156.     [0091]    The charge condition portion 1201 includes ten charge/discharge power values 1220 of ""-5%"", ""-10%"", ..., and ""-100%"", includes a charge/discharge time value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge power values 1220, to thereby include ten charge/discharge time values 1221, includes an increment of SOC value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge power values 1220, to thereby include ten increments of SOC values 1222, and includes a post-charge/discharge SOC value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge power values 1220, to thereby include ten post-charge/discharge SOC values 1223. The ten charge/discharge power values 1220 and the ten charge/discharge time values 1221 are respectively extracted from the r charge/discharge power values and the r charge/discharge time values which are included in the extracted charge/discharge condition 1165. The ten increments of SOC values 1222 are calculated from an SOC value included in the input state indicator 1164 and the r post-charge/discharge SOC values included in the calculated post-charge/discharge state indicator 1166. The ten post-charge/discharge SOC values 1213 are extracted from the r post-charge/discharge SOC values included in the calculated post-charge/discharge state indicator 1166.     8.3 Calculation of time-prioritized output matrix    [0092]    The following description will deal with calculation of a time-prioritized output matrix while focusing on differences from calculation of the power-prioritized output matrix 1190.     [0093]    The calculation mechanism 1041 refers to the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051 in a step 1129 in Fig. 4 .     [0094]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1130 in Fig. 4 , selects two temperature values Tempj and Temp_k other than a temperature value of ""COMMON"", and selects a temperature value of ""COMMON"", from the p temperature values included in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051.     [0095]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1131 in Fig. 4 , selects two SOC values SOC_j and SOC_k from the q SOC values included in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051, for each of the two selected temperature values Tempj and Temp_k other than a temperature value of ""COMMON"", and the selected temperature value of ""COMMON"".     [0096]    By the steps 1130 and 1131 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 7 , four state indicators 1170 each of which includes a temperature value of any of ""305"", ""306"", ..., and ""339"", are selected from the pq state indicators included in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051.     [0097]    Further, by the steps 1130 and 1131 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 8 , two state indicators 1180 each of which includes a temperature value of ""COMMON"", are selected from the pq state indicators included in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051.     [0098]    Further, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1132 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 7 , extracts a charge/discharge condition corresponding to each of the four selected state indicators 1170 from the pq charge/discharge conditions 1111 included in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051, to thereby extract four charge/discharge conditions 1171, and extracts a post-charge/discharge state indicator corresponding to each of the four selected state indicators 1170 from the pq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1112 included in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051, to thereby extract four post-charge/discharge state indicators 1172.     [0099]    Further, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1132 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 8 , extracts a charge/discharge condition corresponding to each of the two selected state indicators 1180 from the pq charge/discharge conditions 1111 included in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051, to thereby extract two charge/discharge conditions 1181, and extracts a post-charge/discharge state indicator corresponding to each of the two selected state indicators 1180 from the pq post-charge/discharge state indicators 1112 included in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051, to thereby extract two post-charge/discharge state indicators 1182.     [0100]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1133 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 7 , extracts a charge/discharge identifier of ""D"" corresponding to each of the s sets each including a charge/discharge time value and a charge/discharge power value which are included in each of the four extracted charge/discharge conditions 1171, from the ps charge/discharge identifiers 1113 included in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051. As a result of this, it is determined that each of the four extracted charge/discharge conditions 1171 is a discharge condition.     [0101]    Further, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1133 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 8 , extracts a charge/discharge identifier of ""C"" corresponding to each of the s sets each including a charge/discharge time value and a charge/discharge power value which are included in each of the two extracted charge/discharge conditions 1181, from the ps charge/discharge identifiers 1113 included in the time-prioritized resource matrix 1051. As a result of this, it is determined that each of the two extracted charge/discharge conditions 1181 is a charge condition.     [0102]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1134 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 7 , performs linear interpolation in the four selected state indicators 1170 and the four extracted charge/discharge conditions (discharge conditions) 1171, calculates a time-prioritized charge/discharge condition (discharge condition) 1175 corresponding to an input state indicator 1174, performs linear interpolation in the four selected state indicators 1170 and the four extracted post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicators 1172, and calculates a post-charge/discharge (post-discharge) state indicator 1176 corresponding to the input state indicator 1174.     [0103]    Further, the calculation mechanism 1041, in the step 1134 in Fig. 4 , as shown in Fig. 8 , performs interpolation in the two selected state indicators 1180 and the two extracted charge/discharge conditions (charge conditions) 1181, calculates a time-prioritized charge/discharge condition (charge condition) 1185 corresponding to an input state indicator 1184, performs interpolation in the two selected state indicators 1180 and the two extracted post-charge/discharge (post-charge) state indicators 1182, and calculates a post-charge/discharge (post-charge) state indicator 1186 corresponding to the input state indicator 1184.     [0104]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1135 in Fig. 4 , calculates a time-prioritized output matrix 1230, and inputs the time-prioritized output matrix 1230 to the monitoring device 1013.     [0105]    As shown in Fig. 10 , the time-prioritized output matrix 1230 is a table, and includes a discharge condition portion 1240 and a charge condition portion 1241.     [0106]    The discharge condition portion 1240 includes ten charge/discharge time values 1250 of ""15"", ""30"", ..., and ""2880"", includes a charge/discharge power value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge time values 1250, to thereby include ten charge/discharge power values 1251, includes a increment of SOC value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge time values 1250, to thereby include ten increments of SOC values 1252, and includes a post-charge/discharge SOC value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge time values 1250, to thereby include ten post-charge/discharge SOC values 1253. The ten charge/discharge time values 1250 and the ten charge/discharge power values 1251 are respectively extracted from the s charge/discharge time values and the s charge/discharge power values which are included in the calculated charge/discharge condition 1175. The ten increments of SOC values 1252 can be calculated from an SOC value included in the input state indicator 1174 and the s post-charge/discharge SOC values included in the calculated post-charge/discharge state indicator 1176. The ten post-charge/discharge SOC values 1253 are extracted from the s post-charge/discharge SOC values included in the calculated post-charge/discharge state indicator 1176.     [0107]    The charge condition portion 1241 includes ten charge/discharge time values 1260 of ""15"", ""30"", ..., and ""2880"", includes a charge/discharge power value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge time values 1260, to thereby include ten charge/discharge power values 1261, includes a increment of SOC value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge time values 1260, to thereby include ten increments of SOC values 1262, and includes a post-charge/discharge SOC value corresponding to each of the ten charge/discharge time values 1260, to thereby include ten post-charge/discharge SOC values 1263. The ten charge/discharge time values 1260 and the ten charge/discharge power values 1261 are respectively extracted from the s charge/discharge time values and the s charge/discharge power values which are included in the calculated charge/discharge condition 1185. The ten increments of SOC values 1262 can be calculated from an SOC value included in the input state indicator 1184 and the s post-charge/discharge SOC values included in the calculated post-charge/discharge state indicator 1186. The ten post-charge/discharge SOC values 1263 are extracted from the s post-charge/discharge SOC values included in the calculated post-charge/discharge state indicator 1186.     [0108]    In calculation of such the power-prioritized output matrix 1190 and the time-prioritized output matrix 1230 as described above, the charge/discharge conditions 1101 and 1111 which are previously determined are utilized, so that an amount of calculations can be reduced.     9 Output of power-prioritized output matrix which reflects the number of equivalent cycles    [0109]    An embodiment in which a calculation mechanism calculates a power-prioritized output matrix which reflects the number of equivalent cycles will be described below.     [0110]    A schematic view of Fig. 11 shows data stored in a memory mechanism in a case where a calculation mechanism calculates a power-prioritized output matrix which reflects the number of equivalent cycles. A flow chart of Fig. 12 shows a flow of processes performed by a calculation mechanism in a case where a calculation mechanism calculates a power-prioritized output matrix which reflects the number of equivalent cycles.     [0111]    According to the present embodiment, as shown in Fig. 11 , the memory mechanism 1040 stores a plurality of numbers of equivalent cycles 1300, and stores a power-prioritized resource matrix corresponding to each of the plurality of numbers of equivalent cycles 1300, to thereby store a plurality of power-prioritized resource matrices 1301.     [0112]    The plurality of power-prioritized resource matrices 1301 are previously determined by simulations, experiments, or the like so that a power-prioritized charge/discharge condition can be calculated by using a power-prioritized resource matrix corresponding to each of the plurality of numbers of equivalent cycles 1300 as a resource matrix to be referred in a case where the number of equivalent cycles of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by each of the plurality of numbers of equivalent cycles 1300.     [0113]    Each of the plurality of power-prioritized resource matrices 1301 is a candidate for a resource matrix to be referred.     [0114]    According to the present embodiment, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1311 in Fig. 12 , receives an input of the number of equivalent cycles.     [0115]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1312 in Fig. 12 , selects the number of equivalent cycles which is the closest to the input number of equivalent cycles, from the plurality of numbers of equivalent cycles 1300 stored in the memory mechanism 1040. The selected number of equivalent cycles may be changed. For example, the number of equivalent cycles which is the closest to the input number of equivalent cycles among the numbers of equivalent cycles which are larger than the input number of equivalent cycles may be selected, or the number of equivalent cycles which is the closest to the input number of equivalent cycles among the numbers of equivalent cycles which are smaller than the input number of equivalent cycles may be selected. More generally, the number of equivalent cycles which is related to the input number of equivalent cycles so as to satisfy a condition is selected.     [0116]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1313 in Fig. 12 , extracts a power-prioritized resource matrix corresponding to the selected number of equivalent cycles from the plurality of power-prioritized resource matrices 1301 stored in the memory mechanism 1040.     [0117]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1314 in Fig. 12 , calculates a power-prioritized output matrix in such a manner as shown in the steps 1121 to 1128 in Fig. 4 by using the extracted power-prioritized resource matrix as a resource matrix to be referred, to thereby calculate a power-prioritized output matrix corresponding to the input number of equivalent cycles. As a result of this, a power-prioritized output matrix which is adoptable in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in a case where a deterioration state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by the input number of equivalent cycles is calculated.     [0118]    In place of a power-prioritized output matrix, or in addition to a power-prioritized output matrix, similar calculations may be performed with respect to a time-prioritized output matrix.     [0119]    The number of equivalent cycles may be replaced with a deterioration state value which indicates a deterioration state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020, other than the number of equivalent cycles. For example, the number of equivalent cycles may be replaced with an indicator value of internal resistance.     [0120]    A flow chart of Fig. 13 shows a flow of processes performed by a calculation mechanism in a case where the calculation mechanism calculates a power-prioritized output matrix which reflects the number of equivalent cycles. Processes shown in Fig. 13 can be employed in place of the processes shown in Fig. 12 .     [0121]    According to the present embodiment, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1321 in Fig. 13 , receives an input of the number of equivalent cycles.     [0122]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1322 in Fig. 13 , selects two numbers of equivalent cycles between which the input number of equivalent cycles is interposed, from the plurality of numbers of equivalent cycles 1300 stored in the memory mechanism 1040. One of the two selected numbers of equivalent cycles is smaller than the input number of equivalent cycles. The other of the two selected numbers of equivalent cycles is larger than the input number of equivalent cycles. The two selected numbers of equivalent cycles are preferably adjacent to each other in the plurality of numbers of equivalent cycles 1300 stored in the memory mechanism 1040.     [0123]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1323 in Fig. 13 , extracts a power-prioritized resource matrix corresponding to each of the two selected numbers of equivalent cycles, from the plurality of power-prioritized resource matrices 1301 stored in the memory mechanism 1040, to thereby extract two power-prioritized resource matrices.     [0124]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1324 in Fig. 13 , calculates a power-prioritized output matrix in such a manner as shown in the steps 1121 to 1128 in Fig. 4 by using each of the two extracted power-prioritized resource matrices as a resource matrix to be referred, to thereby calculate two power-prioritized resource matrices.     [0125]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041 performs linear interpolation in the two selected numbers of equivalent cycles and the two calculated power-prioritized output matrices, to thereby calculate a power-prioritized output matrix corresponding to the input number of equivalent cycles. Interpolation in the other way than linear interpolation may be performed. As a result of this, a power-prioritized output matrix which is adoptable in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in a case where a deterioration state of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is indicated by the input number of equivalent cycles, is calculated.     [0126]    By obtaining a power-prioritized output matrix corresponding to the input number of equivalent cycles in the above-described manner, the number of power-prioritized resource matrices stored in the memory mechanism 1040 is reduced, so that a storage capacity of the memory mechanism 1040 can be reduced.     10 Output of power-prioritized resource matrix for each upper limit of temperature    [0127]    Below, there will be described an embodiment in which a calculation mechanism calculates a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where a rise in a temperature of a sodium-sulfur battery to the maximum allowable temperature is permissible (which will be hereinafter referred to as a ""a power-prioritized output matrix for a maximum allowable operation""), and a power-prioritized resource matrix for a case where a rise in a temperature of a sodium-sulfur battery to a recommended operation temperature is permissible (which will be hereinafter referred to as a ""power-prioritized output matrix for a recommended operation"").     [0128]    A schematic view of Fig. 14 shows data stored in a memory mechanism in a case where a calculation mechanism outputs a power-prioritized output matrix for a maximum allowable operation and a power-prioritized output matrix for a recommended operation. A schematic view of Fig. 15 shows a flow of process performed by a calculation mechanism in a case where a calculation mechanism outputs a power-prioritized output matrix for a maximum allowable operation and a power-prioritized output matrix for a recommended operation.     [0129]    A maximum allowable temperature is determined so as to ensure prevention of breakdown of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 while a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is not higher than a maximum allowable temperature. Thus, a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 should not be higher than a maximum allowable temperature even for a short period of time. A recommended operation temperature is determined so as to ensure retention of predetermined performance over a predetermined life in the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 while a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is not higher than a recommended operation temperature. Thus, though a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is allowed to become higher than a recommended operation temperature only for a short period of time, a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is preferably set to be not higher than a recommended operation temperature.     [0130]    According to the present embodiment, as shown in Fig. 14 , the memory mechanism 1040 stores a power-prioritized resource matrix 1330 for a case where a rise in a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 to a maximum allowable temperature is permissible (which will be hereinafter referred to as a ""power-prioritized resource matrix 1330 for a maximum allowable operation""), and a power-prioritized resource matrix 1331 in a case where a rise in a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 to a recommended operation temperature is permissible (which will be hereinafter referred to as a ""power-prioritized resource matrix 1331 for a recommended operation"").     [0131]    Each of the power-prioritized resource matrix 1330 for a maximum allowable operation and the power-prioritized resource matrix 1331 for a recommended operation is a candidate for a resource matrix to be referred.     [0132]    According to the present embodiment, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1341 in Fig. 15 , calculates a power-prioritized output matrix in such a manner as shown in the steps 1121 to 1128 in Fig. 4 by using the power-prioritized resource matrix 1330 for a maximum allowable operation as a resource matrix to be referred, to thereby calculate a power-prioritized output matrix for a maximum allowable operation.     [0133]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1342 in Fig. 15 , calculates a power-prioritized output matrix in such a manner as shown in the steps 1121 to 1128 in Fig. 4 by using the power-prioritized resource matrix 1331 for a recommended operation as a resource matrix to be referred, to thereby calculate a power-prioritized output matrix for a recommended operation.     [0134]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1343 in Fig. 15 , calculates a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where a rise in a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 to a temperature which is intermediate between a maximum allowable temperature and a recommended operation temperature is permissible. A power-prioritized output matrix for a case where a rise in a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 to a temperature which is intermediate between a maximum allowable temperature and a recommended operation temperature is permissible, is calculated, for example, by carrying out arithmetic averaging or weighted averaging on a power-prioritized output matrix for a maximum allowable operation and a power-prioritized output matrix for a recommended operation. In the step 1343, two or more power-prioritized output matrices which are different from each other in weighting coefficient, may be calculated. The step 1343 may be omitted.     [0135]    Each or either of a maximum allowable temperature and a recommended operation temperature may be changed to an upper limit of temperature other than a maximum allowable temperature and a recommended operation temperature. More generally, the calculation mechanism 1041 calculates a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where a rise in a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 to a relatively high upper limit of temperature TH is permissible, and a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where a rise in a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 to a relatively low upper limit of temperature TL (TL<TH) is permissible.     [0136]    In place of a power-prioritized output matrix, or in addition to a power-prioritized output matrix, similar calculations may be performed with respect to a time-prioritized output matrix.     11 Output of power-prioritized output matrix for each heat dissipation amount    [0137]    Below, there will be described an embodiment in which a calculation mechanism calculates a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from a sodium-sulfur battery is a maximum heat dissipation amount and a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from a sodium-sulfur battery is a minimum heat dissipation amount, in a case where an amount of heat dissipated from a sodium-sulfur battery is variable.     [0138]    A schematic view of Fig. 16 shows data stored in a memory mechanism in a case where a calculation mechanism calculates a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from a sodium-sulfur battery is a maximum heat dissipation amount, and a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from a sodium-sulfur battery is a minimum heat dissipation amount. A schematic view of Fig. 17 is a flow chart showing a flow of processes performed by a calculation mechanism in a case where the calculation mechanism calculates a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from a sodium-sulfur battery is a maximum heat dissipation amount and a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from a sodium-sulfur battery is a minimum heat dissipation amount.     [0139]    According to the present embodiment, as shown in Fig. 16 , the memory mechanism 1040 stores a power-prioritized resource matrix 1350 for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a maximum heat dissipation amount, and a power-prioritized resource matrix 1351 for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a minimum heat dissipation amount.     [0140]    Each of the power-prioritized resource matrix 1350 for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a maximum heat dissipation amount, and the power-prioritized resource matrix 1351 for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a minimum heat dissipation amount, is a candidate for a resource matrix to be referred.     [0141]    According to the present embodiment, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1361 in Fig. 17 , calculates a power-prioritized output matrix in such a manner as shown in the steps 1121 to 1128 in Fig. 4 by using the power-prioritized resource matrix 1350 for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a maximum heat dissipation amount, as a resource matrix to be referred, to thereby calculate a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a maximum heat dissipation amount.     [0142]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1362 in Fig. 17 , calculates a power-prioritized output matrix in such a manner as shown in the steps 1121 to 1128 in Fig. 4 by using the power-prioritized resource matrix 1351 for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a minimum heat dissipation amount, as a resource matrix to be referred, to thereby calculate a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a minimum heat dissipation amount.     [0143]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1363 in Fig. 17 , calculates a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a heat dissipation amount which is intermediate between a maximum heat dissipation amount and a minimum heat dissipation amount. A power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a heat dissipation amount which is intermediate between a maximum heat dissipation amount and a minimum heat dissipation amount, is calculated, for example, by carrying out arithmetic averaging or weighted averaging on a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a maximum heat dissipation amount and a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a minimum heat dissipation amount. In the step 1363, two or more power-prioritized output matrices which are different from each other in weighting coefficient, may be calculated.     [0144]    Subsequently, the calculation mechanism 1041, in a step 1364 in Fig. 17 , calculates an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a heat dissipation amount which is intermediate between a maximum heat dissipation amount and a minimum heat dissipation amount. The steps 1363 and 1364 may be omitted.     [0145]    In a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a maximum heat dissipation amount, while power which can be discharged by the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is increased and a period of time during which the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 can continue discharging is lengthened, there is a strong possibility that power consumed by a heater for heating the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in order to maintain a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 would be increased. On the other hand, in a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a minimum heat dissipation amount, while power which can be discharged by the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is reduced and a period of time during which the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 can continue discharging is shortened, there is a strong possibility that power consumed by a heater for heating the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 in order to maintain a temperature of the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 would be reduced. Output of a plurality of power-prioritized output matrices which are differentiated from each other in an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020, such as a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a relatively large heat dissipation amount W1 and a power-prioritized output matrix for a case where an amount of heat dissipated from the sodium-sulfur battery 1020 is a relatively small heat dissipation amount W2 (W2<W1), would help an operator in selecting an appropriate charge/discharge condition, and calculation in conjunction with a heat dissipation amount would facilitate more quantitative determination.     12 Calculation of a plurality of charge/discharge time periods    [0146]    Below, there will be described an embodiment in which the calculation mechanism 1041 calculates a power-prioritized output matrix with respect to each of a plurality of charge/discharge time periods.     [0147]    A schematic view of Fig. 18 shows processes performed in calculation of a power-prioritized output matrix with respect to each of a plurality of charge/discharge time periods.     [0148]    As shown in Fig. 18 , the calculation mechanism 1041 receives an input of a state indicator from the control device 1011 with respect to the first charge/discharge time period, calculates a power-prioritized output matrix, inputs the calculated power-prioritized output matrix to the monitoring device 1013, and calculates a post-charge/discharge state indicator. Also, when i is a natural number, the calculation mechanism 1041 receives, as a new state indicator, an input of a post-charge/discharge state indicator which is calculated with respect to the i-th charge/discharge time period, and calculates a charge/discharge condition and a post-charge/discharge state indicator with respect to the (i+1)-th charge/discharge time period following the i-th charge/discharge time period. As a result of this, in a case where a state indicator is input to the calculation mechanism 1041 from an outside of the data logger 1012 with respect to the first charge/discharge time period, a power-prioritized output matrix with respect to each of all of charge/discharge time periods after the first charge/discharge time period is calculated in a chain-like manner. In a plurality of charge/discharge time periods, a charge time period may occur after a discharge time period, a discharge time period may occur after a charge time period, a discharge time period in which discharge is conducted under one discharge condition may occur after a discharge time period in which discharge is conducted under another discharge condition, or a charge time period in which charge is conducted under one charge condition may occur after a charge time period in which charge is conducted under another charge condition.     [0149]    In place of a power-prioritized output matrix, or in addition to a power-prioritized output matrix, similar calculations may be performed with respect to a time-prioritized output matrix.     [0150]    While the invention has been shown and described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is therefore understood that numerous modifications and variations can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention.

Moreover, the present invention relates to a level instrument which is able to measure any inclination and is configured to use gravity since it is equipped with a luminous element, and in particular to a level instrument for measuring any inclination, wherein it is possible to measure the horizontality of a structure and an inclination angle of a structure, and a remote work can be easily carried out at a time using a laser diode.      Background Art     [0002]    A level instrument, in general, is used to measure a horizontal or vertical state of a target or a predetermined inclination at an industrial site, for example, a construction site, a factory, etc. or at home. For example, the horizontal or vertical state of a predetermined building can be measured using a level instrument at a construction site. The measurement may be carried out in such a way to dispose a level instrument on the surface of a structure which will be measured. Moreover, when installing furniture, etc. at home, the level instrument may be used so as to check the horizontality of the furniture.     [0003]    In the simplest type of the level instrument is configured, bubbles are used. The level instrument is equipped with a transparent tube filled with a liquid, for example, water, and the bubbles are filled together with water in the transparent tube. The bubblers are tended to move in the transparent tube based on the inclination of the level instrument. A user can measure any inclination by checking the position of the bubbles inside of the transparent tube. For example, if the bubbles position within a limit line indicated on the surface of the transparent tube, it means that the inclination is horizontal, and if the bubbles are out of the indicated line of the transparent tube, it means that the inclination is not horizontal.     [0004]    Since the conventional level instrument is equipped with a transparent tube installed at a level instrument body, it needs a predetermined lighting device when work is necessary in a dark place or at night. More specifically, when it needs to do a work in an indoor space where electric power is not available, it is not easy to visually see the movements of small bubbles. Moreover, if a user's eye sight is not good, the user may feel uneasy to accurately recognize the movements of bubbles which are floating in the liquid filled in the transparent tube.     [0005]    Furthermore, the level instrument is configured to measure the horizontality of a predetermined structure, but according to situations, it may need to measure an inclination angle at which a structure is inclined. The conventional level instrument is originally designed to measure the horizontality of a structure, not configured to measure an inclination direction or an inclination angle of a predetermined floor. Moreover, it is not able to measure an inclination angle of a pillar or a wall body. The conventional level instrument is unable to adjust a horizontality up to a predetermined distance, for which a remote distance work is not easy using the conventional level instrument.      Disclosure of Invention     [0006]    The present invention is made in an effort to solve the aforementioned problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved level instrument.     [0007]    It is another object of the present invention to provide a level instrument which can be used conveniently in a dark place or at night without using a predetermined lighting device.     [0008]    It is further another object of the present invention to provide a level instrument which may allow a user to easily measure horizontal and vertical states and a predetermined inclination.

Modes for carrying out the invention     [0030]    The present invention will be described in details in conjunction with the embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings.     [0031]    The advantages and features of the present invention and the ways to achieve them will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings and become apparent. It is noted that the present invention is not limited to the descriptions disclosed below, and can be implemented in various forms, provided that it is provided to make more perfect the disclosure of the present invention and inform a person having ordinary skill in the art of the scope of the present invention. The present invention should be defined by the scope of the claims, and the same reference numbers of the present invention represent the same components.     [0032]    Figure 1 is a schematic view for describing a level instrument according to an embodiment of the present invention.     [0033]    Referring to Figure 1 , the level instrument body 10 according to the present invention may include a measuring part (M) indicated by a dotted line. The detailed configuration of the measuring part (M) is indicated by an arrow mark (A) shown at a side of the enlarged perspective view.     [0034]    The level instrument according to an embodiment of the present invention may include, but is not limited to, a level instrument body 10, one or more transparent tubes 11 and 15 which are installed at the level instrument body 10 and are filled with bubbles 12 and liquid, a nonconductive plate 61 which is installed at the level instrument body 10, wherein one to four pairs of electrodes 51 a, 51 b, 52a, 52b, 53a, 53b, 54a and 54b are disposed at an inner circumferential surface of a circular inner space 61 a, a conductive disk 62 which is configured to electrically connect any of one to four pairs of the electrodes based on a rolling position on the inner circumferential surface of the nonconductive plate 61, and one or more oscillators 57 which are installed at the level instrument body 10 so as to emit a laser light (L) when any of one to four pairs of the electrodes are electrically connected.     [0035]    The level instrument body 10 may be configured in a rectangular parallelepiped shape which is longitudinal like a typical level instrument and may have various shapes in another example. The transparent tubes 11 and 15 installed at the level instrument body 10 may be configured in a shape similar with a conventional level instrument. Each of the transparent tubes 11 and 15 is filled with a liquid and bubbles. The positions of the bubbles in the insides of the transparent tubes 11 and 15 may change based on a state where the level instrument 10 is disposed.     [0036]    The transparent tubes 11 and 15 may allow to recognize a horizontal or vertical state or a 45 inclined state based on an installation position with respect to the body 10. In the drawings, a pair of indication lines 11a are indicated on the surface of a first transparent tube 11, which shows a horizontal state of the level instrument. If the bubbles move within a pair of the indication lines 11 a, it is judged that a horizontal state has been made. A pair of the indication lines same as the above lines may be indicated at a second transparent tube 15 which shows a vertical state of the level instrument. If the bubbles move within the indication lines, it may be judged that a vertical state has been made. A transparent tube which is able to indicate a 45 inclination, may be installed according to another example which is not illustrated in the drawings.     [0037]    According to one feature of the present invention, the measuring part (M) may include a nonconductive plate 61, and a conductive disk 62. In the nonconductive plate 61, a circular inner space 61a is formed passing through the nonconductive plate 61.     [0038]    The nonconductive plate 61 may be made of a nonconductive material, for example, a plastic material, and one to four pairs of the electrodes 51 a, 51 b, 52a, 52b, 53a, 53b, 54a and 54b may be formed on the inner surface of the conductive plate 61. There may be provided a conductive plate 62 which is configured to roll on an inner surface of the inner space 61 a so as to electrically connect any of one to four pairs of the electrodes. Moreover, in order to prevent the conductive disk 62 from separating from the inner space 61a of the nonconductive plate 61 a cover (not illustrated) may be provided at a front surface and rear surface of the nonconductive plate 61 so as to close the inner space 61 a of the nonconductive plate 61.     [0039]    A conductive wire is extending via the nonconductive plate 61 from one to four pairs of the electrodes 51 a, 51 b, 52a, 52b, 53a, 53b, 54a and 54b. The wire 63 is connected to a battery (B) and a laser light oscillator 57. In an example illustrated in the drawing, it is illustrated in the drawings that the wire 63 has been connected to the batter (B) and the laser light oscillator 57 with respect to only one pair of the electrodes, but it should be understood that two to four pairs of the electrodes may be connected to the battery (B) and the laser light oscillator 57. Each pair of the electrodes are electrically connected with each other based on the rolling position of the conductive disk 62.     [0040]    Each pair of the electrodes are disposed at an angle of 90 with respect to each other when viewing from the front side. More specifically, a first pair of the electrodes 51 a and 51 b are disposed in a 6-clock direction (a lower portion), and a second pair of the electrodes 52a and 52b are disposed in a 9-clock direction (a left portion), and a third pair of the electrodes 53a and 53b are disposed in a 12-clock direction (an upper portion), and a fourth pair of the electrodes 54a and 54b are disposed in a 3-clock direction (a right portion).     [0041]    The diameter of the circular conductive disk 62 is smaller than the diameter of the circular inner space 61a, and an outer circumferential surface of the conductive disk 62 may partially contact with an inner circumferential surface of the inner space 61 a. Since the outer circumferential surface of the conductive disk 62 contacts with any of one to four pairs of the electrodes, any of one to four pairs of the electrodes can be electrically connected.     [0042]    The moment when any of one to four pairs of the electrodes is connected by the conductive disk 62, may match with the moment the bubbles 12 move into the indication line 11 a in the transparent tubes 11 and 15. More specifically, the nonconductive plate 61 may be installed at the level instrument body 10 in such a way that any of one to four pairs of the electrodes can be connected by the conductive disk 62 at the moment when the level instrument is disposed at a horizontal or vertical position.     [0043]    Since the conductive disk 62 moves rolling on the inner surface of the inner space 61 a when the level instrument separates from a horizontal or vertical state, the electrodes may separate from the connected states. Thereafter, a laser oscillation does not occur by the laser oscillator 57, which means that a horizontal or vertical state has not been made.     [0044]    One to four pairs of the electrodes 51 a, 51 b, 52a, 52b, 53a, 53b, 54a and 54b are connected via an electric cable 63 to the battery (B) and the laser light oscillator 57. When any pair of the electrodes is electrically connected, a laser light can be emitted from the laser light oscillator 57. The laser light oscillator 57 can be installed at a side of the level instrument body 10. The laser light may be oriented to a point which is at a right angle with respect to the horizontal surface of a measuring target, from which a user is able to recognize that the point at which the laser light arrives, is at a right angle with respect to a plane where the level instrument is placed.     [0045]    As illustrated in the drawing, one electrode among a pair of the electrodes 51 a and 51 b is connected to a first terminal of the laser oscillator 57. Moreover, a second electrode of the battery (B) is connected to a second terminal of the laser oscillator 57. The conductive disk 62 plays a role of a switch. When the electrodes 51 a and 51 b are connected by the conductive disk 62, a laser light oscillates from the laser light oscillator 57, which means that a horizontal state has been made.     [0046]    The level instrument body 10 may include, but is not limited to, the laser oscillator 57 as well as a lighting element 25 which is for the sake of a luminous element 27 and a transparent tube 11. Electric power can be supplied from the battery (B) to the luminous element 27 and the lighting element 25. The conductive disk 62 may play a role of the switch which is able to supply or block the electric power supply from the battery (B). More specifically, the luminous element 27 and the lighting element 25 can emit light at the moment when the conductive disk 61 connects any pair of one to four pairs of the electrodes. It is preferred that the luminous element 27 and the lighting element 25 may be formed of luminous diodes, and the battery (B) is rechargeable.     [0047]    Figure 2 is a perspective view illustrating a level instrument which is able to measure a predetermined inclination angle since it is equipped with a laser luminous member according to the present invention.     [0048]    Referring to Figure 2 , in the level instrument which is equipped with a laser luminous member and is able to measure an inclination angle, the level instrument may include a case 100, and the case 100 is formed of a reference surface which contacts closely with the level instrument, another reference surface which is defined at a right angle with respect to the former reference surface, and a plane which is defined at a right angle with respect to the latter reference surface.     [0049]    The case 100 may be equipped with a plurality of level meters 200. Each level meter 200 is provided in the case made of a transparent material. Moreover, a lighting part 410 may be further provided inside each level meter 200, by which the level meters can be checked even when there is not any light.     [0050]    Moreover, any of a plurality of the level meters 200 provided at the case 100 is equipped with a buoyancy angle indicator 1000 which is installed rotatable on the plane and is able to measure an inclination angle of a predetermined structure using a buoyancy.     [0051]    The buoyancy angle indicator 1000 may be formed of a rotation part 1100 on which the level meters are mounted, and a fixed part 1200 wherein a reference mark 1210 is indicated on an outer rim of the rotation part 1100, wherein the reference mark 1210 is referred to a reference point to measure a gradation indicating an angle and a rotated angle. A protrusion part 1120 is provided on the top of the rotation part 1100 so as to allow an easier rotation, and a liquid accommodation part 1300 containing air bubbles 1310 is provided inside.     [0052]    The liquid accommodation part 1300 may be configured in a circular pillar shape or a polygonal pillar shape and is sealed for an inside liquid not to leak. Moreover, an indication mark 1320 indicating a gradation indicated on the fixed part is formed on the surface thereof, wherein the indication mark 1320 is disposed longitudinally inside of the rotation part 1100 and is made of a transparent material in order for the center axis of the circular pillar or the polygonal pillar to be parallel to the surface of the plane, by means of which the center axis of the liquid accommodation part can be referred to the rotated angle.     [0053]    Moreover, there is provided a gravity angle indicator which is installed at the case 100 and is able to indicate angles using the gravity. The gravity angle indicator is equipped with an angle indication part 300 which is mounted on the case 100 and rotates, thus measuring an inclination angle of a predetermined structure.     [0054]    A plurality of laser diodes 400 are installed at the case 100 so as to measure any inclination angle by turning on a laser. The laser diode 400 which is able to emit an emitted straight light, may be disposed inside of the case 100 in order for the straight light to be parallel to one reference surface, and another laser diode 400 may be disposed inside of the case 100 in order for an emitted straight light to be parallel to another reference surface.     [0055]    The configuration and function thereof will be described below.     [0056]    There are provided a lighting switch 520 which is able to determine an electric power supply state to the lighting part 410, and a laser switch 530 which is able to determine an electric power supply state to the laser diode 400.     [0057]    Figure 3 is a wiring layout view illustrating a level instrument which is able to measure a predetermined inclination angle since it is equipped with a laser luminous member according to the present invention.     [0058]    Referring to Figure 3 , a gravity angle indicator is installed at the case 100 and is able to indicate an angle using the gravity.     [0059]    The gravity angle indicator may include an angle indication part 300 which is mounted on the case and rotates, an electric power supply part 500 which is provided inside of the case and is able to supply electric power, a laser diode 400 which is provided inside of the case and is able to generate a straight light source, and a conductor part 320 which is able to move to the lower most position based on the received gravity.     [0060]    The angle indication part 300 may include a rotation body 310 which is disposed rotatable on the plant of the case 100, and a gradation indication part 330 wherein gradations corresponding to angles are indicated on an outer rim of the rotation body 310, wherein the conductor part 320 is disposed inside of the rotation body 310.     [0061]    The rotation body 310 is disposed rotatable at the case 100. In order for the rotation body 310 to be rotatable, there may be a way wherein a thrust bearing is used, and another way wherein a groove is formed at an outer circumferential surface, and a stopper connected to a spring is fitted into the groove. In addition to these ways, various other ways may be used for the same purpose.     [0062]    Moreover, it is preferred that the rotation body 310 is made of a nonconductive material, for example, wood, plastic, rubber, etc. which are not able to transfer electricity or heat since they have high resistances with respect to electricity or heat.     [0063]    Furthermore, the rotation body 310 is equipped with a through hollow configuration, wherein an electric power contact point 311 is disposed at a hollow inner circumferential surface. There is provided a ring part 312 which is connected to the electric power contact part 311 and is disposed at an outer circumferential surface of the rotation body 310 and has a conductive property.     [0064]    The electric power contact part 311 is formed of an electric power contact point (A) 311 a and an electric power contact point (B) 311 b and may include a conductor part 320 which is employed to connect the electric power contact point (A) 311 a and the electric power contact point (B) 311 b. The conductor part 320 may be manufactured in a ball shape or a circular plate shape.     [0065]    The ring part 312 may be formed of a ring part (A) 312a and a ring part (B) 312b.     [0066]    An electric power supply part 500 may be provided at the laser diode 400 so as to supply electric power, whereupon the electric power supplied from the electric power supply part 500 can be supplied to the laser diode 500 via the ring part 312 and the electric power contact part 311, thus turning on the laser diode 500.     [0067]    Moreover, there are provided a lighting switch 520 which is able to determine an electric power supply state to the lighting part 410, and a laser switch 530 which is able to determine an electric power supply state to the laser diode 400.     [0068]    If the conductive part 310 is disposed at an intermediate portion of the electric power contact part 311, the electric power contact part can be connected, and the laser diode 400 can be turned on.     [0069]    An inclination angle of the structure can be measured using the aforementioned structure. If the rotation body is rotated at a predetermined angle to be measured, when the measurement reference surface (a surface contacting with the structure in Figure 5 ) matches with the angle to be measured, the electric power contact part 311 can be disposed facing the ground.     [0070]    In this state, the conductive part 310 will move by the gravity and will be disposed between the electric power contact parts, by which the electric power contact point (A) 311 a and the electric power contact point (B) are connected, thus conducting electric power.     [0071]    More specifically, the conductive part 310 can be disposed at an intermediate portion of the electric power contact part 311 with the aid of the gravity, and in this state, the electric power contact part 311 is electrically conducted, thus turning on the laser diode 400. The direction of the beam that the laser diode emits can be matched with the surface of the structure, which may indicate an inclination angle of the structure.     [0072]    If the laser switch 530 is on, the electric power contact part 311 is electrically conducted, so the laser diode 400 can be turned on, and if the laser switch 530 is off, even though the electric power contact part 311 is electrically conducted, the laser diode 400 may become an off state.     [0073]    In the same way, if the lighting switch 520 is on, the lighting part 410 can be turned on, and if the lighting switch 520 is off, the lighting part 410 can be turned off.     [0074]    Figure 4 is a plane cross sectional view (A) of a rotation member and a side cross sectional view (B) of the rotation member according to the present invention.     [0075]    Referring to Figure 4 , it is preferred that the rotation body 310 is made of a material having a nonconductive property, for example, wood, plastic, etc. which is not able to transfer electricity or heat since it has a high resistance with respect to electricity or heat, and the rotation body 310 may include a through hollow shape.     [0076]    The electric power contact point (A) 311 a and the electric power contact point (B) 311 b are provided at an inner circumferential surface of the hollow shape. The ring part (A) 312a and the ring part (B) 312b are provided at an outer circumferential surface of the rotation body.     [0077]    Here, the ring part (A) 312a is connected with the electric power contact point (A) 311 a, and the ring part (B) 312b is connected with the electric power contact point (B) 311 b.     [0078]    The ring part (A) 312a slide-contacts with a wire 540a, and the ring part (B) 312b slide-contacts with a wire 540b.     [0079]    Even when the rotation body 310 is rotating, the ring part (A) 312a and the ring part (B) 312b can keep a slide-contact with the wires 540a and 540b, by which electric current can be continuously supplied. Even when the rotation body 310 rotates, the conductor part 320 can position in the middle of the electric power contact part 311 with the aid of the aforementioned structure, by means of which the laser diode 400 can be turned on.     [0080]    Figure 5 is a detailed view illustrating a buoyancy angle indicator according to the present invention.     [0081]    The buoyancy angle indicator 1000 may include a rotation part 1100 on which the level meter is mounted, and a fixed part 1200 wherein a reference mark 1210 has been indicated at an outer rim of the rotation part 1000, the reference mark 1210 corresponding to a reference point to measure any gradation corresponding to angles, and the rotated angle.     [0082]    A protrusion part 1120 is provided on the top of the rotation part 1100 so as to allow an easier rotation, and an angle fixing groove 1110 having an inner groove is formed on an outer circumferential surface, and a liquid accommodation part 1300 containing air bubbles 1310 is provided inside.     [0083]    There is provided a stopper part 5000 to fix at a predetermined angle the rotation part 1100. The stopper part 5000 is disposed inside of the case 100. Since a stopper is fitted in the angle fixing groove 1110 so as to fix the rotation part 1100, the rotation part 1100 can be fixed.     [0084]    If the rotation part 1100 rotates, the spring is contracted, and the stopper separates from the angle fixing groove 1110, whereby the rotation part 1100 can rotate.     [0085]    The liquid accommodation part 1300 is formed in a circular pillar shape or a polygonal pillar shape and is selected to prevent any leakage of the inside liquid. It is disposed in a longitudinal direction in the inside of the rotation part 1100 in such a way that a center axis of a circular pillar or a polygonal pillar can be parallel to the surface of the plane.     [0086]    The liquid accommodation part 1300 is made of a transparent material, and an indication mark 1320 may be formed on a surface thereof so as to indicate the gradations indicated on the fixed part, by which it is possible to check the angle where the center axis of the liquid accommodation part has rotated.     [0087]    Figure 6 is a right side cross sectional view illustrating a buoyancy angle indicator according to the present invention.     [0088]    A through hole is formed at the case 100. The buoyancy angle indicator 1000 may be inserted into the through hole, so the level meter can be checked from both the plane and the bottom surface. The fixed part 1200 of the buoyancy angle indicator 1000 can be fixed by a protrusion part formed at a lower portion of the groove of the case 100, and the fixing cover 2000, and the bottom surface of the fixed part 1200 may be formed in a through hollow shape or may be formed of a transparent material, by which the level meter inserted in the inside of the buoyancy angle indicator 1000 can be checked from both surfaces.     [0089]    The rotation part 1000 inserted inside the fixed part 1200 may be equipped with a protrusion part 1120 employed at the top thereof so as to cause an easier rotation. An angle fixing groove 1110 having an inner groove may be formed on an outer circumferential surface thereof.     [0090]    A fixing cover 2000 may be provided, which is able to fix the buoyancy angle indicator. The fixing cover 2000 may be engaged to the case 100 with the aid of the engaging groove.     [0091]    Moreover, the protrusion part 1120 is disposed hidden from the outside so as to prevent any damage thereof at a construction site.     [0092]    Figures 7 and 8 are views for describing embodiments of the present invention.     [0093]    Referring to Figure 7 , if a reference surface of the case 100 is attached to an inclination surface of a predetermined structure in order to measure an inclination angle of the structure which has been inclined at a predetermined angle (Q1), the conductive part 320 will move by the gravity and separate from the electric power contact part 311.     [0094]    Moreover, the angle formed between the inclination of a predetermined reference line connecting the electric power contact part 311 and the ground surface which is horizontal to the inclination of a predetermined reference line is same as the inclination angle (Q1) of the structure.     [0095]    Referring to Figure 8 , the rotation body 310 is rotated for a predetermined reference line connecting the electric power contact part 311 to be parallel to the ground surface so that the conductive part 3110, which has moved by the gravity, can be disposed at an intermediate portion of the electric power contact part 311.     [0096]    If the rotation body 310 is rotated at an angle (Q2), the conductive part 310 may position at an intermediate portion of the electric power contact part 311, by which the electric power contact part 311 can be electrically conducted, thus turning on the laser diode 400.     [0097]    The angle (Q2) at which the rotation body 310 has rotated, corresponds to the angle at which the electric power contact part 311 has moved to be horizontal (0) to the ground surface from the angle (Q1) between the inclination of a predetermined reference line connecting the electric power contact part 311, and the horizontal ground surface, from which the inclination angle of the structure can be Q1=Q2.     [0098]    Moreover, in the buoyancy angle indicator 1000 configured to measure an inclination angle using a buoyancy, the case 100 is attached to an inclined surface of the structure so as to measure an inclination angle of the structure which has been inclined at a predetermined angle (Q1), the level meter attached to the inside of the rotation part 1100 is at a right angle with respect to the structure, and the rotation part 1100 is rotated and adjusted at an angle Q2 in order for the level meter attached to the inside of the rotation part 1100 to be horizontal to the ground surface and in order for the air bubbles to move within the horizontal reference line.     [0099]    If the air bubbles 1310 move within the horizontal reference line and are adjusted horizontal to the ground surface (Q1=Q2), a predetermined inclined angle can be obtained using a gradation difference between the reference mark 1210 of the fixed part 1200 and the indication mark 1320 of the liquid accommodation part 1300.     [0100]    Figure 9 is a view illustrating further another example of a level instrument which is able to measure a predetermined inclination angle since it is equipped with a laser luminous member according to the present invention.     [0101]    Referring to Figure 9 , the laser diode 400 may further include a cylinder lens 600. The cylinder lens 600 is able to convert a point light source coming in from the laser diode 400 into a line-shaped light source. This line-shaped light may be used for various applications, if necessary.

Bei der Alzheimer Demenz (Alzheimer disease, AD) und der zerebralen -Amyloidangiopathie (CAA) ist die Aggregation von -Amyloid-Peptiden(A) krankheitsauslsend, wobei der zugrunde liegende Mechanismus nicht bekannt ist. Die A-Proteostase, d.h. das Gleichgewicht von Produktion und Abbau/Abtransport mittels Rezeptoren oder Proteasen, ist bei der AD und CAA gestrt. Der Entfernung der A-Peptide durch zellulre Transporter (ABC Transporter) wurde jedoch bisher wenig Beachtung beigemessen. Bei der Parkinson-Krankheit (Morbus Parkinson) akkumuliert das Protein -Synuclein, welches unter anderem die Dopamin-Ausschttung in der Substantia nigra reguliert. Bei der -Synucleinopathie Morbus Parkinson ist es bekannt, dass ABC-Transporter eine entscheidende Rolle fr den Transport spielen ( Kortekaaset al., Ann Neurol 2005, 57, 176-179 ). Hierbei existieren mehrere Subfamilien A-G, die wechselseitig verschiedene Substrate transportieren knnen (Metaboliten, Medikamente, Peptide, Proteine, Ionen) und sogar in der Lage sind sich gegenseitig in der Transportfunktion zu ersetzen (z.B. ABCB1 und ABCC1, Tao et al. Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology, 64, 5, 961-969 ).     [0002]    Mittels verschiedener gentechnisch vernderter Mausmodelle konnte gezeigt werden, dass der ABC-Transporter (gemeinsames Strukturelement der ABC-Transporter ist eine ATP-bindende Kassette und eine Transportpore) ABCC1, ein wichtiger Protein/Peptid-Transporter, insbesondere A-Transporter ist, der auergewhnliche funktionelle Auswirkungen auf die zerebrale Protein-Akkumulation hat. ABCC1 ist ebenso ein wichtiger -Synuclein-Transporter.     [0003]    Nachfolgend werden die Untersuchungen zur Transporter-Aktivitt exemplarisch am A-Transport dargestellt.     [0004]    Zur Bestimmung der ABCC1-Aktivittin vivowurde bei APP-exprimierenden, transgenen Musen jeweils der ABCB1-, der ABCG2- oder der ABCC1-Transporter gentechnisch entfernt (knockout Muse).     [0005]    Dabei wurde gefunden, dass:i) die Menge von A in den Musen, denen der ABCC1 Transporter fehlte, um das 12-fache gesteigert war,ii) der ABCB1-Transporterverlust nur zu einer 3-fachen Erhhung fhrt undiii) der ABCG2-Verlust keine A-akkumulierende Auswirkung hat.    [0006]    Aufgabe der vorliegenden Erfindung war es daher, Substanzen bereit zu stellen, welche den ABCC1-Transporter in geeigneter Weise beeinflussen, um so neurodegenerative Erkrankungen, insbesondere -Amyloidopathien oder -Synucleopathien, behandeln zu knnen. Diese Aufgabe wurde mit 2-(R<2>-Thio)-10-[3-(4-R<1>-piperazin-1-yl)propyl]-10H-phenothiazinen gem Anspruch 1 gelst. Weitere bevorzugte Ausfhrungsformen ergeben sich aus den abhngigen Ansprchen.     [0007]    In anderen Worten wurde die Aufgabe durch 2-(R<2>-Thio)-10-[3-(4-R<1>-piperazin-1-yl)propyl]-10H-phenothiazine gem der allgemeinen Formel I gelst,<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""395582111-ib0001"" />wobei die ResteR<1> und R<2> gleich oder verschieden sind und jeweils unabhngig voneinander C1 -C6 -Alkylgruppen sind, welche unabhngig voneinander gegebenenfalls einen weiteren Substituenten ausgewhlt aus Alkyl-, Aryl-, Acyl- (vorzugsweise Acetyl-), Amino-, Nitro-, Sulfonyl-, Hydroxyl-, Alkoxy-, Aryloxy-, Arylthio-, Alkylthio-Gruppe und Halogenatom aufweisen, wobei die jeweiligen Alkylgruppen gegebenenfalls mindestens ein weiteres Halogenatom aufweisen und der Rest R<3> sich an einer der Positionen 6-9 des Phenothiazin-Ringsystems befindet und ein Wasserstoffatom oder eine Alkyl-, Aryl-, Acyl- (vorzugsweise Acetyl-), Amino-, Nitro-, Sulfonyl-, Hydroxyl-, Alkoxy-, Aryloxy-, Arylthio- oder Alkylthio-Gruppe oder ein Halogenatom ist, wobei die jeweiligen Alkylgruppen gegebenenfalls mindestens ein weiteres Halogenatom aufweisen, oder eine NR<4> R<5> - oder OR<6> -Gruppe ist, wobei R<4> , R<5> und R<6> gleich oder verschieden sind und jeweils unabhngig voneinander ausgewhlt sind aus Wasserstoff und C1 -C3 -Alkylgruppe und der RestR<7> sich an einer der Positionen 1, 2 oder 4 des Phenothiazin-Ringsystems befindet und ein Wasserstoffatom oder eine Alkyl-, Aryl-, Acyl- (vorzugsweise Acetyl-), Amino-, Nitro-, Sulfonyl-, Hydroxyl-, Alkoxy-, Aryloxy-, Arylthio- oder Alkylthio-Gruppe oder ein Halogenatom ist, wobei die jeweiligen Alkylgruppen gegebenenfalls mindestens ein weiteres Halogenatom aufweisen, oder eine NR<8> R<9> -oder OR<10> -Gruppe ist, wobei R<8> , R<9> und R<10> gleich oder verschieden sind und jeweils unabhngig voneinander ausgewhlt sind aus Wasserstoff und C1 -C3 -Alkylgruppe,zur Behandlung einer -Amyloidopathie oder einer -Synucleinopathie, welche mit einer zerebralen Proteinablagerung einhergehen.     [0008]    Weiterhin besteht sowohl bei -Synucleinopathien als auch bei -Amyloidopathien ein Bedarf nach Mglichkeiten, diese Krankheiten zu erkennen bzw. zu diagnostizieren oder prdiagnostizieren.     [0009]    Aufgabe der Erfindung war auch die Bereitstellung eines Verfahrens, mit welchem -Synucleinopathien als auch -Amyloidopathien diagnostiziert oder prdiagnostiziert werden knnen. Diese Aufgabe wird mit einem Verfahren gem Anspruch 11 gelst. Bevorzugte Ausfhrungsformen ergeben sich aus den abhngigen Ansprchen. In anderen Worten wird die Aufgabe durch ein Verfahren zur Diagnose oder Prdiagnose einer -Amyloidopathie oder -Synucleopathie oder zur Ermittlung des Risikos eines Probanden, an einer solchen Krankheit zu erkranken, gelst, wobei der Proband bereits Substanzen zu sich nimmt, welche ber den zerebralen ABCC1-Transporter transportiert werden, bestehend aus den folgenden Schritten:a) Bestimmung der Menge der eingenommenen Substanz in Krperflssigkeitsproben des Probanden zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt;b) Wiederholung der Bestimmung des Schrittes a) zu mindestens einem weiteren, spteren Zeitpunkt;c) Vergleich der in Schritt a) und b) ermittelten Mengen mit Mengen, welche zu gleichen Zeitpunkten als charakteristisch fr Probanden definiert worden waren, die zur Zeit der Probennahme keine klinischen Anzeichen einer -Amyloidopathie oder -Synucleopathie zeigten.    [0010]    Dass der Proband bereits mindestens einen Stoff, welcher ber den zerebralen ABCC1-Transporter transportiert wird, zu sich nimmt, bedeutet, dass dieser Stoff nicht erst verabreicht werden muss. Vielmehr ist er im Krper des Probanden bereits vorhanden, beispielsweise aufgrund einer medikamentsen Behandlung einer anderen Erkrankung. Die Krperflssigkeitsproben des Probanden, welche untersucht werden, sind vorzugsweise Proben aus Blutplasma, Blutserum und/oder Nervenwasser.Die -Amyloidopathie ist vorzugsweise eine Alzheimer Demenz, die -Synucleinopathie vorzugsweise die Parkinson'sche Erkrankung. Gegebenenfalls kann die -Synucleinopathie auch eine Lewy-Krperchen-Demenz (DLB) sein. Substanzen, welche ber den zerebralen ABCC1-Transporter transportiert werden, sind vorzugsweise ausgewhlt aus Antibiotika (z.B. Difloxacin, Grepafloxacin), Virostatika/antiviralen Medikamenten (z.B. Saquinavir, Ritonavir), Antiallergika/ Antihistaminika (z.B. Cimetidin), Herz-Kreislauf-Medikamenten (z.B. Verapamil), Antidepressiva (z.B. Citalopram), Antihyperurikmika (z.B. Probenecid), Zytostatika (z.B. Methotrexat, Etoposit, Edatrexat, ZD1694), Vitaminen/Vitaminanaloga (z.B. Methotrexat, Folsure, L-Leucovorin), Antiphlogistika (z.B. Indomethacin), Antiepileptika (z.B. Valproinsure), Hormonen/Hormonderivaten (z.B. 17-Estradiol), Leukotrienen (z.B. LTC4), fluoreszierenden Proben (z.B. Calcein, Fluo-3, BCECF, SNARF), GSH-, Sulfat- oder Glucuronidgekoppelten Metaboliten natrlicher Stoffe (endogen produziert), Toxinen oder von Medikamenten (z.B. 2,4-Dinitrophenyl-SG, Bimane-SG, N-Ethylmaleimid-SG, Doxorubicin-SG, Thiotepa-SG, Cyclophosphamid-SG, Melphalan-SG, Chlorambucil-SG, Ethacrynsure-SG, Metolachlor-SG, Atrazin-SG, Sulforaphan-SG, Aflatoxin B1-Epoxid-SG, 4-Nitroquinolin 1-oxid-SG, As(SG)3, Etoposid-Gluc, 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL)-3-O-Gluc, SN-38-gluc, 4-Methylumbelliferyl--d-gluc, 6-Hydroxy-5,7-dimethyl-2-methylamino-4-(3-pyridylmethyl)-benzothiazolsulfat (E3040S)-Gluc, Leukotrien C4, Prostaglandin A2-SG, 15-deoxy-12,14 prostaglandin J2-SG, Hydroxynonenal-SG , 17-Estradiol-17--d-gluc, Glucuronosylbilirubin, Bislucuronosylbilirubin, Hyodeoxycholate-6--Gluc , Estron-3-Sulfat, Dehydroepiandrosteron-Sulfat, Sulfatolithocholat) (siehe auch Deeley RG et al.: Substrate recognition and transport by multi drug resistance protein 1 (ABCC1), FEBS letters 2006, 580 (4), pp. 1103-1111 .)     [0011]    Diese indirekte Analyse der Transporteraktivitt des ABCC1-Transporters kann zur Diagnose/Prdiagnose einer entsprechenden Krankheit genutzt werden. Bei Probanden, welche bereits auf anderen Wegen ABCC1-transportable Substanzen zu sich nehmen, kann das Profil der Wirkstoffkonzentration in Krperflssigkeiten, vorzugsweise Blutplasma, -serum und/oder Nervenwasser, untersucht werden. Eine zeitabhngige Messung zeigt fr Probanden, bei welchen eine verminderte ABCC1-Transporteraktivitt gegenber gesunden Probanden vorliegt, eine verzgerte bzw. verschobene Substanz-Konzentrationskurve (Konzentration c ber Zeit t aufgetragen), d.h. das Maximum der Kurve tritt zeitlich verndert auf.     [0012]    Wenn sich eine verschobene Kurve gegenber dem gesunden Fall ergibt, ist dies ein Anzeichen fr eine vernderte ABCC1-Transportaktivitt. Dies bedeutet, dass dann auch Substanzen wie A oder -Synuclein schlechter transportiert werden und ist so-mit ein Anzeichen fr eine entsprechende Erkrankung.     [0013]    Sowohl die Mausmodelle als auch die pharmakologische Beeinflussung des ABCC1 zeigen, dass dieser ein wichtiger zellulrer Transmembrantransporter fr das A-Protein ist und implizieren, dass die Blut-Hirn-Schranke und der Plexus choroideus eine Schlsselposition fr die A-Ausscheidung aus dem Gehirn einnehmen. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die selektive pharmakologische Aktivierung des ABCC1-Transporters die zerebrale Belastung mit A signifikant verringert und so therapeutisch zur Behandlung von Erkrankungen mit gestrter Hirn-Proteostase verwendbar ist. Weiterhin kann die Analyse der Transporteraktivitt des ABCC1-Transporters wie oben beschrieben zur indirekten oder direkten Diagnose/Prdiagnose einer entsprechenden Krankheit genutzt werden. Die direkte Analyse wre ber die Verabreichung von Substanzen, welche ber den ABCC1-Transporter transportiert werden, und deren Bestimmung, mglich. Die indirekte Analyse wurde bereits weiter oben erlutert.     [0014]    Vernderungen von Exportmechanismen, welche in Zusammenhang mit ABC-Transportern stehen, knnen das temporale Aggregationsprofil von A und anderen Hirnproteinen substantiell beeinflussen. Demzufolge wirkt sich eine Beeinflussung der Funktion des ABCC1-Transporters auf das Risiko an neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen, insbesondere an Alzheimer, zu erkranken positiv aus. ""Behandlung neurodegenerativer Erkrankungen"" umfasst in diesem Sinne die Prophylaxe als auch die Behandlung bereits bestehender Erkrankungen.     [0015]    Die Rolle der ABC-Transporter bei der A-Ausscheidung wurde zuerst derart untersucht, dass nachgewiesen wurde, dass ABCC1 in der Lage ist, A zu transportieren. Hierzu wurdenin vitroTranswell-Assays mit Endothelzellen (endothelialcelltranswellassay, ECTA) von primren, kultivierten, Kapillarendothelzellen aus Mausgehirnen verwendet (Zellkulturansatz):Primre Kulturen von Endothelzellen aus Gehirnkapillaren von ABCB1-defizienten, ABCC1-defizienten (knock out) Musen und von Kontrollmusen (C57BI/6, FVB/N) wurden genutzt, um die A-spezifische Transportaktivitt zu untersuchen. Der Transport von A aus dem abluminalen (Gehirn) in das luminale(Blut)-Kompartment ist bei ABCB1-defizienten und ABCC1-defizienten Endothelien beeintrchtigt. Die mittlere A-Transportrate whrend der ersten sechs Stunden nach Gabe von A-Peptiden (A42) betrug 2,2pg/min fr die Kontrollzellen. Im Gegensatz dazu erreichten die ABCC1-defizienten Zellen nur die halbe Transportkapazitt (1,0pg/min). In den ABCB1-defizienten Zellen war der A-Transport nahezu nicht vorhanden (0,3pg/min). Weitere Untersuchungen an Kapillarendothelien und Zellen aus dem Plexus choroideus ergaben, dass der Transporter ABCB1 stark in Gehirnkapillarendothelien exprimiert wird, wohingegen die endotheliale ABCC1-Expression in Hirnkapillaren geringer ist.    [0016]    Anhand neu generierter ABC-Transporter-defizienter Alzheimer Mausmodelle wurde dann die relative Signifikanz von Mitgliedern der ABC-Transporterfamiliein vivountersucht. Die gentechnisch vernderten Muse weisen jeweils eine Defizienz (knock out) an spezifischen ABC-Transportern ABCG2, ABCB1 oder ABCC1 auf.     [0017]    Die A-Immunohistochemie von Gehirnschnitten zeigte:i) signifikante Anstiege in der kortikalen Anzahl und der Gre A-positiver Plaques in ABCC1-defizienten Musen verglichen zu Kontrollmusen (siehe Fig. 1 und 2a-c ).ii) ABCB1-defizienteMuse zeigten einen geringeren Anstieg der Anzahl und Gre von A-Plaques als ABCC1-defiziente Muse.iii) Zwischen Kontrollmusen und ABCG2-defizienten Musen konnte kein signifikanter Unterschied festgestellt werden ( 2a-c ).    [0018]    Zur Bestimmung der Menge an pufferlslichem A (grtenteils Monomere und kleinere Oligomere) und an Guanidin-lslichem A (grtenteils fibrillres bzw. aggregiertes Material) wurden enzymgekoppelte Immunadsorptionstests (Enzymelinkedimmunoabsorbentassays, ELISAs) fr A verwendet.     [0019]    In bereinstimmung mit den morphologischen Ergebnissen aus der Immunohistochemie zeigten die ABCC1-defizienten Muse einen signifikanten Anstieg bei aggregiertem A im Vergleich zu den Kontrollmusen zu allen Messungszeitpunkten. Die zerebrale Belastung mit A war in einem Alter von 25 Wochen am strksten. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt waren die A-Werte (A42) 12-mal hher als bei den Kontrollmusen. Pufferlsliches A stieg mit dem Alter ebenfalls an, aber nach 25 Wochen, zum Zeitpunkt der hchsten Plaques-Belastung, fielen die Werte des lslichen As in der ABCC1-defizienten Gruppe stark ab.     [0020]    Weitere Untersuchungen wurden durchgefhrt, welche weitere Belege fr den Zusammenhang zwischen dem ggf. fehlenden Abtransport durch ABCC1 und der Aggregation von A lieferten.     [0021]    Die Transportkinetiken von ABC-Transportern hngen unter anderem von spezifischen Protein-/Peptidcharakteristika wie der spezifischen Ladung ab. Die Dutch-type-Variante des Amyloid-Precursor-Proteins (hollndische Mutante, APPdt), welche eine zustzliche negative Ladung nahe der Schnittstelle der -Sekretase des APP einfhrt und so zu einer schweren, zerebralen Amyloidangiopathie (CAA) fhrt, beeinflusst die Eliminierung des Adtber die Blut-Hirn-Schranke. Die Western-blot-Analysen von Gehirnkapillaren und Plexuschoroideus (CP) aus Kontrollmusen zeigten eine starke Expression von ABCB1 in zerebralen Kapillarendothelien (BC) und von ABCC1 im CP ( Fig. 3d ). Da ABC-Transporter eine wichtige Rolle bei der Eliminierung des A spielen, wurde angenommen, dass ABC-Transporter-defiziente (an der Blut-Hirn-Schranke und an der Blut-Plexuschoroideus-Schranke) APPdt-transgene Muse eine verstrkte Akkumulation von Adtin meningealen Gefen aufweisen. Der Grad der CAA in den ABCdefizienten APPdt-Musen wurde im Alter von 24 Monaten quantifiziert. In bereinstimmung mit der Annahme waren mindestens 51% der Gefe schwer beeintrchtigt (>75% der Gefwand mit A beladen) bei den ABCC1-defizienten Tieren gegenber 23% bei den Kontrollen ( Fig. 3c ).     [0022]    Auf Basis dieser Ergebnisse wurde untersucht, inwieweit der Gehalt an lslichem A im Gehirn durch wirkstoffvermittelte Aktivierung von ABC-Transportern verringert/beeinflusst werden konnte. Muse mit Amyloidablagerungen wurden fr 30 Tage mit dem anti-emetischen Thiethylperazin (Torecan<>,2-(Ethylthio)-10-[3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl]-10H-phenothiazin) behandelt. Zweimal tglich wurden 3mg/kg Krpergewicht intramuskulr verabreicht. Die prophylaktische Behandlung begann bereits bevor die Muse senile Plaques ausbildeten. ELISA-Messungen der behandelten Tiere zeigten eine Reduktion der A-Menge von mindestens 31% bei den behandelten Musen im Vergleich zu mit Vehikel-behandelten Tieren (Vehikel = Wasser) ( Fig. 3e ). Die Ergebnisse sind graphisch in Fig. 3 wiedergegeben.     [0023]    Die Fhigkeit zur Entfernung von A erwies sich als ein Schlsselfaktor bei der Regulation der intrazerebralen Akkumulation von A.     [0024]    Als besonders effizienter Aktivator des ABCC1-Transporters erwies sich Thiethylperazin (Torecan<>). Weitere Derivate ausgehend vom selben Grundgerst zeigten ebenfalls gute Ergebnisse bei der Aktivierung des ABCC1-Transporters. Die entsprechenden Derivate sind in der allgemeinen Formel I dargestellt<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""395582111-ib0002"" />wobei die ResteR<1> und R<2> gleich oder verschieden sind und jeweils unabhngig voneinander C1 -C6 -Alkylgruppen sind, welche unabhngig voneinander gegebenenfalls einen weiteren Substituenten ausgewhlt aus Alkyl-, Aryl-, Acyl-(vorzugsweise Acetyl-), Amino-, Nitro-, Sulfonyl-, Hydroxyl-, Alkoxy-, Aryloxy-, Arylthio-, Alkylthio-Gruppe und Halogenatom aufweisen, wobei die jeweiligen Alkylgruppen gegebenenfalls mindestens ein weiteres Halogenatom aufweisen und der RestR<3> sich an einer der Positionen 6-9 des Phenothiazin-Ringsystems, vorzugsweise an Position 6, 7 oder 8, befindet und ein Wasserstoffatom oder eine Alkyl-, Aryl-, Acyl-(vorzugsweise Acetyl-), Amino-, Nitro-, Sulfonyl-, Hydroxyl-, Alkoxy-, Aryloxy-, Arylthio- oder Alkylthio-Gruppe oder ein Halogenatomist, wobei die jeweiligen Alkylgruppen gegebenenfalls mindestens ein weiteres Halogenatom aufweisen,oder eine NR<4> R<5> - oder OR<6> -Gruppe ist, wobei R<4> , R<5> und R<6> gleich oder verschieden sind und jeweils unabhngig voneinander ausgewhlt sind aus Wasserstoff und C1 -C3 -Alkylgruppe und der RestR<7> sich an einer der Positionen 1, 2 oder 4 des Phenothiazin-Ringsystems, vorzugsweise an Position 2 oder 4, befindet und ein Wasserstoffatom oder eine Alkyl-, Aryl-, Acyl-(vorzugsweise Acetyl-), Amino-, Nitro-, Sulfonyl-, Hydroxyl-, Alkoxy-, Aryloxy-, Arylthio- oder Alkylthio-Gruppe oder ein Halogenatom ist, wobei die jeweiligen Alkylgruppen gegebenenfalls mindestens ein weiteres Halogenatom aufweisen, oder eine NR<8> R<9> - oder OR<10> -Gruppe ist, wobei R<8> , R<9> und R<10> gleich oder verschieden sind und jeweils unabhngig voneinander ausgewhlt sind aus Wasserstoff und C1 -C3 -Alkylgruppe.    [0025]    Diese Derivate sind entsprechend gut geeignet zur Behandlung neurodegenerativer Erkrankungen, insbesondere von -Amyloidopathien oder -Synucleinopathien, wobei Behandlung wie oben erwhnt sowohl die Prophylaxe als auch die Behandlung bereits bestehender Erkrankungen umfasst. Das Halogenatom/die Halogenatome sind vorzugsweise ausgewhlt aus Fluor und Chlor. Die Acylgruppen (-(C=O)-R) der Reste R<1, 2, 3, 7>sind vorzugsweise Acetylgruppen (-C(=O)CH3). Vorzugsweise sind die Reste R<1>und R<2>gleich oder verschieden und jeweils unabhngig voneinander eine C1-C6-Alkylgruppe oder eine C1-C6-Alkylgruppe (bevorzugt C1-Alkyl), substituiert mit einer Acetylgruppe, sowie die Reste R<3>und R<7>Wasserstoff oder eine Acetylgruppe. In einer bevorzugten Ausfhrungsform sind die Reste R<1>und R<2>gleich oder verschieden und jeweils unabhngig voneinander eine C1-C3-Alkylgruppe. Weiterhin ist es bevorzugt, dass die Reste R<3>und R<7>Wasserstoff sind. Besonders bevorzugt ist es, wenn der Rest R<1>eine Methylgruppe, der Rest R<2>eine Ethylgruppe und die Reste R<3>und R<7>Wasserstoff sind (Thiethylperazin, Torecan<>). Bei der Verwendung zur Behandlung neurodegenerativer Erkrankungen hat es sich als vorteilhaft erwiesen, den 2-(R<2>-Thio)-10-[3-(4-R<1>-piperazin-1-yl)propyl]-10H-phenothiazinen weitere Wirkstoffe, vorzugsweise 1-Benzhydrylpiperazine, hchst bevorzugt1-Benzhydryl-4-cinnamyl-piperazin (Cinnarizin), zuzusetzen.     [0026]    Verschiedene neurodegenerative Erkrankungen knnen mit den erfindungsgemen 2-(R<2>-Thio)-10-[3-(4-R<1>-piperazin-1-yl)propyl]-10H-phenothiazin-Derivaten behandelt werden oder sind mittels der oben beschriebenen indirekten Analyse diagnostizierbar. In einer besonders bevorzugten Ausfhrungsform ist die neurodegenerative Erkrankung eine -Amyloidopathie, insbesondere Alzheimer Demenz (AD).Eine andere Ausfhrungsform betrifft den Fall, dass die neurodegenerative Erkrankung eine -Synucleinopathie, insbesondere Parkinson'sche Erkrankung (PD) ist. Beide Erkrankungen, d.h. -Amyloidopathie und -Synucleinopathien, sind durch zerebrale Proteinablagerungen charakterisiert, welche anhand einer Aktivierung des ABCC1-Transporters behandelt oder anhand dessen Aktivitt diagnostiziert werden knnen.     [0027]    Andere, ebenfalls ber Aktivierung des ABCC1-Transporters behandelbare oder anhand der ABCC1-Transporteraktivitt diagnostizierbare Erkrankungen, sind nachfolgend genannt. So ist eine weitere, behandelbare Erkrankung die Lewy-Krperchen-Demenz (LBD). Diese ist ebenfalls durch eine zerebrale Proteinaggregation gekennzeichnet, d.h. ist eine -Synucleinopathie wie Parkinson.     [0028]    Eine andere Ausfhrungsform betrifft den Fall, dass die neurodegenerative Erkrankung die Huntington'sche Erkrankung (HD) ist. Eine andere Ausfhrungsform betrifft den Fall, dass die neurodegenerative Erkrankung eine Prion-Erkrankung, insbesondere Creutzfeld-Jacob-Erkrankung (CJD) oder Fatale Familire Insomnie (FFI), ist. Eine andere Ausfhrungsform betrifft den Fall, dass die neurodegenerative Erkrankung eine Tauopathie, insbesondere Cortico-Basale-Degeneration (CBD), Steel-Richardson-Olszewski-Syndrom (PSP, progessivesupranuclearpalsy- progressive supranuklere Blickparese) oder Pick'sche Erkrankung (PiD), ist. Eine andere Ausfhrungsform betrifft den Fall, dass die neurodegenerative Erkrankung eine Frontotemporale Degeneration (FTLD), insbesondere Ubiquitin-positive Degeneration, TDP43-positive Degeneration oder fr Ubiquitin- und TDP43-negative Degenerationen, ist. Eine andere Ausfhrungsform betrifft den Fall, dass die neurodegenerative Erkrankung amyotrophe Lateralsklerose (ALS) ist. Eine andere Ausfhrungsform betrifft den Fall, dass die neurodegenerative Erkrankung eine spinozerebellre Ataxie (SCA) oder spastische Paraparese (SPG) ist. Eine andere Ausfhrungsform betrifft den Fall, dass die neurodegenerative/neuroimmunologische Erkrankung Multiple Sklerose (MS) oder ein MS-verwandtes Syndrom, insbesondere ADEM oder Devic-Syndrom, ist.      Beschreibung der Abbildungen     [0029]    Es zeigenAbb. 1a : dass die kortikale Dichte neuritischer Plaques bei ABCC1-defizienten Musen (ABCC1ko) um 75% erhht ist;Abb. 1b,c : dass die mittlere Plaquegre erhht ist (+34%) aufgrund der greren Anzahl an Plaques (+63%) mit einer Gre von mehr als 700m<2> und einer geringeren Hufigkeit kleinerer Plaques (-24%). Fehlerbalken, Standardfehler (n3);Abb. 1d : dass die IHC-Frbung bei ABCG2-defizienten(ABCG2ko)-, ABCB1-defizienten-(ABCB1ko)-, ABCC1-defizienten (ABCC1ko)-Musen und bei Kontroll-Musen eine hhere Flchendichte an Abei ABCC1-defizienten Tieren zeigt. Typische Plaques derselben Gre sind im Ausschnitt dargestellt, Skalierungsbalken stellen 500m (bersicht) und 50m (Ausschnitt) dar (*p<0,05);Abb.2a : dass die Plaquedichte im Kortex (Bedeckung) und die Gre bei spezifischen ABC-Transporter-knockout-Musen erhht ist. Insbesondere ABCC1-defiziente (ABCC1ko)Muse zeigen eine erhhte A-Amyloidbelastung (hellgraue Balken, jeweils rechts auen in den einzelnen Gruppierungen), w = Woche auf der Abszisse;Abb. 2b : dass die Gesamtplaquegre bei ABCC1-defizienten (ABCC1ko) und ABCB1-defizienten (ABCB1ko)Musen im Alter von 25 Wochen erhht ist, w = Woche auf der Abszisse;Abb. 2c : dass der Gesamtanstieg in der Plaquegre mit dem Auftreten weniger kleiner Plaques und mehr grerer Plaques (>700 m<2> ) assoziiert ist, wohingegen die Anzahl mittelgroer Plaques auf dem selben Wert bleibt, Fehlerbalken, Standardfehler (n5), *p<0,05;Abb. 3 : dass die Defizienz von ABCC1 die Akkumulierung von A und Adt frdert und dass die Aktivierung von ABCC1 (durch Gabe von Torecan) die A-Werte senkt; wobeiAbb. 3a : zeigt, dass in einem Alter von 25 Wochen ABCC1-Defizienz zu einem markanten Anstieg (12fach) bei unlslichem A fhrt; undAbb.3b : zeigt, dass die Menge an pufferlslichem A42 in einem Alter von 25 Wochen merklich reduziert ist im Vergleich zu 22 Wochen (-56%). Dies beruht wahrscheinlich auf der Ablagerung in unlslichen Depots. Im selben Alter ist die von A-Ablagerungen belegte Flche, welche in der Immunohistochemie gemessen wird, um 83% erhht (Fehlerbalken Standardfehler n5, p<0,05);Abb. 3c : zeigt, dass 53% der Blutgefe schwer durch CAA beeintrchtigt sind (>75% der Gefwnde weisen A auf). Dies betrifft ABCC1-defiziente Muse (ABCC1ko) im Vergleich zu 23% bei den Kontrollen (n=3);Abb. 3d : zeigt, dass die Expression von ABCC1 predominant im Plexus choroideus (CP) zu sehen ist, wohingegen ABCB1 hauptschlich in den Kapillaren des Gehirns (BP) exprimiert ist;Abb. 3 e : zeigt, dass die Aktivierung von ABCC1 durch Thiethylperazin (Torecan) die A-Werte bei Musen senkt (-28%), Fehlerbalken, Standardfehler (n=4, *p<0,05).     Beispiele      Tiere     [0030]    APP-transgene Muse (APP, APPdt) wurden von The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, USA) und der Universitt Tbingen (Tbingen, Deutschland) bezogen. Die NEPdefizienten Muse wurden vom Riken Brain Research Institute (Saitama, Japan) bezogen. ABCG2-, ABCB1-, und ABCC1-defiziente Muse wurden von Taconic-Farms (Dnemark) bezogen. Alle transgenen und knockout Mauslinien wurden fr mindestens 9 Generationen in den genetischen FVB-Hintergrund eingekreuzt. Die Muse wurden in 12h/12h Licht/Dunkelheit-Zyklus bei 23C gehalten mit freiem Zugang zu Nahrung und Wasser.      Methoden     Gewebeprparation    [0031]    Zur Gewebeprparation wurden die Muse durch zervikale Dislokation gettet und transkardial mit PBS (Phosphat-gepufferte, physiologische Kochsalzlsung) perfusioniert. Das Gehirn wurde entfernt und eine Hemisphre in gepuffertem, 4%-igem Paraformaldehyd fr Parafineinbettung und Immunohistochemie gelagert. Die andere Hemisphre wurde in flssigem Stickstoff schockgefroren und bei -80C fr biochemische Analysen gelagert.     ELISA    [0032]    ELISA-Kits (TH40HS, TK42HS) von The Genetics Company (TGC, Schlieren, Schweiz) wurden fr die Quantifizierung von A verwendet. Gehirnhemisphren wurden unter Verwendung von PreCellys24 (12 s, 6.500 rpm) homogenisiert. Nach Zusatz von Carbonatpuffer (pH 8,0) wurden die Homogenisate unter Verwendung von PreCellys gemischt (5 s, 5.000 rpm) und 90 min zentrifugiert bei 4C und 24.000 g, um unlsliche von lslichen A-Spezies zu trennen. Der verbleibende berstand (pufferlsliche Fraktion) wurde mit 8M Guanidinhydrochlorid in einem Verhltnis von 1:1,6 gemischt. Zur Extraktion der aggregierten A-Spezies wurde das Pellet in 8 Volumen von 5M Guanidinhydrochlorid gelst, bei Raumtemperatur 3h geschttelt und bei 24.000 g fr 20 min bei 4C zentrifugiert. Der verbleibende berstand stellte die Guanidin-lsliche Fraktion dar (GuaHCl). Proteingehalte aller Proben wurden dreifach gemessen, wobei ein Nanodrop1000 Spektrophotometer verwendet wurde (ThermoFisher Scientific, Wilmington, USA). Die ELISAs wurden gem Herstelleranweisung unter Verwendung passender Verdnnungen durchgefhrt.     Western Blots    [0033]    Fr die WesternBlots wurden Gewebehomogenisate hergestellt. Die Gesamtproteinkonzentrationen der Extrakte wurden unter Verwendung eines BCA-Assays bestimmt (Pierce, Teil von Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, USA). Nach der Elektrophorese von 10 g Gesamtprotein pro Spur wurden die Proteine auf PVDF-Membranen geblottet. Nach Blockade in 5% Trockenmilch in TBST-Puffer (50 mMTris pH 7,4, 150 mMNaCl, 0,1% Tween20) fr 1h bei Raumtemperatur, wurden die Blots entweder auf ABCB1 (1:500, D-11, Santa Cruz), ABCC1 (1:200, Alexis Bio) oder -Actin (1:20.000, Sigma) ber Nacht bei 4C untersucht. Als Detektionsantikrper wurden Anti-Maus-HRP, Anti-Ratte-HRP bzw. Anti-Hase-HRP verwendet. Fr die Visualisierung wurden ein Amersham ECL Plus Detektionskit und eine RoperCoolSnap HQ<2>-Kamera verwendet.     Immunohistochemie (IHC)    [0034]    Formalin-fixierte Gehirne wurden in Paraffin eingebettet und in 4m-dicke Sektionen geschnitten. Nach Entfernung des Paraffins wurden die Sektionen mit einem Bond-Max Autostainer (Menarini/Leica, Deutschland) weiter behandelt. Immunofrbung wurde initiert nach Blockade endogener Peroxidase (5 min) und Epitop-Wiederfindung (epitoperetrieval) fr 5 min mit 95% Ameisensure (fr Antikrper 6F3D, Dako, Deutschland) und 70% Ameisensure (fr Antikrper 4G8, Millipore, Deutschland). Primre Antikrper wurden routinemig bei Raumtemperatur fr 30 min mit folgenden Verdnnungen inkubiert: 6F3D (1:100), 4G8 (1:500). Primre Antikrper wurden mit dem BondMax Bond Polymer Refine-Detektionskit und nach dem Standardprotokoll DAB R30 detektiert. Die Schnitte wurden vollstndig digitalisiert mit einer Auflsung von 230nm unter Verwendung eines MiraxDesk/MiraxMidi-Scanners und anschlieend automatisch analysiert unter Verwendung des AxioVision-Softwarepakets (Zeiss, Deutschland).     Bewertung des Schweregrades der CAA    [0035]    Gehirnschnitte von APPdt-Musen wurden mit 4G8-Antikrper angefrbt. Zumindest zwei nicht aufeinander folgende Sektionen wurden auf CAA der Hirnhautgefe in verblindeter Weise untersucht. Alle Hirnhautgefe wurden manuell gezhlt und der Schweregrad der CAA wurde wie folgt kategorisiert:Kategorie I: nicht beeintrchtigtKategorie II: 25% der Peripherie positiv eingefrbtKategorie III: 50% der Peripherie positiv eingefrbtKategorie IV: 75% der Peripherie positiv eingefrbtKategorie V: 100% der Peripherie positiv eingefrbtDie mittlere Anzahl an Gefen zu jeder Kategorie wurde relativ zur Gesamtzahl aufgefundener Gefe kalkuliert.     Endothelzellen-Transwell-Assay (ECTA)    [0036]    Endothelzellen von Mausgehirnkapillaren wurden wie bei Coisneet al.beschrieben hergestellt ( Coisne, C. et al.Mouse syngenicin vitro blood-brain barrier model: a new tool to examine inflammatory events in zerebral endothelium. Laboratory Investigation; 85, 734-746 (2005 )). Mindestens zehn 3-4 Wochen alte Muse wurden enthauptet und die Gehirne entfernt. Nach Dissektion des Hirnstamms, der weien Substanz und der Hirnhaut wurde das Gewebe in zwei Volumen Waschpuffer B homogenisiert (WBB) (Hanks bufferedsaltsolution (HBBS), 10 mM HEPES, 0,1% BSA) unter Verwendung eines 15 ml Glassdouncers (Wheaton Industries, Millville, NJ; USA). Ein Volumen von 30% Dextranlsung wurde dem Homogenisat zugegeben. Es wurde zweimal bei 3.000 g und 4C zentrifugiert. Das Pellet, welches die Gefe enthielt, wurde in WBB resuspendiert und groe Gefe wurden manuell durch harsches Pipettieren der Lsung aufgebrochen. Vakuumfiltration durch 60 m-Membranen (SEFAR, Schweiz) wurde eingesetzt um groe Gefe von den Kapillaren zu trennen. Nach kombinierter Behandlung mit Kollagenase/Dispase (HBSS, 10 mM HEPES, 0,15 g/ml TCLK, 10 g/ml DNAse-l, 1 mg/ml Kollagenase/Dispase (Roche) wurde Einzelzellsuspension durch weiteres harsches Pipettieren der Lsung erreicht. Endothelzellen wurden in Matrigelbeschichtete Transwellinserts eingebracht (0,4 m Poren, Greiner Bio-One, Deutschland) mit einer Dichte von 120.000 Zellen pro Insert und wachsen gelassen auf einer untersttzenden Glialkultur.Schwefelgelb wurde zur Bestimmung des parazellulren Flusses whrend der Assays verwendet. Das Kulturmedium des abluminalen Kompartments wurde ersetzt mit einer Lsung, welche 10 ng A42 enthielt (1,6 nM Endkonzentration). Anschlieend wurden Proben aus dem luminalen Kompartment nach 2h, 6h bzw. 24h entnommen und der A-Gehalt wurde mit ELISA bestimmt (TK42-highsense, TGC, Schweiz). Die Transportrate wurde wie bei Coisneet al. beschrieben bestimmt ( Coisne, C. et al. Mouse syngenic in vitro blood-brain barrier model: a new tool to examine inflammatory events in cerebral endothelium. Laboratory Investigation; 85, 734-746 (2005 )).     ELISA-Statistiken    [0037]    Der Lilliefors-godness-of-fit-Test (alpha=0,05) wurde auf die ELISA-Daten und auf die log-transformierten ELISA-Daten angewandt, um zwischen der Annahme von normal verteilten Probendaten und der Annahme log-normal verteilter Probendaten zu unterscheiden. Trotz der geringen Probengre wurde fr beiden Datenstze die Nullhypothese (H0) abgelehnt fr 5 von 44 Proben. In bereinstimmung mit der Beobachtung berwiegend positiven Versatzes (skew) und strikt positiver Probendaten wurde die Annahme normal verteilter Daten verworfen. Mittelwerte und Konfidenzintervalle wurden unter der Annahme einer zugrunde liegenden log-normal Verteilung berechnet. Der Wilcoxon-Rank-sum-Test wurde angewandt, um die ELISA-Daten der verschiedenen Mausstmme fr jeden Zeitpunkt zu vergleichen. ",,,,,"EPF16180106 A(Patent of invention)

Background Art     [0002]    Along with the trend toward lightweight and small size for digital devices, more and more portable devices have been used. Therefore, users can readily execute intended tasks using portable devices at any time in any place. For example, banking service is available irrespective of time and place and contact is easily made between users through portable devices.     [0003]    FIG. 1 illustrates an example of banking service in a conventional portable device.     [0004]    Referring to FIG. 1 , when a user intends to use the banking service through a portable device 10, the user should enter a certificate password. Because the certificate password needs security, its contents are not displayed, with a security indication 11 to prevent other people from viewing the certificate password. Therefore, a certain level of security is guaranteed during banking on the portable device 10.     [0005]    However, when the user enters the certificate password, a specific key that the user is currently entering is enlarged on a keypad 12, as illustrated in FIG. 1 . Once someone near to the user makes up his or her mind to find out the password, the user's password is easily known.     [0006]    A Head Mount Display (HMD) refers to any image display apparatus wearable on a head like glasses, for displaying an image. The HMD is a kind of wearable computer that enables only a user to view displayed information. Accordingly, the user's privacy is readily protected since the information is not exposed to people around the user.     [0007]    The HMD can be used in conjunction with various external devices. The HMD is connected to an external device through a network and thus can output content received from the external. Furthermore, the HMD can receive a user input to the external device or perform an operation in interaction with the external device.      Disclosure of Invention      Technical Problem     [0008]    An object of the present invention devised to solve the problem lies on a method for, when personal data is to be displayed on an external device, displaying the personal data on a Head Mount Display (HMD) to prevent exposure of the personal data to people around a user.     [0009]    Another object of the present invention devised to solve the problem lies on a method for displaying on an HMD only a component requiring protection in content displayed on an external device.     [0010]    Another object of the present invention devised to solve the problem lies on a method for displaying data requiring protection from an external device on an HMD, while applying a protection layer to the data on the external device so that the data cannot be viewed     [0011]    A further object of the present invention devised to solve the problem lies on a tactile feedback in regard to a component to which a protection layer is applied for data protection in an external device.      Solution to Problem     [0012]    The object of the present invention can be achieved by providing a method for controlling an HMD, which includes detecting an external device in an image captured by the HMD, recognizing at least one component from a first User Interface (UI) of the external device, the at least one component including a keypad or a window for outputting data corresponding to an input signal to the keypad, generating a second UI including the recognized at least one component, displaying the second UI in the HMD, wherein the at least one component of the first UI being displayed on the external device is overlaid with the displayed second UI using the image from which the external device is detected, and displaying data corresponding to an input signal currently received at the external device on the second UI in the HMD.     [0013]    In another aspect of the present invention, provided herein is an HMD including a processor configured to control an operation of the HMD, a display unit configured to output an image, a communication unit configured to transmit and receive data to and from an external device, and a sensor unit configured to capture an image and provide the captured image to the processor. The processor is configured to detect an external device in an image captured by the HMD, recognize at least one component from a first UI of the external device, the at least one component including a keypad or a window for outputting data corresponding to an input signal to the keypad, generate a second UI including the recognized at least one component, display the second UI so that the at least one component of the first UI being displayed on the external device is overlaid with the displayed second UI, and display data corresponding to an input signal currently received at the external device on the second UI.      Advantageous Effects of Invention     [0014]    If an external device is supposed to display personal information, the personal information is displayed through an HMD, thereby preventing data leakage and enhancing security in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.     [0015]    In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, only a component requiring privacy protection among components being displayed on the external device is displayed on the HMD. Therefore, user convenience can be increased.     [0016]    In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a protection layer is provided to data displayed on the HMD for data protection so that the same data is not displayed on the external device. Therefore, a user is allowed to view data without interruptions, while data leakage through the external device is efficiently prevented.     [0017]    In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, upon receipt of a user's touch input regarding a component for which a protection layer is provided on the external device, for data protection, the external device provides a tactile feedback, thereby increasing user convenience.

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention     [0020]    Although the terms used in the present invention are selected from generally known and used terms, the terms may be changed according to the intention of an operator, customs, or the advent of new technology. Some of the terms mentioned in the description of the present invention have been selected by the applicant at his or her discretion, the detailed meanings of which are described in relevant parts of the description herein. Therefore, the present invention must be understood, not simply by the actual terms used but by the meanings of each term lying within.     [0021]    The embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings and a description in the attached drawings, which should not be construed as limiting the present invention.     [0022]    FIG. 2 illustrates a Head Mount Display (HMD), a user wearing the HMD, and an external device interacting with the HMD according to an embodiment of the present invention.     [0023]    An external device 100 according to the present invention may output various types of content 111. For example, the external device 100 may output a variety of multimedia content including live broadcasting, movies, music, soap operas, Web pages, games, applications, etc.     [0024]    The external device 100 includes at least one display unit 110 for displaying the content 111 output from the external device 100.     [0025]    The external device 100 may further include a communication unit (not shown) for transmitting data to or receiving data from an HMD 200 and other devices.     [0026]    When content displayed on the external device 100 needs protection, the displayed content may be wholly or partially transmitted to the HMD 200 according to the present invention. That is, if a UI displayed on the external device 100 includes a pre-determined component, the external device 100 may transmit necessary data to the HMD 200 so that the entire UI or the component included in the UI can be displayed on the HMD 200, which will be described later with reference to FIGS. 4 to 7 .     [0027]    Accordingly, the external device 100 may be any of various devices each including a display unit and a communication unit in the present invention. For example, the external device 100 is useful, especially when it is a portable device capable of displaying data and communicating with other devices, such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a laptop computer, a tablet PC, or the like, because privacy protection is often required for, for example, personal information when the portable device is used outdoors. This will be described in greater detail with reference to FIG. 4 .     [0028]    The HMD 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 may operate in interaction with the external device 100. For interaction, the HMD 200 may be paired with the external device 100 or establish a communication connection with the external device 100. The pairing or the communication connection establishment may be performed in response to a user input through the HMD 200 or the external device 100.     [0029]    For example, the HMD 200 may provide a button or UI for pairing with the external device 100 or establishing a communication connection with the external device 100. In addition, a user may pair the HMD 200 with the external device 100 or establish a communication connection between the HMD 200 and the external device 100 using the button or the UI.     [0030]    Once the HMD 200 is paired with the external device 100 or establishes a communication connection with the external device 100, data to be protected from the external device 100 may be displayed on the HMD 200.     [0031]    A network 20 may be any of various wired or wireless networks that enable communication between the HMD 200 and the external device 100 in the present invention. The available networks may operate in conformance to Near Field Communication (NFC), infrared communication, Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), etc. However, the present invention is not limited to a specific network.     [0032]    In the present invention, the HMD 200 may communicate with the external device 100 through one or a combination of the afore-described networks.     [0033]    FIG. 3 is a functional block diagram of the HMD according to an embodiment of the present invention. The configuration of the HMD illustrated in FIG. 3 is a mere embodiment of the present invention and thus a component may be removed from or added to the HMD within the scope of the present invention.     [0034]    Referring to FIG. 3 , an HMD 300 according to an embodiment of the present invention may include a display unit 310, a communication unit 320, a sensor unit 330, and a processor 340.     [0035]    The display unit 310 displays an image on a screen. The display unit 310 may output an image based on content executed in the processor 340 or according to a control command received from the processor 340.     [0036]    In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the display unit 310 may also display an image according to a control command received from an external device (e.g. a portable device) interacting with the HMD 300.     [0037]    For example, the display unit 310 may display content being executed in the external device interacting with the HMD 300. The content includes a UI displayed by executing a Web page or an application as well as a picture or a video. The content may include any data displayed to execute a specific function in the present invention. The HMD 300 may receive data from the external device through the communication unit 320 and output an image based on the received data.     [0038]    The communication unit 320 may transmit or receive data by communicating with the external device based on various protocols. In addition, the communication unit 320 may access a wired or wireless network and transmit or receive data such as content through the network.     [0039]    The HMD 300 may be paired or establish a communication connection with the external device through the communication unit 320 and thus may transmit data to or receive data from the connected external device in the present invention. The communication unit 320 may access a wired or wireless network and thus may transmit and receive digital data such as content, graphic data of a UI, and a control command.     [0040]    Therefore, the HMD 300 of the present invention may receive data requiring privacy protection from the external device through the communication unit 320 and display the received data on the display unit 310 in such a manner that only the user can view the data.     [0041]    The sensor unit 330 may transmit a user input or information about a HMD-perceived environment to the processor 340, using a plurality of sensors mounted to the HMD 300. The sensor unit 330 may include a plurality of sensors.     [0042]    The plurality of sensors may include a gravity sensor, a geomagnetic sensor, a motion sensor, a gyro sensor, an acceleration sensor, an infrared sensor, an inclination sensor, an ambient light sensor, an altitude sensor, an odor sensor, a temperature sensor, a depth sensor, a pressure sensor, a bending sensor, an audio sensor, a video sensor, a Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor, a touch sensor, etc. These sensors may be included as separate elements in the HMD 300 or incorporated into at least one element in the HMD 300.     [0043]    As described above, the sensor unit 330 refers to a set of various sensors. The sensor unit 330 may sense a user's various environments and provide the sensed result to the processor 340 so that the processor 340 may perform an operation corresponding to the sensed result.     [0044]    The present invention is intended to provide an environment in which a user can view data requiring privacy protection on an HMD, when the data is displayed on an external device. Especially in an embodiment of the present invention, data displayed on the external device and data displayed on the HMD may be combined into complete data to the eyes of the user. Thus the user acquires complete information.     [0045]    Accordingly, the sensor unit 330 may include a capturing sensor (not shown). The capturing sensor may capture an image. In other words, the capturing sensor may detect an image in a predetermined area corresponding to the field of the vision of the user wearing the HMD 300 and provide the detected image to the processor 340.     [0046]    The processor 340 may determine whether an external device exists in the predetermined area corresponding to the field of the vision of the user wearing the HMD 340, based on the image detected by the capturing sensor. Upon detection of the presence of an external device, the processor 340 may receive data requiring privacy protection from the external device and display the data.     [0047]    In addition, the processor 340 may recognize a component of a UI displayed on the external device in the image detected by the capturing sensor. That is, the processor 340 may recognize a component of a UI included in the detected image by image processing or the like. This will be described later with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7 .     [0048]    Whether data requires privacy protection or whether the external device is to transmit data to the HMD may be determined in a different manner according to a predetermined condition, which will be described with reference to FIG. 4 .     [0049]    The processor 340 may process data within the HDM 300, control each unit of the HMD 300, and control data transmission and reception between units of the HDM 300.     [0050]    While not shown in FIG. 3 , the HDM 300 may include a storage unit, an audio Input/ Output (I/O) unit, or a power unit.     [0051]    The storage unit (not shown) may store various digital data like an audio, a photo, a video, and an application. The storage unit refers to a variety of digital data storage spaces such as a flash memory, a Random Access Memory (RAM), a Solid State Drive (SSD), etc.     [0052]    The storage unit may temporarily store data received from the external device through the communication unit 320. The storage unit may be used for buffering data or content received from the external device and outputting the buffered data or content through the HMD 300. In the present invention, it is optional to include the storage unit in the HMD 300.     [0053]    The audio output unit (not shown) includes audio output means such as a speaker, an earphone, etc. In addition, the audio output unit may output voice based on content executed in the processor 340 or in response to a control command received from the processor 340. In the present invention, it is optional to include the audio output unit in the HMD 300.     [0054]    The power unit is a power source connected to an internal battery or an external power source, for supplying power to the HMD 300.     [0055]    The block diagram of the HMD 300 illustrated in FIG. 3 is purely exemplary. Blocks shown in FIG. 3 as separately configured are logically separated elements. Accordingly, the above-described elements may be installed on one or more chips depending on a device design.     [0056]    The present invention provides a method for, when a user displays information requiring privacy protection on an external device, displaying the information on an HMD in such a manner that the information is not exposed to the outside. This method will be described below with reference to FIGS. 4 to 7 .     [0057]    FIG. 4 illustrates an embodiment of displaying a UI on the external device according to the present invention.     [0058]    The HMD may detect the presence or absence of an external device interacting with the HMD in a predetermined area corresponding to the field of the vision of a user wearing the HMD using an image captured by the sensor unit. That is, the HMD may detect an image of a predetermined external device in a captured image by image processing or the like.     [0059]    Besides, the HMD may detect the external device interacting with the HMD using position information about the HMD and position information about the external device or by the infrared sensor of the HMD.     [0060]    A detected external device 400 may display a UI 410. The UI 410 is an interface provided to the user, in relation to an application, Web page, etc. being executed in the external device 400.     [0061]    The UI 400 may include at least one component. As illustrated in FIG. 4 , the at least one component may include a keypad 411 and a window 413 for outputting data corresponding to an input signal to the keypad 411.     [0062]    When data requiring security such as a user Identifier (ID), a password, etc. is displayed on the UI 410 in the external device 400, there is a risk of exposing the data to the outside during inputting the data. In other words, despite security processing for the window 413, input data may be exposed to people around the user while the user is inputting data to the keypad 411 and thus the user risks data exposure.     [0063]    In this context, normal mode and protection mode are defined for an external device and if the external device is placed in the protection mode, data requiring security is displayed only on the HMD in the present invention. Mode switching may be performed for the external device in various manners. An embodiment of switching the mode of an external device will first be described below.     [0064]    In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the external device displays a mode switching icon 420 so that its mode may be switched according to a user input. That is, upon receipt of a user input requesting data protection from the user, for example, upon touch of the icon 420, the external device may switch to the protection mode.     [0065]    In another embodiment of the present invention, the external device may extract attribute information about content being displayed on the external device and may switch to another mode according to the extracted attribute information. The content may include any data displayable on the external device as well as a photo and a video. The attribute information about the content may be pre-stored in the storage unit of the external device. Further, the attribute information about the content may include information indicating whether data protection is needed. This attribute information may be set by the user.     [0066]    For example, if user confirmation or user authentication is needed for content such as a Web page requiring membership or log-in, an application requiring user confirmation, or image data in locked state, data protection may be set beforehand in the attribute information and stored along with the type of the content. Thus, the external device may switch its mode based on attribute information about content, referring to the storage unit, while executing the content.     [0067]    In another embodiment of the present invention, when the external device displays a preset UI, the external device may switch from the normal mode to the protection mode. The preset UI includes at least one component of a keypad, a window that outputs data corresponding to an input signal to the keypad, and a window that outputs a user's personal information.     [0068]    In this manner, the external device may switch from the normal mode to the protection mode, simultaneously with displaying a preset UI. In addition, the external device may indicate that it is operating in the protection mode by means of a protection mode icon 420 illustrated in FIG. 4 .     [0069]    As described above, the external device may switch from one mode to another according to a predetermined condition. However, if the external device has been paired with the HMD, the HMD may control mode switching of the external device according to the predetermined condition. Therefore, either the external device or the HMD may be responsible for switching the mode of the external device in the above embodiments of the present invention.     [0070]    In a further embodiment of the present invention, the HMD may determine whether the user is wearing the HMD. Upon detection of the user's wearing of the HMD, the HMD may switch the external device from the normal mode to the protection mode. The HMD may determine whether the user wears the HMD through the sensor unit including the touch sensor, the capturing sensor, etc. The user's wearing of the HMD may imply that the user intends to view personal information through the HMD and thus the HMD may switch the external device to the protection mode.     [0071]    Instead of controlling mode switching for the external device, the HMD may transmit a signal requesting switching to the protection mode to the external device so that the external device may switch to the protection mode.     [0072]    The external device may switch its mode in various manners, not limited to the above-described embodiments. As described before, the entity responsible for switching the mode of the external device may be the external device or the HMD.     [0073]    When the external device switches from the normal mode to the protection mode, the HMD may recognize at least one component in a UI displayed on the external device. The HMD may also generate a UI including the recognized at least one component and display the UI. For convenience' sake of description, the UI provided by the external device and the UI provided by the HMD will be referred to as first and second UIs, respectively.     [0074]    FIG. 5 illustrates an embodiment of displaying UIs on the HMD and the external device according to the present invention. In the embodiment of the present invention, the entire first UI displayed on the external device is displayed as the second UI on the HMD.     [0075]    Referring to FIG. 5(a) , upon receipt of a user input to a preset icon 511, an external device 510 may switch to the protection mode. When the external device 510 switches from the normal mode to the protection mode, an HMD 520 may receive data related to a first UI 513 from the external device 510, generate a second UI 523 identical to the first UI 513, and display the second UI 523.     [0076]    The HMD 520 may receive data needed to generate the second UI 523 from the external device 510 and generate the second UI 523 based on the received data. Alternatively or additionally, the HMD 520 may generate the second UI 523 by recognizing the display unit or screen of the external device 510 from an image of the external device 510 captured by the sensor unit and using an image displayed on the display unit or screen or editing the image.     [0077]    Therefore, the user may view the UI 523 identical to the UI 513 provided by the external device 510 on the HMD 520.     [0078]    Notably, upon receipt of an input signal to a keypad, a window 515 being one of the components included in the first UI 513 may represent the state of the input. When the external device 510 displays data corresponding to the input signal on the window 515, the data may be exposed to other people around the external device 510. Therefore, the external device 510 subjects data displayed on the window 515 to security processing so that only the input state is displayed on the window 515 and thus other people around the external device 510 may not view the contents of the data.     [0079]    On the other hand, since only the user wearing the HMD 520 can view a component 525 included in the second UI 523, that is, a window 525 on which data corresponding to an input to the keypad is output, the data is not subjected to security processing and thus the input state and input data can be displayed.     [0080]    The user can view all necessary data on the second UI 523. Therefore, the external device 510 may display a protection layer over the displayed area of the first UI 513 to prevent information exposure to people around the external device 510. The protection layer is a layer displayed over the first UI 513, which makes data displayed on the first UI 513 unseen or unidentifiable. This will be described with reference to FIGS. 8 , 9 and 10 .     [0081]    FIG. 6 illustrates another embodiment of displaying UIs on the HMD and the external device according to the present invention. The second UI of the HMD is the same as the first UI of the external device in the afore-described embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the second UI of the HMD includes only a part of the components of the first UI of the external device.     [0082]    Referring to FIG. 6 , a first UI 611 provided by an external device 610 may include at least one component. An HMD 620 can recognize only a certain component in the first UI 611. The recognized component may include a keypad 613 or a window that outputs data corresponding to an input signal to the keypad 613. As illustrated in FIG. 6 , the HMD 620 recognizes the keypad 613 in the first UI and generates a second UI 621 with the recognized keypad 613.     [0083]    Now a description will be given of an embodiment of recognizing a component of the first UI 611 in the HMD 620. The external device 610 may store data related to at least one component included in the first UI 611 in the storage unit or receive the data from an external server. The external device 610 may transmit the stored or received data related to the at least one component to the HMD 620. Then the HMD 620 may recognize a component from the receive data.     [0084]    Another embodiment of recognizing a component in the first UI 611 in the HMD 620 will be described below. The HMD 620 may recognize a component in an image captured to detect the external device 610. In other words, the HMD 620 may separate an image displayed on the display unit of the external device 610 from a captured image of the external device 610 by, for example, scissoring and may recognize the type of a component in the first UI in the separated image.     [0085]    The HMD 620 may generate the second UI 621 with a pre-stored component corresponding to the recognized component. Or the HMD 620 may generate the second UI 621 by using or editing the image of the recognized component.     [0086]    The HMD 620 may display the second UI 621 so that the second UI 621 is laid over the first UI 611 being displayed on the external device 610.     [0087]    That is, the HMD 620 may recognize the display unit (or screen) of the external device 610 using an image captured to detect the external device 610. Therefore, the HMD 620 may display the second UI 621 so that the component 613 of the first UI 611 is overlaid with a component included in the second UI 621.     [0088]    The HMD 620 may consider the pupil size of the user, the eye relief of an optical system with which the second UI 621 is seen, a magnification, and a Field Of View (FOV) in laying the second UI 621 over the first UI 611.     [0089]    Therefore, the user may perceive a whole image in which the second UI 621 is combined with the first UI 611, as one interface.     [0090]    In addition, the external device 610 may display a protection layer on the component 613 of the first UI 611 overlaid with the second UI 621. The use of the protection layer advantageously reduces the risk of exposure of data output on the external device 610 to people around the user. This will be described later in greater detail with reference to FIGS. 8 , 9 and 10 .     [0091]    FIG. 7 illustrates a third embodiment of displaying UIs on the HMD and the external device according to the present invention. While only one component is recognized in the first UI and the second UI is generated with the recognized component in the second embodiment of the present invention, the second UI is generated with a plurality of components included in the first UI in the third embodiment of the present invention.     [0092]    Referring to FIG. 7(a) , upon receipt of a user input signal to a preset icon 711, an external device 710 may switch from the normal mode to the protection mode. As described before, the external device may be switched from the normal mode to the protection mode by a trigger other than the user input.     [0093]    When the external device 710 switches to the protection mode, an HMD 720 may recognize at least one component. The HMD 720 may recognize the at least one component in various manners, for example, by receiving data related to components from the external device or processing a captured image. The number of recognized components is not limited. As illustrated in FIG. 7(b) , the HMD 720 may recognize a plurality of components.     [0094]    In FIG. 7(b) , a first UI includes a keypad 715 and a window 713 for outputting data corresponding to an input signal to the keypad 715, as components. Thus, a second UI may include a keypad 723 and a window 721 for outputting data corresponding to an input signal to the keypad 721.     [0095]    One thing to note herein is that the external device 710 may display protection layers over the components 713 and 715 of the first UI overlaid with the second UI. Accordingly, the user cannot view data in the displayed areas of the protection layers. Hence, the user may view a complete UI only when the user sees the first and second UIs simultaneously, wearing the HMD 720.     [0096]    Even though other people are around the user, no data leaks from the external device. Furthermore, because the second UI lies over components of the first UI, the user can readily see the one complete UI without any special efforts, simply by seeing the first and second UIs at the same time.     [0097]    Meanwhile, the HMD 720 may display data corresponding to an input signal currently received at the external device, on a second user authentication interface.     [0098]    A user's touch input may be received through the first UI of the external device. In contrast, the second UI cannot receive a user's touch input because it is a virtual interface displayed through the HMD 720.     [0099]    In this context, the external device 710 receives a user's touch input on the first UI and the HMD 720 provides a feedback to the user's touch input on the second UI according to the present invention.     [0100]    In FIG. 7(b) , when the user touches a specific key on the keypad 715 of the external device 710, the HMD 720 may display a touched key 725 on the second UI, as a feedback indicating the touched key.     [0101]    Herein, the HMD 720 may receive data corresponding to the user's touch input from the external device 710 and display the touched key 725 as a specific key corresponding to the received data. Or the HMD 720 may determine the position of the user's touch input through the sensor unit and display the touched key 725 by recognizing the key corresponding to the determined position in the second UI. The HMD 720 may recognize the key selected by the user's touch input from an image received from the external device 710 or an image captured to detect the external device 710. The present invention is not limited to the specific methods. Rather, the selected key may be recognized in other various manners.     [0102]    Meanwhile, the external device 710 may display protection layers over components of the first UI overlaid with the second UI. The protection layers are layers displayed over the first UI to make it difficult for people around the external device to see data displayed on the first UI. Thus, the displayed areas of the protection layers may be perceived as dark screens to the user and other people.     [0103]    If a protection layer is displayed on the first UI, a problem may occur when a user's touch input is received on the first UI.     [0104]    For example, if a component over which a protection layer is displayed is a keypad, the user should be able to confirm a touched key in order to input an intended key correctly. However, when the user touches the first UI, the user may have difficulty in finding an intended key, viewing the second UI.     [0105]    That is, while the user's touch input is received on the first UI, the user may confirm the input key on the second UI 723. Due to the difference between the input interface (the first UI) and the interface displayed for inputting (the second UI), the user may feel difficulty in applying a touch input.     [0106]    Therefore, when the external device displays a protection layer, the protection layer may be displayed in various manners in order to facilitate a user's touch input in the present invention, which will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 8 .     [0107]    FIG. 8 illustrates an embodiment of displaying a protection layer over a component of a UI in the external device according to the present invention. It is assumed that a keypad is recognized as a component of the first UI in an external device 800 and a second UI is generated with the recognized keypad.     [0108]    As described before, the external device 800 may display a protection layer 810 over a component of a first UI overlaid with a second UI. If the component of the second UI includes a keypad, the protection layer 810 may include the outline of the first UI.     [0109]    Therefore, although the user cannot identify a specific key on the keypad of the first UI, the user can easily find the specific key overlaid with the second UI based on the outline. When the protection layer of the first UI includes the outline, the HMD may be highly utilized by rendering the second UI more transparent. That is, if the second UI gets more transparent, the user may see a matching outline and his or her hand that inputs a specific key and thus easily input the specific key.     [0110]    As the protection layer 810 provides the outline of the keypad, the user can easily identify a specific key from other keys, when touching the specific key on the first UI, viewing the second UI.     [0111]    When the second UI includes a keypad as a component, the first UI may provide a tactile feedback corresponding to a user's touch input to a component over which the protection layer 810 is displayed. Therefore, the external device may include a sensor unit for detecting a touch input and a tactile feedback unit for providing a tactile feedback corresponding to the touch input.     [0112]    In the case where the external device receives a user's touch input and provides a tactile feedback corresponding to the touch input, the shape of the user's grip is important. Especially when the external device is a portable device such as a smart phone, it is difficult to control the portable device with one hand due to an increased display size. Consequently, the user may use the external device conveniently or inconveniently depending on the shape of a user's grip on the external device.     [0113]    Therefore, when the components of the first UI in the external device include a keypad, the HMD may detect the shape of the user's grip on the external device from a captured image. In addition, the HMD may provide a preset component on the second UI according to the detected grip shape. The preset component may be a keypad of which the layout has been adjusted to facilitate the user's touch according to the detected grip shape. This will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 9 .     [0114]    FIG. 9 illustrates an embodiment of displaying a component of which the layout has been adjusted on the HMD according to a user's grip according to the present invention.     [0115]    If components of the first UI recognized to generate the second UI include a keypad, an HMD 920 may detect the shape of the user's grip on an external device 910 from an image captured by the HMD 920, as described before.     [0116]    The HMD 920 may store a keypad with a layout adjusted to increase user convenience according to the shape of the user's grip in the storage unit. Thus, the keypad with a preset layout according to the detected shape of the grip is generated as a component of a second UI 921. Therefore, the layout of the keypad included in the second UI 921 may be different from that of the keypad included in the first UI.     [0117]    When the HMD 920 displays the second UI 921, the external device 910 may display a protection layer 911 over a component of the first UI overlaid with the second UI 921.     [0118]    As illustrated in FIG. 9(a) , the protection layer 911 may include the outlines of the keypad included in the second UI 921. That is, although the keypads included in the first and second UIs have different layouts, the user sees the second UI and thus the protection layer 911 may include an outline corresponding to the layout of the keypad included in the second UI 921.     [0119]    Therefore, the outline of the keypad included in the protection layer 911 matches to that of the keypad displayed on the second UI 921. In addition, the component of the second UI 921 including the keypad may lie over the outline of the protection layer 911.     [0120]    The external device 920 may provide a tactile feedback corresponding to a user's touch input to the protection layer 911 on the first UI. Since the protection layer 911 includes the keypad outline of the second UI adjusted according to the shape of a user's grip, the external device 910 may provide a tactile feedback adjusted according to the outline included in the protection layer 911.     [0121]    Therefore, the user can feel the outline of the keypad from the tactile feedback and thus can touch keys easily.     [0122]    The user touches the keypad of the first UI, viewing a keypad having a different layout. Therefore, a key input corresponding to the user's touch input may be identified from an image captured by the HMD or by receiving information about the position of the touch input from the external device and matching the position information to the keypad.     [0123]    FIG. 9(a) illustrates a keypad with a layout adjusted according to the shape of a user's grip, as a component according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 9(b) illustrates a call-related menu with a layout adjusted according to the shape of a user's grip, as a component according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the case where the HMD 920 displays a menu having at least one selection option for user inputs, as a component, the HMD 920 may change the layout of the menu according to the shape of a user's grip.     [0124]    Therefore, when components of the first UI recognized to generate the second UI include a menu having at least one selection option, the HMD 920 may detect the shape of a user's grip on the external device 910 using a captured image.     [0125]    The HMD 920 may store the menu having a layout adjusted to facilitate the user's use according to the shape of the user's grip in the storage unit, or may adjust the layout of the menu upon detection and generate the layout-adjusted menu as a component of the second UI 923.     [0126]    When the HMD 920 displays the second UI 923, the external device 910 may display a protection layer 913 over the component of the first UI overlaid with the second UI 923. As illustrated in FIG. 9(b) , the protection layer 913 may include the outline of a menu adjusted according to a detected grip shape.     [0127]    Therefore, the outline of the menu included in the protection layer 913 matches to that of the menu displayed on the second UI 923. That is, the component including the menu of the second UI 923 may be laid over the outline included in the protection layer 913.     [0128]    In addition, the external device 910 may provide a tactile feedback corresponding to a user's touch input to the protection layer 913 through the first UI. Since the protection layer 913 includes the outline of the menu adjusted according to the shape of the user's grip in the second UI 923, the external device 910 may provide a tactile feedback adjusted according to the outline included in the protection layer 913.     [0129]    It has been described above according to an embodiment of the present invention that a protection layer displayed on an external device is a dark screen so that a user may not view data in the displayed area of the protection layer. Meanwhile, the user may want to see data on the external device, in spite of privacy protection required for the data. Accordingly, the present invention provides an external device that allows a user to control the display property of the protection layer.     [0130]    FIG. 10 illustrates an embodiment of controlling the display property of a protection layer on the external device according to the present invention.     [0131]    According to the present invention, the external device may provide the first UI with an interface for adjusting the display property of a protection layer according to a user's input regarding a component over which the protection layer is displayed.     [0132]    Referring to FIG. 10(a) , while displaying a protection layer 1013 taking the form of a dark screen, the first UI may provide an interface 1011 for allowing the user to adjust the transparency of the protection layer 1013. When the user manipulates the interface 1011 to adjust the transparency of the protection layer 1013, the external device may display a transparent protection layer 1023 as illustrated in FIG. 10(b) .     [0133]    While the display property of a protection layer is shown in FIG. 10 as transparency in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the display property may include at least one of chroma and transparency, not limited to transparency.     [0134]    Meanwhile, the external device is not limited to a specific device in the present invention. Thus the external device may be any device, as far as it is provided with a display unit and connectable to an HMD through a network. However, if the external device is a specific device, its utilization increases, which will be described with reference to FIGS. 11 to 14 .     [0135]    FIG. 11 illustrates an embodiment of the external device being a smart TV according to the present invention.     [0136]    Along with the rapid growth of smart TVs, more and more users use smart TVs. Since smart TVs provide a variety of types of content in Video On Demand (VOD) as well as terrestrial broadcasting, user enjoy more and more paid content. As a consequence, a user should enter a user ID and a password in many cases, when the user is to view a smart TV 1110, as illustrated in FIG. 11 (a) . When the smart TV 1110 provides a first UI 1111 for receiving the user ID and the password, the user may enter the user ID and the password using a remote controller 1120.     [0137]    Despite an environment in which only a predetermined number of users use the smart TV 1110 within a limited space, content may be restricted only to specific users according to the type of the content. When needed, the user ID and password should be protected against exposure to nearby people. However, when the user enters the user ID and passwords using the remote controller 1120, specific input keys are displayed enlarged and thus the user ID and password are disclosed as illustrated in FIG. 11(a) .     [0138]    Therefore, an HMD 1130 of the present invention may recognize a component of the smart TV 1110 and provide the recognized component on a second UI 1131, as illustrated in FIG. 11(b) . The second UI 1131 may be laid over the component of the first UI being displayed on the smart TV 1110. The smart TV 1110 may display a protection layer over the component of the first UI overlaid with the second UI 1131.     [0139]    The smart TV 1110 may receive a user input through the remote controller 1120 and the HMD 1130 may additionally provide data corresponding to the input signal currently received on the second UI 1131.     [0140]    FIG. 12 illustrates another embodiment of the external device being a digital door lock according to the present invention.     [0141]    A digital door lock 1210 illustrated in FIG. 12(a) has recently been popular in offices or apartments. When a preset password is input to a first UI 1211 of the digital door lock 1210, the digital door lock 1210 is released. However, since the digital door lock 1210 is exposed to the outside, the password is likely to be exposed to outsiders while a user is entering the password.     [0142]    Therefore, an HMD 1220 recognizes a component for entering a password on the first UI 1211 and provides a second UI 1221 with the recognized component in the present invention. The digital door lock 1210 may display a protection layer 1213 on the first UI 1211.     [0143]    As illustrated in FIG. 12(b) , a keypad included in the second UI 1221 may be configured to have a different layout from that of a keypad included in the first UI 1211. Thus, even though an outsider sees the user entering the password, he or she cannot identify input keys. Therefore, the password is not exposed.     [0144]    In addition, the protection layer 1213 displayed on the first UI 1211 may include the outline of the component. The first UI 1211 may further provide a tactile feedback corresponding to a user's touch input.     [0145]    FIG. 13 illustrates another embodiment of the external device being a smart phone according to the present invention.     [0146]    It has been described that the external device is a portable device and components recognized for generation of a second UI by the HMD are a keypad and a window for outputting data corresponding to an input to the keypad.     [0147]    However, many other components than the keypad and the window may require data protection. Referring to FIG. 13(a) , in the case where the portable device is a smart phone 1310, when messages are transmitted and received between users by Social Networking Service (SNS), the smart phone 1310 may provide a component 1311 that displays a message transmission and reception history. Since messages carry personal data in many cases, they often require privacy protection.     [0148]    Therefore, an HMD 1320 may recognize the component 1311 for displaying a message transmission and reception history and provide the component 1311 on a second UI 1321. The smart phone 1310 may display a protection layer 1313 over the component 1311.     [0149]    Therefore, the user may more conveniently transmit a message to or receive a message from another user without worrying about message leakage even in a public place. Further, the HMD and the external device can prevent data exposure to the outside, thereby enhancing security according to the present invention.     [0150]    FIG. 14 illustrates a further embodiment of the external device being an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) according to the present invention.     [0151]    ATMs are installed in public places. Therefore, when a user enters the password of an account on a first UI 1411 of an ATM 1410, the user should always be careful lest the password should be exposed to a nearby person.     [0152]    Accordingly, an HMD 1420 may recognize a component required for entering a password in the first UI 1411 and provide the recognized component in a second UI 1421. The second UI 1421 may be laid over the first UI 1411. Accordingly, the user may deal with an ATM, while viewing the first and second UIs 1411 and 1421. Therefore, user convenience can be increased.     [0153]    Since the ATM 1410 receives a user input, the first UI 1411 may display a protection layer 1413 so that a nearby person cannot identify input data.     [0154]    FIG. 15 is a flowchart illustrating a method for controlling the HMD according to an embodiment of the present invention. With reference to FIG. 15 , an embodiment of a method for controlling an HMD connected to an external device through a network in order to protect personal information will be described below.     [0155]    Referring to FIG. 15 , the HMD may detect the external device in an image captured by the sensor unit (S1500). The HMD may detect the external device by processing the captured image or using the position and direction of the HMD and the position of the external device. The external device is connected to the HMD through a network. The external device covers all possible devices that can display a first UI.     [0156]    The HMD may recognize at least one component of the first UI of the external device (S1510). As described before with reference to FIG. 4 , the at least one component may include at least one of a keypad, a window for outputting data corresponding to an input signal to the keypad, a user menu including at least one selection option, and a window for displaying preset data.     [0157]    In addition, the HMD may recognize the at least one component of the first UI by the image processing and recognition method using an image captured by the HMD as described before with reference to FIG. 6 , or using component information received from the external device.     [0158]    As described before with reference to FIGS. 5 , 6 and 7 , the HMD may generate and display a second UI including the recognized at least one component (S1520). The displayed second UI may be laid over the first UI being displayed on the first UI, using the image from which the external device has been detected.     [0159]    As described before with reference to FIG. 8 , the external device may display a protection layer over the component of the first UI overlaid with the second UI. The first UI may include an interface for adjusting the display property of the protection layer according to a user input, as described before with reference to FIG. 10 .     [0160]    The HMD may display data corresponding to an input signal currently received at the external device on the second UI as described before with reference to FIG. 5 (S1530). Accordingly, the HMD and the external device interacting with the HMD over the network can reduce the risk of exposure of data input to the external device to nearby persons.      Mode for the Invention     [0161]    Various embodiments have been described in the best mode for carrying out the invention.      Industrial Applicability     [0162]    The present invention provides an HMD and a method for controlling the same.     [0163]    While the present invention has been described with reference to separate drawings for convenience's sake, a new embodiment may be implemented by embodiments described in the drawings. When needed, designing a recording medium readable by a computer to which a program for implementing the afore-described embodiments of the present invention is written may fall within the scope of the present invention.

BACKGROUND ART    [0002]    Cutting work on steel products, castings, and the like has conventionally been carried out using a cutting tool formed of cemented carbide. Such cutting tool often suffers from a problem of wear or fracturing damage of the cutting edge during cutting work due to exposure of the cutting edge to a tough environment, such as high temperature and high pressure. Thus, the cutting tool has a problem in cutting performance.     [0003]    Therefore, a coating for coating a surface of a base member, such as one formed of cemented carbide, has been under development for the purpose of improving cutting performance of cutting tools. Among others, a coating formed of a compound of titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), and nitrogen (N) (hereinafter also referred to as ""TiAIN"") can have high hardness, and can improve oxidation resistance by increasing the content ratio of Al. Since performance of a cutting tool can be improved by coating the cutting tool with such a coating, further development of such coating is demanded.     [0004]    For example, PTD 1 discloses a hard coating that includes at least one Ti1-xAlxN hard coating produced by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) without plasma excitation. The Ti1-xAlxN hard coating is present as a monophase layer of a cubic NaCl structure having a stoichiometric coefficient of x > 0.75 up to x = 0.93 and a lattice constant afccof from 0.412 nm to 0.405 nm; or the Ti1-xAlxN hard coating has a primary phase formed of Ti1-xAlxN having a cubic NaCl structure having a stoichiometric coefficient of x > 0.75 up to x = 0.93 and a lattice constant afccof from 0.412 nm to 0.405 nm. In addition, the Ti1-xAlxN hard coating is a multiphase layer including, as an additional phase, Ti1-xAlxN in a wurtzite structure and/or TiNxin a NaCl structure, and the chlorine content rate of Ti1-xAlxN hard coating is in a range of from 0.05 to 0.9 atomic %. NPD 1 also discloses a similar technique.     [0005]    NPD 2 discloses a Ti0.05Al0.95N film having a thickness of 5 m, deposited on a substrate such as one formed of WC-Co by a CVD method using AlCl3, TiCl4, N2, and NH3as the reactant gases, and H2as the carrier gas, under conditions of a pressure of 3 kPa and a temperature of 800C. The Ti0.05Al0.95N film of NPD 2 has a nanolaminate structure having a self-organized cubic TiN (c-TiN) layer and a wurtzite AlN (w-AIN) layer being alternately stacked, and a separation region formed of w-AlN and cubic AlN (c-AlN). In this nanolaminate structure, a (110) plane of c-TiN and a (100) plane of w-AlN are parallel to each other. The ratios of w-AlN, c-AlN (c-Al(Ti)N), and c-TiN that form the Ti0.05Al0.95N film of NPD 2 are 53%, 26%, and 21%, respectively. NPD 2 also discloses that the hardness of the Ti0.05Al0.95N film is about 28 GPa, and that the compressive residual stress of c-Al(Ti)N is -1.2  0.1 GPa.     [0006]    NPD 3 discloses evaluation of oxidation resistance of a Ti0.05Al0.95N film having a nanolaminate structure having a self-organized c-TiN layer and a w-AlN layer being alternately stacked. According to the description of NPD 3, when the Ti0.05Al0.95N film was oxidized at temperatures from 700C to 1200C in air for one hour, the Ti0.05Al0.95N film had good oxidation resistance up to 1050C, whereas local degradation of the surface occurred after the temperature exceeded 1100C. NPD 3 also discloses that the hardness of about 29 GPa and the compressive residual stress of -2 GPa of the Ti0.05Al0.95N film are maintained up to a temperature of 1050C.     [0007]    PTD 2 discloses a method for producing, by a CVD method, a hard coating having a structure in which a TiN layer of 2 nm thick having a face-centered cubic lattice (fcc) structure and an AlN layer of 6 nm thick having an fcc structure are alternately stacked, by introducing AlCl3gas, TiCl4gas, NH3gas, H2gas, and N2gas into a reaction vessel at a pressure of 1.3 kPa and a temperature of 800C, and then cooling the reaction vessel at a cooling rate of 10C/min until the temperature of the base member reaches 200C (see paragraphs 0062 and 0063 of PTD 2).

Such coatings are quasi-stable in cubic crystals, and thus, exposure of the coatings to a high temperature may result in phase transition to a wurtzite structure, thereby causing a reduction in the hardness. Thus, when the Ti1-xAlxN hard coatings of PTD 1 and NPD 1 are used in cutting tools, phase transition to a wurtzite structure caused by frictional sliding heat during cutting work results in a reduction in the hardness, and thus wear resistance of the Ti1xAlxN hard coatings is reduced. As a result, particularly in low-speed cutting, chipping of the Ti1-xAlxN hard coatings occurs, and thus life extension of a cutting tool cannot be achieved.     [0011]    The Ti0.05Al0.95N films described in NPD 2 and NPD 3 each have a nanolaminate structure having a self-organized c-TiN layer and a w-AlN layer being alternately stacked, and therefore, do not suffer from a problem that phase transition to the wurtzite structure caused by frictional sliding heat results in a reduction in the hardness during cutting work, unlike those of PTD 1 and NPD 1. However, the nanolaminate structures of the Ti0.05Al0.95N films described in NPD 2 and NPD 3 each contain w-AlN having a lower hardness than that of c-TiN in a higher content than that of c-TiN. This reduces the hardness of the overall Ti0.05Al0.95N films. Therefore, the Ti0.05Al0.95N films described in NPD 2 and NPD 3 cannot have sufficiently high wear resistance, and thus life extension of a cutting tool cannot be achieved.     [0012]    In PTD 2, the hard coating is formed only of a structure in which an fcc structure TiN layer and an fcc structure AlN layer are alternately stacked. Therefore, the hardness of the hard coating is significantly high, and the wear resistance of the hard coating is high. However, when the hard coating described in PTD 2 is used in a cutting tool, high-speed cutting may cause chipping, and depending on the work material, may suddenly cause a fracture, which may prevent life extension of a cutting tool. The reason for this is unclear, but this is supposedly due to tensile residual stress generated in the fcc structure AlN caused by a lattice mismatch between the fcc structure TiN and the fcc structure AlN in the stacking direction. That is, the lattice constant of the fcc structure AlN is from about 0.412 nm to about 0.405 nm, and the lattice constant of the fcc structure TiN is about 0.424 nm; and a structure in which the fcc structure TiN and the fcc structure AlN are alternately stacked forms a nanoscale, super-multilayer structure. This always requires the fcc structure AlN having the smaller lattice constant to match the fcc structure TiN having the larger lattice constant. This generates tensile residual stress in the fcc structure AlN. The chipping and fracture described above are considered to be caused by tensile residual stress in the fcc structure AlN.     [0013]    Thus, a cutting tool having a long life has not yet been achieved, and development of such cutting tool is desired.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS    [Description of embodiment of present invention]    [0019]    To begin with, aspects of the present invention will be described in sequence.(1) A hard coating according to one aspect of the present invention includes two first crystalline phases, and a second crystalline phase disposed between the two first crystalline phases. The two first crystalline phases each include, independently, a laminate structure having a Ti1-x1 Alx1 N phase having a sodium chloride-type crystal structure, and an Alx2 Ti1-x2 N phase having a sodium chloride-type crystal structure that are alternately stacked, an A1 composition ratio x1 of the Ti1-x1 Alx1 N phase satisfies a relationship 0.5  x1  0.75, an Al composition ratio x2 of the Alx2 Ti1-x2 N phase satisfies a relationship 0.75 < x2  0.95, the laminate structure includes a region in which an A1 concentration periodically changes along a stacking direction of the Ti1-x1 Alx1 N phase and the Alx2 Ti1-x2 N phase, in this region, a difference between a maximum value of the A1 composition ratio x2 and a minimum value of the Al composition ratio x1 is greater than 0.25, and the second crystalline phase contains AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure. Using such configuration, impact exerted on the two first crystalline phases during cutting can be alleviated by the second crystalline phase located between the two first crystalline phases, and thus life extension of a cutting tool can be achieved.(2) In a hard coating according to one aspect of the present invention, the total thickness of the per-phase thickness of the Ti1-x1 Alx1 N phase and the per-phase thickness of the Alx2 Ti1-x2 N phase, the phases located next to each other, is preferably greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm. When the total thickness is greater than or equal to 1 nm, production of a hard coating is easy. When the total thickness is less than or equal to 50 nm, strain relaxation at a boundary between the Ti1-x1 Alx1 N phase and the Alx2 Ti1-x2 N phase located next to each other, and reduction in wear resistance of the hard coating caused by phase transition of the Alx2 Ti1-x2 N phase having a high Al composition ratio can be inhibited.(3) In a hard coating according to one aspect of the present invention, an electron diffraction image of the second crystalline phase by a transmission electron microscope preferably exhibits a concentric pattern, and a ratio of a diffraction intensity P1 of a (200) plane of the Alx2 Ti1-x2 N phase to a sum of the diffraction intensity P1 and a diffraction intensity P2 of a (100) plane of the second crystalline phase in an X-ray diffraction pattern of the hard coating by an X-ray diffraction method is preferably greater than or equal to 0.2 and less than or equal to 1. When an electron diffraction image of the second crystalline phase by a TEM exhibits a concentric pattern, the second crystalline phase contains AlN grains having highly fine wurtzite-type crystal structures, and thus, adhesion resistance of the hard coating when the hard coating is used in a cutting tool can be improved. In addition, when the value of P1/(P1 + P2) is greater than or equal to 0.2 and less than or equal to 1, the hard coating can be a film in proper balance between high hardness and adhesion resistance.(4) In a hard coating according to one aspect of the present invention, an indentation hardness of the hard coating determined by a nanoindentation method is preferably greater than or equal to 30 GPa. When an indentation hardness of the hard coating determined by a nanoindentation method is greater than or equal to 30 GPa, wear resistance of the hard coating improves, and especially when cutting work is performed on a cut-resistant material such as a heat-resistant alloy using a cutting tool provided with the hard coating, excellent performance can be provided.(5) In a hard coating according to one aspect of the present invention, the absolute value of compressive residual stress of the Alx2 Ti1-x2 N phase is preferably greater than or equal to 0.3 GPa and less than or equal to 3 GPa. When the absolute value of compressive residual stress of the Alx2 Ti1-x2 N phase is greater than or equal to 0.3 GPa and less than or equal to 3 GPa, wear resistance of the hard coating can be made high, and thus, chipping resistance and fracture resistance can be improved.(6) A cutting tool according to one aspect of the present invention is a cutting tool including a base member, and any of the hard coatings described above on the base member. Using such configuration, impact exerted on the two first crystalline phases during cutting can be alleviated by the second crystalline phase located between the two first crystalline phases, and thus life extension of a cutting tool can be achieved.(7) A method for producing a hard coating according to one aspect of the present invention is a method for producing a hard coating including an ejection step of ejecting, onto a base member, each of a first gas containing halogenated titanium gas and halogenated aluminum gas, and a second gas containing ammonia gas, a first cooling step of cooling the base member to a temperature higher than or equal to 700C and lower than or equal to 750C at a cooling rate higher than 10C/min, a maintenance step of maintaining the base member at a temperature higher than or equal to 700C and lower than or equal to 750C, and a second cooling step of cooling the base member after the maintenance step, wherein a cooling rate for the base member in the second cooling step is lower than the cooling rate for the base member in the first cooling step. Using such configuration, impact exerted on the two first crystalline phases during cutting can be alleviated by the second crystalline phase located between the two first crystalline phases, and thus a cutting tool having a long life can be produced.(8) In a method for producing a hard coating according to one aspect of the present invention, the base member is preferably maintained for a time period longer than or equal to 30 minutes and shorter than or equal to 300 minutes in the maintenance step. Using such configuration, the hard coating including the first crystalline phases and the second crystalline phase can be suitably formed.(9) In a method for producing a hard coating according to one aspect of the present invention, the base member is preferably cooled to a temperature above 200C and lower than or equal to 400C at a cooling rate higher than or equal to 5C/min and lower than or equal to 10C/min in the second cooling step. Using such configuration, the hard coating including the first crystalline phases and the second crystalline phase can be suitably formed.(10) In a method for producing a hard coating according to one aspect of the present invention, the first gas preferably further contains hydrogen chloride gas. In this case, there is a tendency that wear resistance of the hard coating can be improved.    [Details of embodiment of present invention]    [0020]    An embodiment will be described below. Like reference symbols designate identical or corresponding portions throughout the drawings used for describing the embodiment.     <Cutting Tool>    [0021]    Fig. 1 shows a schematic cross-sectional view of a cutting tool of the embodiment. As shown in Fig. 1 , the cutting tool of the embodiment includes a base member 11, and a coating 50 provided on base member 11. Coating 50 includes a substrate film 20 and a hard coating 30 provided on substrate film 20.     <Hard Coating>    [0022]    Fig. 2 shows a schematic enlarged cross-sectional view of one example of hard coating 30 shown in Fig. 1 . As shown in Fig. 2 , hard coating 30 includes two first crystalline phases 21, and a second crystalline phase 22 disposed between two first crystalline phases 21 located next to each other. In this embodiment, at a boundary between first crystalline phase 21 and second crystalline phase 22, first crystalline phase 21 and second crystalline phase 22 may be completely separate from each other without including, in each phase, any atoms from the other phase; a portion of Ti atoms of first crystalline phase 21 may be included in second crystalline phase 22, or a portion of A1 atoms of second crystalline phase 22 may be included in first crystalline phase 21. Note that it is sufficient for hard coating 30 to include at least two first crystalline phases 21, and hard coating 30 may thus include three or more first crystalline phases 21.     <First Crystalline Phases>    [0023]    Fig. 3 shows a schematic enlarged cross-sectional view of one example of one of first crystalline phases 21 shown in Fig. 2 As shown in Fig. 3 , first crystalline phase 21 includes a laminate structure having a Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a having a sodium chloride (NaCl)-type crystal structure, and an Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21 b having a NaCl-type crystal structure that are alternately stacked. Here, an Al composition ratio x1 of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a satisfies a relationship 0.5  x1 0.75, while an Al composition ratio x2 of the Alx2Ti1-x2N phase satisfies a relationship 0.75 < x2  0.95. The laminate structure includes a region in which the Al concentration periodically changes along a stacking direction of the Ti1-x1Alx1N phase and the Alx2Ti1-x2N phase. In this region, the difference between a maximum value of Al composition ratio x2 and a minimum value of A1 composition ratio x1 is greater than 0.25. Here, from a viewpoint of seeking life extension of a cutting tool, the difference between the maximum value of Al composition ratio x2 and the minimum value of A1 composition ratio x1 in this region is preferably greater than 0.27, and more preferably greater than 0.3.     [0024]    In this embodiment, at a boundary between Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b, Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b may be completely separate from each other without including, in each phase, any atoms from the other phase; a portion of atoms of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a may be included in Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b; or a portion of atoms of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21 b may be included in Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a.     [0025]    In this regard, the A1 concentration is a ratio of the number of Al atoms to the total number of atoms at one arbitrary point in the laminate structure of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b, and can be determined by EDX or the like. The phrase ""Al concentration periodically changes"" means that, letting one period denote a continuous set of an increase and a decrease of an Al concentration in the stacking direction of the Ti1-x1Alx1N phase and the Alx2Ti1-x2N phase, the laminate structure of Th1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b includes at least two periods. In the stacking direction of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b in the laminate structure of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b, the A1 concentration may periodically change, for example, sinusoidally or in other manner.     [0026]    That Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b of first crystalline phase 21 each have a sodium chloride-type crystal structure can be verified by an observation using a TEM.     [0027]    The composition (constituent elements and constituent ratio between constituent elements) of Ti1x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b of first crystalline phase 21 can be obtained by EDX or three-dimensional atom probe field ion microscopic analysis.     [0028]    In first crystalline phases 21, a total thickness t3 of a per-phase thickness t1 of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and a per-phase thickness t2 of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21 b located next to each other is preferably greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm. When total thickness t3 is greater than or equal to 1 nm, production of hard coating 30 is easy. When total thickness t3 is less than or equal to 50 nm, strain relaxation at a boundary between Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b located next to each other, and reduction in wear resistance of hard coating 30 caused by phase transition of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b having a high Al composition ratio can be inhibited.     [0029]    Although it is sufficient that, in first crystalline phases 21, the total thickness of at least one pair of one phase of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21 a and one phase of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21 b located next to each other is greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm, the total thicknesses of all the pairs of one phase of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and one phase of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b located next to each other are preferably greater than or equal to 1 nm and less than or equal to 50 nm from a viewpoint of stably producing hard coating 30 having excellent wear resistance.     [0030]    The per-phase thickness t1 of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and the per-phase thickness t2 of Alx2Ti1x2N phase 21b can each be determined by forming hard coating 30 on a surface of base member 11, and observing a cross section of hard coating 30 formed on the surface of base member 11 by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) using STEM.     <Second Crystalline Phase>    [0031]    Second crystalline phase 22 contains AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure. As described above, AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure has a low hardness in general. However, in this embodiment, second crystalline phase 22 containing AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure functions to alleviate impact on first crystalline phases 21 that contribute to improvement of wear resistance of hard coating 30. This contributes to life extension of a cutting tool when hard coating 30 is used for the cutting tool.     [0032]    Note that existence of second crystalline phase 22 can be verified by an observation using a TEM.     <Base Member>    [0033]    Base member 11 may be, for example, tungsten carbide (WC) matrix cemented carbide, a cermet, high-speed steel, ceramic, a cubic boron nitride sintered body, a diamond sintered body, or the like, but is not necessarily limited thereto.     <Substrate film>    [0034]    Substrate film 20 can be one capable of improving adhesion between base member 11 and hard coating 30, and may be, for example, a titanium nitride (TiN) film, a titanium carbonitride (TiCN) film, or a laminate film of a TiN film and a TiCN film.     <Cutting Tool>    [0035]    The cutting tool of the embodiment is not specifically limited as long as the cutting tool includes base member 11 and hard coating 30 on base member 11. Examples thereof include a drill, an end mill, an indexable cutting insert for drilling, an indexable cutting insert for end milling, an indexable cutting insert for milling, an indexable cutting insert for turning, a metal saw, a gear-cutting tool, a reamer, and a tap.     <Production Method>    [0036]    Fig. 4 shows a schematic cross-sectional view of one example of a CVD apparatus for use in manufacturing a cutting tool of the embodiment. As shown in Fig. 4 , a CVD apparatus 10 includes a plurality of base member setting fixtures 12 for placing base members 11, and a reaction vessel 13 made of heat-resistant alloy steel that covers base member setting fixtures 12 A temperature regulating device 14 for controlling the temperature inside reaction vessel 13 is provided around reaction vessel 13.     [0037]    In reaction vessel 13, a gas introduction tube 16 having a first gas introduction tube 15 and a second gas introduction tube 17 joined together in an adjacent manner is rotatably provided extending in a vertical direction in the space inside reaction vessel 13. Gas introduction tube 16 is configured such that a gas introduced into first gas introduction tube 15 and a gas introduced into second gas introduction tube 17 will not mix with each other in gas introduction tube 16. In addition, a plurality of through holes are provided in portions of first gas introduction tube 15 and portions of second gas introduction tube 17 for ejecting gases flowing in first gas introduction tube 15 and second gas introduction tube 17 onto base members 11 placed in base member setting fixtures 12.     [0038]    Reaction vessel 13 is also provided with a gas exhaust pipe 18 for exhausting a gas in reaction vessel 13 to the outside. The gas in reaction vessel 13 passes through gas exhaust pipe 18, and is then exhausted from a gas exhaust port 19 to the outside of reaction vessel 13.     [0039]    Fig. 5 shows a flowchart of one example of a method for manufacturing a cutting tool of the embodiment. As shown in Fig. 5 , a method for manufacturing a cutting tool of the embodiment includes an ejection step (S10), a first cooling step (S20), a maintenance step (S30), and a second cooling step (S40), and is performed in order of S10, S20, S30, and S40. Needless to say, the method for manufacturing a cutting tool of the embodiment may include a step or steps other than S10, S20, S30, and S40. Note that, for purposes of illustration, formation of hard coating 30 on base member 11 will be described below. However, it is needless to say that hard coating 30 may be formed after formation of other films such as substrate film 20 on base member 11.     <Ejection Step>    [0040]    Ejection step (S10) is performed by ejecting a first gas containing halogenated titanium gas and halogenated aluminum gas, and a second gas containing ammonia (NH3) gas, onto base member 11.     [0041]    Ejection step (S10) can be performed, for example, in the following manner. First, the temperature in reaction vessel 13 is raised by temperature regulating device 14 to raise the temperature of base members 11 placed in base member setting fixtures 12 in reaction vessel 13 to, for example, a temperature of from 820C to 860C. The pressure in reaction vessel 13 is, for example, from 1 kPa to 2.5 kPa.     [0042]    Next, with gas introduction tube 16 being rotated about an axis, the first gas containing halogenated titanium gas and halogenated aluminum gas is introduced into gas introduction tube 15, and the second gas containing NH3gas is introduced into gas introduction tube 17. This permits the mixed gas having the first gas and the second gas being homogenized to be ejected toward the surfaces of the base members 11. As a result, the gas components contained in the first gas and the gas components contained in the second gas chemically react with one another on base members 11, and thus a melt containing Al, Ti, and N (hereinafter referred to as ""AlyTi1-yN"") is formed on base members 11 by a CVD method.     [0043]    Here, the halogenated titanium gas may be, for example, titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) gas. The halogenated aluminum gas may be, for example, aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) gas.     [0044]    The first gas contains the halogenated titanium gas and the halogenated aluminum gas, and preferably further contains hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas. In this case, there is a tendency that wear resistance of hard coating 30 can be improved. Each of the first gas and the second gas may contain a carrier gas, such as, for example, nitrogen gas (N2gas) and/or hydrogen gas (H2gas).     <First Cooling Step>    [0045]    After ejection step (S10), first cooling step (S20) is performed. First cooling step (S20) can be performed by, for example, regulating the set temperature of temperature regulating device 14 to cool base members 11 to a temperature higher than or equal to 700C and lower than or equal to 750C at a cooling rate higher than 10C/min.     [0046]    By ensuring the cooling rate for base members 11 of higher than 10C/min, formation of AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure in first cooling step (S20) can be inhibited. From a viewpoint of inhibiting formation of AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure in first cooling step (S20), the cooling rate in first cooling step (S20) is preferably higher or equal to 15C/min. In addition, the upper limit of the cooling rate for base members 11 in first cooling step (S20) is preferably lower than or equal to 30C/min from a viewpoint of achieving tighter contact with hard coating 30.     [0047]    By ensuring the ultimate temperature to which base members 11 are cooled in first cooling step (S20) of higher than or equal to 700C and lower than or equal to 750C, first crystalline phases 21 each having an alternate laminate structure of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b can be suitably formed in maintenance step (S30) described later herein. Note that if base members I are cooled to a temperature below 700C in first cooling step (S20), a zinc blende-type AlN phase may be formed instead of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b in maintenance step (S30), whereas if base members 11 are cooled to a temperature above 750C in first cooling step (S20), since atoms are more active above 750C, mixed crystals of first crystalline phases 21 and second crystalline phase 22 may be formed.     <Maintenance Step>    [0048]    After first cooling step (S20), maintenance step (S30) is performed. Maintenance step (S30) can be performed by, for example, regulating the set temperature of temperature regulating device 14 to maintain base members 11 at a temperature higher than or equal to 700C and lower than or equal to 750C. In maintenance step (S30), phase separation of AlyTi1-yN permits first crystalline phases 21 each having an alternate laminate structure of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b to be formed and grown.     [0049]    The temperature maintenance time of base members 11 in maintenance step (S30) may be appropriately set according to a desired thickness of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and a desired thickness of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b. However, this temperature maintenance time is preferably a time period longer than or equal to 30 minutes and shorter than or equal to 300 minutes. By ensuring a temperature maintenance time of base members 11 of longer than or equal to 30 minutes, Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b can be sufficiently grown to an extent that allows first crystalline phases 21 to function to a sufficient degree. There is a tendency that, by ensuring a temperature maintenance time of base members 11 of shorter than or equal to 300 minutes, Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1x2N phase 21b do not grow to an excessive degree, and second crystalline phase 22 containing AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure can be formed in second cooling step (S40) described later herein.     [0050]    Note that, in this embodiment, the temperature of base members 11 in maintenance step (S30) does not necessarily need to be a completely constant temperature, but the temperature of base members 11 may vary in a range of higher than or equal to 700C and lower than or equal to 750C.     <Second Cooling Step>    [0051]    After maintenance step (S30), second cooling step (S40) is performed. Second cooling step (S40) can be performed by, for example, regulating the set temperature of temperature regulating device 14 to lower the temperature of base members 11.     [0052]    The cooling rate for base members 11 in second cooling step (S40) can be a cooling rate that is lower than the cooling rate for base members 11 in first cooling step (S20), and which permits second crystalline phase 22 containing AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure to be formed in second cooling step (S40).     [0053]    The cooling rate for base members 11 in second cooling step (S40) is preferably a cooling rate higher than or equal to 5C/min and lower than or equal to 10C/min from a viewpoint of inhibiting the reduction in hardness of hard coating 30.     [0054]    In second cooling step (S40), the ultimate temperature to which base members 11 are cooled is preferably above 200C and lower than or equal to 400C. When the ultimate temperature to which base members 11 are cooled is above 200C and lower than or equal to 400C in second cooling step (S40), second crystalline phase 22 containing AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure can be formed to a sufficient degree.     [0055]    Fig. 6 schematically shows one example of a binodal line and a spinodal line of AlyTi1-yN. The horizontal axis of Fig. 6 represents the Al composition ratio y of AlyTi1-yN, with the value of the Al composition ratio y of AlyTi1-yN increasing from left to right along the horizontal axis of Fig. 6 . The vertical axis of Fig. 6 represents the temperature [C] of base members 11, with the temperature of base members 11 rising from bottom to top along the vertical axis of Fig. 6 .     [0056]    With reference to Fig. 6 , one example of formation mechanism of the first crystalline phases and the second crystalline phase in ejection step (S10), first cooling step (S20), maintenance step (S30), and second cooling step (S40) will be inferred below.     [0057]    First, a gas is prepared so that the A1 composition ratio y of AlyTi1-yN will be 0.75, and the gas is ejected onto the base members in ejection step (S10). This causes AlyTi1-yN to be formed on the base members by a CVD method. The condition immediately after the formation of AlyTi1-yN is represented at a point  of Fig. 6 . At the point  of Fig. 6 , the temperature of base members 11 is, for example, in a range of from 820C to 860C.     [0058]    Next, in first cooling step (S20), base members 11 are rapidly cooled at a cooling rate higher than 10C/min to the ultimate temperature of base members 11 of 700C. This condition is represented at a point  of Fig. 6 . In first cooling step (S20), rapid cooling of base members 11 at a cooling rate higher than 10C/min causes the temperature to be lowered, crossing a binodal line 41, down to the temperature at the point  (700C) below a spinodal line 42.     [0059]    Here, a region under binodal line 41 represents the conditions in which AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure, which is a thermal equilibrium phase, is formed when cooling is performed at a low cooling rate. A region under spinodal line 42 represents the conditions in which Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b each having a NaCl-type crystal structure, which are non-thermal equilibrium phases, are formed by phase separation of AlyTi1-yN when cooling is performed at a high cooling rate. Thus, in first cooling step (S20), formation of AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure can be inhibited, and the temperature of base members 11 can be directed to a temperature that permits Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b to be formed.     [0060]    Next, in maintenance step (S30), the temperature of base members 11 is maintained at a temperature higher than or equal to 700C and lower than or equal to 750C. In maintenance step (S30), phase separation of AlyTi1-yN causes Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a having a NaCl-type crystal structure and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21 b having a NaCl-type crystal structure to separate from each other, and thus first crystalline phases 21 including a structure with these phases alternately stacked is formed. In addition, the maintenance time of base members 11 in maintenance step (S30) determines the thickness of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and the thickness of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b.     [0061]    Next, in second cooling step (S40), base members 11 are slowly cooled to 400C at a cooling rate that is lower than the cooling rate in first cooling step (S20), and is higher than or equal to 5C/min and lower than or equal to 10C/min, which is sufficient for formation of AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure. The final condition of base members 11 in second cooling step (S40) is represented at a point  of Fig. 6 .     [0062]    In second cooling step (S40), slow cooling of base members 11 results in formation of second crystalline phase 22 containing AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure.     [0063]    As described above, hard coating 30 that includes first crystalline phases 21 including a structure having Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a having a NaCl-type crystal structure and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b having a NaCl-type crystal structure that are alternately stacked, and second crystalline phase 22 containing AlN of a wurtzite-type crystal structure, is formed on base member 11, and thus a cutting tool of the embodiment is manufactured.     <Characteristics of Hard Coating>    <<TEM and XRD>>    [0064]    Fig. 7 shows a TEM image of hard coating 30 of the cutting tool of the embodiment manufactured as described above. Fig. 8 shows an enlarged TEM image of the area enclosed by the solid lines of Fig. 7 .     [0065]    As shown in Figs. 7 and 8 , it has been verified that, in a certain region of hard coating 30, first crystalline phases 21 each having a structure having Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a having a NaCl-type crystal structure and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b having a NaCl-type crystal structure that were alternately stacked were present, and second crystalline phase 22 containing AlN of a wurtzite-type crystal structure, disposed between two first crystalline phases 21, were present.     [0066]    Fig. 9 shows an electron diffraction image by a TEM of the region A of second crystalline phase 22 of Fig. 8. Fig. 10 shows an electron diffraction image by a TEM of the region B of first crystalline phase 21 of Fig. 8 . While the electron diffraction image by a TEM of the region A of second crystalline phase 22 exhibits a concentric pattern as shown in Fig. 9 , the electron diffraction image by a TEM of the region B of first crystalline phase 21 exhibits a dot pattern as shown in Fig. 10 . This indicates that second crystalline phase 22 includes a plurality of crystal grains smaller than those of first crystalline phase 21.     [0067]    In addition to the appearance of a concentric pattern in the electron diffraction image by a TEM of second crystalline phase 22, it is preferable that a ratio of a diffraction intensity P1 of a (200) plane of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b to a sum of the diffraction intensity P1 and a diffraction intensity P2 of a (100) plane of second crystalline phase 22 (i.e., P1/(P1 +P2)) in an XRD pattern of hard coating 30 obtained by an XRD method be greater than or equal to 0.2 and less than or equal to 1. When an electron diffraction image by a TEM of second crystalline phase 22 exhibits a concentric pattern, second crystalline phase 22 contains AlN grains having highly fine wurtzite-type crystal structures, and thus, adhesion resistance of hard coating 30 when hard coating 30 is used in a cutting tool can be improved. In addition, when the value of P1/(P1 + P2) is greater than or equal to 0.2 and less than or equal to 1, hard coating 30 can be a film in proper balance between high hardness and adhesion resistance. Here, from a viewpoint of seeking life extension of the cutting tool, the value of P1/(P1 + P2) is more preferably less than or equal to 0.95, and still more preferably less than or equal to 0.9.     [0068]    Fig. 11 shows one example of an XRD pattern of hard coating 30 obtained by an XRD method. The horizontal axis of Fig. 11 represents the diffraction angle 2 [], and the vertical axis of Fig. 11 represents the diffraction intensity [cps: count per second]. In the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 11 , the ratio P1/(P1 + P2) of a diffraction intensity P1 of a (200) plane of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21 b to a sum of the diffraction intensity P1 and a diffraction intensity P2 of a (100) plane of second crystalline phase 22 is 0.87, which is in a range of greater than or equal to 0.2 and less than or equal to 1.     [0069]    Note that the diffraction intensity P1 of a (200) plane of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b is the intensity at the diffraction peak observed at a 2 in a range of greater than or equal to 43 and less than or equal to 45 along the horizontal axis of the XRD pattern of hard coating 30, and the diffraction intensity P2 of a (100) plane of second crystalline phase 22 is the intensity at the diffraction peak observed at a 2 in a range of greater than or equal to 32 and less than or equal to 35 along the horizontal axis of the XRD pattern of hard coating 30.     [0070]    Fig. 12 shows a TEM image of hard coating 30 of the cutting tool of the embodiment manufactured as described above. Fig. 13(a) shows an EDX image of the region B of first crystalline phase 21 of Fig. 12 ; Fig. 13(b) shows a mapping result of the Al element in the region B of Fig. 12 ; Fig. 13(c) shows a mapping result of the N element in the region B of Fig. 12 ; and Fig. 13(d) shows a mapping result of the Ti element in the region B of Fig. 12 .     [0071]    Fig. 14(a) shows an enlarged image of Fig. 13(a) . Fig. 14(b) shows respective changes in an Al concentration, a N concentration, and a Ti concentration determined by EDX along a stacking direction LG1, shown in Fig. 14(a) , of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b. As shown in Fig. 14(b) , it has been verified that, in the region B of first crystalline phase 21 of hard coating 30 of the cutting tool of the embodiment, the laminate structure of Ti1x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b includes a region in which an A1 concentration periodically changes along a stacking direction of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b. Note that the horizontal axis of Fig. 14(b) represents a distance [nm] from the measurement starting point in the stacking direction of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b, and the vertical axis of Fig. 14(b) represents the respective concentrations [atomic %] of Al, N, and Ti.     [0072]    Fig. 15 shows a change in a ratio of the number of Al atoms to a sum of the number of Al atoms and the number of Ti atoms contained in the laminate structure of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b along a stacking direction of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1x2N phase 21b, calculated from the measurement result obtained by EDX of Figs. 14(a) to 14(d) . Note that the horizontal axis of Fig. 15 represents a distance [nm] from the measurement starting point in the stacking direction of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b, and the vertical axis of Fig. 15 represents the ratio of the number of A1 atoms to the sum of the number of Al atoms and the number of Ti atoms.     [0073]    As shown in Fig. 15 , it has been verified that a difference between the maximum value (X2,6in the example shown in Fig. 15 ) of Al composition ratio x2 of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b and the minimum value (X1,7) of Al composition ratio x1 of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a in the laminate structure of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21 of the hard coating of the embodiment, along the stacking direction of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b, is greater than 0.25. In addition, as shown in Fig. 15 , the distances between Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b having the maximum value (X2,6in the example shown in Fig. 15 ) of Al composition ratio x2 and Alx2Ti1-x2N phases 21b located next thereto are, respectively, 20 nm and 21 nm.     Indentation Hardness    [0074]    An indentation hardness of hard coating 30 determined by a nanoindentation method is preferably greater than or equal to 30 GPa. When an indentation hardness of hard coating 30 determined by a nanoindentation method is greater than or equal to 30 GPa, wear resistance of hard coating 30 improves, and especially when cutting work is performed on a cut-resistant material, such as a heat-resistant alloy, with a cutting tool provided with hard coating 30, excellent performance can be provided.     [0075]    The indentation hardness of hard coating 30 determined by a nanoindentation method can be calculated by dividing a load when an indenter is forced into hard coating 30 in a direction perpendicular to the thickness direction at a predetermined load (e.g., 25 mN) using a nanoindentation hardness tester capable of being used for a nanoindentation method (e.g., one manufactured by ELIONIX Inc.) by the contact area between an indenter and hard coating 30.     Compressive Residual Stress    [0076]    The absolute value of compressive residual stress of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b is preferably greater than or equal to 0.3 GPa and less than or equal to 3 GPa. When the absolute value of compressive residual stress of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21 b is greater than or equal to 0.3 GPa and less than or equal to 3 GPa, wear resistance of hard coating 30 can be made high, and thus, chipping resistance and fracture resistance can be improved. The compressive residual stress of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b can be made greater than or equal to 0.3 GPa and less than or equal to 3 GPa by making an adjustment to a total thickness t3, which is a sum of a per-phase thickness t1 of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and a per-phase thickness t2 of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b located next to each other.     [0077]    As used herein, the term ""compressive residual stress"" is a sort of internal stress (intrinsic stress) present in Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21 b, and refers to stress represented by a negative (-) value (unit: ""GPa"" is used in the embodiment). This means that a concept of large compressive residual stress indicates a large absolute value of the value described above, while a concept of small compressive residual stress indicates a small absolute value of the value described above.     [0078]    The compressive residual stress of Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b can be determined by a sin<2> method using an X-ray stress measurement apparatus. Such sin<2> method using an X-ray is widely used as a method for measuring residual stress in a polycrystalline material. For example, a method can be used which is described in detail on pages 54 to 67 of ""X-sen Ouryoku Sokutei Hou"" (X-ray stress measurement method) (the Society of Materials Science, Japan, published by Yokendo Co., Ltd. in 1981 ).     Impurities    [0079]    Hard coating 30 may or may not contain at least one impurity selected from the group consisting of chlorine (Cl), oxygen (O), and carbon (C).     Entire Thickness of Hard Coating    [0080]    An entire thickness T1 of hard coating 30 shown in Fig. 1 is preferably greater than or equal to 1 m and less than or equal to 20 m. When the entire thickness T1 of hard coating 30 is greater than or equal to 1m, the characteristics of hard coating 30 tend to significantly improve. When the entire thickness T1 of hard coating 30 is less than or equal to 20 m, the improvement in the characteristics of hard coating 30 tends to exhibit a significant change. From a viewpoint of improving the characteristics of hard coating 30, the entire thickness T1 of hard coating 30 is more preferably greater than or equal to 2 m and less than or equal to 15 m, and still more preferably greater than or equal to 3 m and less than or equal to 10 m.     <Coating>    [0081]    Coating 50 may include films other than hard coating 30. The films other than hard coating 30 included in coating 50 may include, in addition to substrate film 20 described above, for example, a film formed of a compound of at least one selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, and Hf and at least one selected from the group consisting of N, O, C, B, CN, BN, CO, and NO. Coating 50 may also include at least one of an -Al2O3film and a -Al2O3film as an oxidation resistant film. For example, coating 50 may include a film other than hard coating 30 as the outermost film at the top surface. However, coating 50 does not have to include substrate film 20.     [0082]    An entire thickness T2 of coating 50 is preferably greater than or equal to 3 m and less than or equal to 30 m. When entire thickness T2 of coating 50 is greater than or equal to 3 m, the characteristics of coating 50 tend to be suitably exerted. When the entire thickness T2 of coating 50 is less than or equal to 30 m, peeling of coating 50 during cutting work tends to be preventable. From a viewpoint of allowing the characteristics of coating 50 to be suitably exerted, and preventing peeling of coating 50 during cutting, the entire thickness T2 of coating 50 is more preferably greater than or equal to 5 m and less than or equal to 20 m, and still more preferably greater than or equal to 7 m and less than or equal to 15 m.     <Functions and Advantages>    [0083]    Hard coating 30 of the embodiment includes at least two first crystalline phases 21 of a laminate structure having Ti1-x1Alx1N (0.5  x1  0.75) phase 21a having a NaCl-type crystal structure and Alx2Ti1-x2N (0.75 < x2  0.95) phase 21b having a NaCl-type crystal structure. The laminate structure includes a region in which the Al concentration periodically changes in the stacking direction of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b. In this region, a difference between the maximum value of the A1 composition ratio x2 and the minimum value of the A1 composition ratio x1 is greater than 0.25. In addition, this laminate structure includes second crystalline phase 22 containing A1N having a wurtzite-type crystal structure disposed between two first crystalline phases 21.     [0084]    As described above, Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21 b included in first crystalline phases 21 both have cubic systems that provide excellent hardness; the laminate structure of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b being alternately stacked includes a region in which the A1 concentration periodically changes in the stacking direction of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase 21a and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase 21b; and in this region, a difference between the maximum value of the A1 composition ratio x2 and the minimum value of the A1 composition ratio x1 is greater than 0.25. These features permit hard coating 30 to exhibit excellent wear resistance. In addition, due to the presence of second crystalline phase 22 containing AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure that exhibits low hardness between two first crystalline phases 21, impact exerted on two first crystalline phases 21 during cutting can be alleviated by second crystalline phase 22 located between two first crystalline phases 21. Thus, life extension of a cutting tool can be achieved for the cutting tool having hard coating 30 of the embodiment.     [0085]    In addition, hard coating 30 of the embodiment is formed only by forming AlyTi1-yN on the base member in ejection step (S10), cooling base member 11 to a temperature higher than or equal to 700C and lower than or equal to 750C at a cooling rate higher than 10C/min in first cooling step (S20), followed by maintaining the base member at a temperature higher than or equal to 700C and lower than or equal to 750C in maintenance step (S30) to form the first crystalline phases, and then cooling the base member at a cooling rate lower than that of first cooling step (S20) in second cooling step (S40). It is believed that even the idea of using such two cooling steps having different cooling rates for forming a hard coating is not obvious to those skilled in the art. That is to say, from a viewpoint of manufacturing efficiency, a hard coating is usually manufactured by using only one cooling step, for example, as described in PTD 2. It is also believed that the two cooling steps of the embodiment result in formation of a structure including second crystalline phase 22 having low hardness between two first crystalline phases 21 having high hardness, and the fact that this structure leads to life extension of the cutting tool, are far from obvious to those skilled in the art.     EXAMPLES    [0086]    The thickness of each film of a coating presented below is determined by observing a cross section of the coating by high-angle annular dark-field scanning STEM using STEM. The composition of each film of the coating presented below is obtained by three-dimensional atom probe field ion microscopic analysis. The existence of the first crystalline phases and the second crystalline phase in the hard coating described below is verified by an observation using a TEM. The minimum value of Al composition ratio x1 of the Ti1x1Alx1N phase and the maximum value of Al composition ratio x2 of the Alx2Ti1-x2N phase presented below are calculated by EDX. A value of ((maximum value of x2) - (minimum value of xl)) presented below is calculated by obtaining the difference between the maximum value of Al composition ratio x2 of the Alx2Ti1-x2N phase and the minimum value of A1 composition ratio x1 of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase. An average total thickness, presented below, of the Ti1-x1Alx1N phases and the Alx2Ti1-x2N phases located next to each other in the hard coating is calculated by first obtaining the per-phase thicknesses of the Ti1-x1Alx1N phases and the per-phase thicknesses of the Alx2Ti1-x2N phases located next to each other through observation using a TEM, and then calculating the average value of the total thicknesses thereof. An electron diffraction image pattern presented below is an electron diffraction image pattern obtained from an electron diffraction image using a TEM of the second crystalline phase of the hard coating. A value of P1/(P1 + P2) presented below is calculated from a diffraction intensity P1 of a (200) plane of the Alx2Ti1-x2N phase and a diffraction intensity P2 of a (100) plane of the second crystalline phase in an XRD pattern of the hard coating. A hardness of the hard coating presented below is an indentation hardness (Hv) of the hard coating determined by a nanoindentation method using a nanoindentation hardness tester manufactured by ELIONIX Inc. The absolute values of compressive residual stress of the Alx2Ti1-x2N phase presented below are calculated by a sin<2> method using an X-ray stress measurement apparatus.     <Production of Cutting Tool>    Preparation of Base Member    [0087]    First, base members K and base members L shown in Table 1 below are prepared as the base members for forming the coatings. Specifically, raw material powders having the blend compositions (% by mass) presented in Table 1 are mixed uniformly. The term ""remainder"" in Table 1 indicates that WC accounts for the rest of the blend composition (% by mass). Next, this powder mixture is pressure formed into a predetermined shape, followed by sintering at a temperature of from 1300C to 1500C for one to two hours to obtain base members K (base member model: CNMG120408NUX) and base members L (base member model: SEET13T3AGSN-G) both formed of cemented carbide.     [0088]    The two base member models CNMG120408NUX and SEET13T3AGSN-G are products of Sumitomo Electric Hardmetal Corp. CNMG120408NUX is a model of indexable cutting insert for turning, and SEET13T3AGSN-G is a model of indexable cutting insert for rotary cutting (milling).[Table 1] Base memberK5.00.20.300remainderL10.0000.12.0remainder    Production of Coating: Samples Nos. 1 to 18    [0089]    By forming a substrate film, a hard coating, and an outermost film as shown in the ""coating configuration"" column of Table 2 on the surface of base member K or base member L, a coating is formed on the surface of base member K or base member L to produce cutting tools (samples Nos. 1 to 18). The cutting tools of samples Nos. 1 to 14 are examples, and the cutting tools of samples Nos. 15 to 18 are comparative examples.[Table 2] 1KTiN(0.5)-TiCN(2.5)a(6.0)-9.02KTiN(0.5)-TiCN(2.5)b (5.0)-8.03KTiN(0.5)-TiCN(2.5)c(6.0)-9.04KTiN(0.5)-TiCN(2.5)d (5.5)-8.55KTiN(1.0)e(9.0)-10.06KTiN(1.0)a(10.0)TiBNO(0.3)-Al2O3(1.0)12.37KTiN(1.0)b (9.5)TiCNO(0.3)-Al2O3(1.0)11.88LTiN(0.5)-TiCN(2.5)c (4.0)-7.09LTiN(0.5)-TiCN(2.5)d(5.0)-8.010LTiN(0.5)-TiCN(2.5)e(5.5)-8.511LTiN(1.0)f (4.5)-5.512LTiN(1.0)g (5.0)-6.013LTiN(1.0)f (3.0)TiBNO(0.3)-Al2O3(1.0)5.314LTiN(1.0)g (4.0)TiCNO(0.3)-Al2O3(1.0)6.315KTiN(0.5)-TiCN(2.5)h(6.0)-9.016KTiN(1.0)i(10.0)TiCNO(0.3)-Al2O3(1.0)12.317LTiN(1.0)h(4.0)-5.018LTiN(1.0)i(4.0)TiCNO(0.3)-Al2O3(1.0)6.3    [0090]    In Table 2, a substrate film is a film in direct contact with the base member; a hard coating is a film formed on the substrate film; and an outermost film is a film formed on the hard coating, and exposed to the outside. The description of compounds of Table 2 represents the compounds that form the substrate film, hard coating, and outermost film of Table 2, and a number in parentheses right to a compound name refers to the thickness of the film. When two compounds are shown in one cell of Table 2 (e.g., ""TiN(0.5)-TiCN(2.5)""), the compound on the left (""TiN(0.5)"") refers to the film proximate to the surface of the base member, while the compound on the right (""TiCN(2.5)"") refers to the film distant from the surface of the base member. The numbers in parentheses refer to the thicknesses of the respective films. Cells with symbols ""-"" of Table 2 indicate that such films are not present.     [0091]    For example, the cutting tool of sample No. 1 in Table 2 refers to a cutting tool that has a coating including a TiN film having a thickness of 0.5 m and a TiCN film having a thickness of 2.5 m that are sequentially stacked on the surface of base member K to form a substrate film; a hard coating having a thickness of 6.0 m formed on the substrate film under a formation condition set a described later herein; and no outermost film formed on the hard coating. In addition, this cutting tool has a thickness of the entire coating of 9.0 m.     [0092]    The substrate films and the outermost films shown in Table 2 are films formed by a conventionally known CVD method. The formation condition sets are shown in Table 3. For example, the row of ""TiN (substrate film)"" of Table 3 shows the formation condition set of the TiN film as the substrate film. The description on the TiN film (substrate film) of Table 3 indicates that a base member is placed in a reaction vessel of the CVD apparatus (environment in the reaction vessel: 6.7 kPa and 915C), and a mixed gas consisting of 2% by volume of TiCl4gas, 39.7% by volume of N2gas, and the remaining 58.3% by volume of H2gas is ejected into the reaction vessel having an atmosphere at a pressure of 6.7 kPa and a temperature of 915C at a flow rate of 44.7 L/min. The thickness of each film formed under each formation condition set is controlled by the time period during which each reactant gas is ejected.[Table 3] TiNTiCl4=2.0%, N2=39.7%, H2=remainder6.791544.7TiCNTiCl4=2.0%, CH3CN=0.7%, H2=remainder986035.4TiBNOTiCl4=36.7%, BCl3=0.1%, CO=1.6%, CO2=1.7%, N2=61.7%, H2=remainder6.798056.2TiCNOTiCl4=2.1%, CO=3.2%, CH4=2.8%, N2=23.7%, H2=remainder16.0103049.4Al2O3AlCl3=1.6%, CO2=4.5%, H2S=0.2%, HCl=3.5%, H2=remainder6.7100032.3    [0093]    The hard coatings shown in Table 2 are produced using CVD apparatus 10 shown in Fig. 4 under one of formation condition sets a to i shown in Tables 4 and 5. For example, the description of formation condition set a in Tables 4 and 5 represents the formation of a hard coating as follows.     [0094]    First, AlyTi1-yN is formed on the base member under the conditions of the base member temperature (820C), the pressure in reaction vessel (1.5 kPa), the total gas flow rate (50 L/min), and the gas composition (TiCl4: 0.2% by volume, AlCl3: 0.7% by volume, NH3: 2.8% by volume, HCl: 0.3% by volume, N2: 35.4% by volume, and H2: remainder) as shown in row a of Table 4, followed by performing the first cooling step of cooling the base member to 750C at a cooling rate of 15C/min shown in Table 5. Thereafter, the maintenance step of maintaining the base member at 750C for 90 minutes is performed, and then the second cooling step of cooling the base member to 400C at a cooling rate of 8C/min is performed.     [0095]    The hard coatings of samples Nos. 1 to 14 shown in Table 2 formed as described above each include at least two first crystalline phases of a laminate structure having a Ti1-x1Alx1N (0.5  x1  0.75) phase having a NaCl-type crystal structure and an Alx2Ti1-x2N (0.75 < x2  0.95) phase having a NaCl-type crystal structure that are alternately stacked, and a second crystalline phase containing AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure disposed between the two first crystalline phases. In each of the hard coatings of samples Nos. 1 to 14 shown in Table 2, the laminate structure includes a region in which the Al concentration periodically changes along the stacking direction of Ti1-x1Alx1N phase and Alx2Ti1-x2N phase; and in this region, a difference between the maximum value of the A1 composition ratio x2 and the minimum value of the A1 composition ratio x1 is greater than 0.25. Note that Table 6 shows the minimum values of A1 composition ratio x1 of the Ti1-x1Alx1N (0.5  x1  0.75) phases and the maximum values of A1 composition ratio x2 of the Alx2Ti1-x2N (0.75 < x2  0.95) phases in the hard coatings of samples Nos. 1 to 14.     [0096]    The description of formation condition set h in Tables 4 and 5 represents formation of a hard coating in the following manner.     [0097]    First, AlyTi1-yN is formed on the base member under the conditions of the base member temperature (800C), the pressure in reaction vessel (3 kPa), the total gas flow rate (60 L/min), and the gas composition (TiCl4: 0.15% by volume, AlCl3: 0.9% by volume, NH3: 3.3% by volume, HCl: 0% by volume, N2: 40% by volume, and H2: remainder) as shown in row h of Table 4. Thereafter, the base member is cooled to 400C at a cooling rate of 3.5C/min shown in Table 5.     [0098]    In the hard coatings of samples Nos. 15 and 17 shown in Table 2 formed as described above, Ti1-x1Alx1N (0.5  x1  0.75) phases each having a NaCl-type crystal structure are not formed, but Alx2Ti1-x2N (0.75 < x2  0.95) phases each having a NaCl-type crystal structure, and second crystalline phases each containing AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure are formed. Note that Table 6 shows a value of 0.85 as the maximum value of Al composition ratio x2 of the Alx2Ti1-x2N (0.5 < x2  0.95) phases of the hard coatings of samples Nos. 15 and 17.     [0099]    The description of formation condition set i in Tables 4 and 5 represents formation of a hard coating in the following manner.     [0100]    First, AlyTi1-yN is formed on the base member under the conditions of the base member temperature (800C), the pressure in reaction vessel (1 kPa), the total gas flow rate (60 L/min), and the gas composition (TiCl4: 0.25% by volume, AlCl3: 0.65% by volume, NH3: 2.7% by volume, HCl: 0% by volume, N2: 40% by volume, and H2: remainder) as shown in row i of Table 4. Thereafter, the base member is cooled to 400C at a cooling rate of 10C/min shown in Table 5.     [0101]    In the hard coatings of samples Nos. 16 and 18 shown in Table 2 formed as described above, only the first crystalline phases each including a structure having a Th1-x1Alx1N (0.1  x1  0.5) phase having a NaCl-type crystal structure and an Alx2Ti1-x2N (0.5 < x2  0.95) phase having a NaCl-type crystal structure that are alternately stacked are formed, and second crystalline phases each containing AlN having a wurtzite-type crystal structure are not formed. Note that Table 6 shows a value of 0.25 as the minimum value of A1 composition ratio x1 of the Ti1-x1Alx1N (0.1  x1  0.5) phases and a value of 0.95 as the maximum value of A1 composition ratio x2 of the Alx2Ti1-x2N (0.5<x20.95) phases, of the hard coatings of samples Nos. 16 and 18.     [0102]    Table 6 shows properties of the hard coatings formed under the formation condition sets a to i of Table 4.[Table 4] a8201.5500.200.702.80.3035 4remainder3.5b8201.5550.150.903.30.3535.4remainder6.0c8502.0600.300.602.70.2535.4remainder2.0d8502.0600.300.602.702535.4remainder2.0e8502.0600.300.602.70.2535.4remainder2.0f8602.5600.600.302.60.2035.4remainder0.5g8201.0500.500.502.90.2235.4remainder1.0h8003600.150.903.3040remainder6.0i8001600.250.652.7040remainder2.6[Table 5] a15750908b15750408c15750307d1575018010e15700608f1575024010g1575030010h3.5n/an/an/ai10n/an/an/a[Table 6] a0.580.930.3522concentric0.8734 20.6 (compressive)b0.630.950.3220concentric0.8133.50.6 (compressive)c0.510.850.3426concentric0.6031.80.9 (compressive)d0.580.850.2729concentric0.5031.01.0 (compressive)e0.530.860.3323concentric0.6732.70.7 (compressive)f0.640.900.2638concentric0.2429.51.3 (compressive)g0.670.920.2533concentric0.4030.21.2 (compressive)h-0.85not measurablenot measurabledot0.728.71.3 (compressive)i0.250.950.78not measurablenot calculable35.507 (tensile)    <Cutting test>    [0103]    Cutting tests 1 to 4 are performed using the cutting tools of samples Nos. 1 to 18 produced as described above.     Cutting test 1: High-speed outer periphery cutting test of round bar    [0104]    The cutting tools of samples Nos. 1 to 7, 15, and 16 are used to determine the cutting times required for the amount of flank wear (Vb) to reach 0.20 mm under the cutting conditions of cutting test 1 described below, and the final damage forms of the cutting edges are observed. The results are shown in Table 7.     [0105]    Note that the higher the value in a cell of cutting time in Tables 7 to 10 is, the longer the life of the cutting tool is. The description of final form of damage in Tables 7 to 10 represents wear resistance of the coating using the terms of wear, chipping, and fracture in descending order. In regard to final form of damage in Tables 7 to 10, the term ""wear"" means a form of damage only with wear and without chipping or fracturing damage (having a smooth worn surface); the term ""chipping"" means a small fracturing damage present on a cutting edge portion for forming a finished surface; and the term ""fracture"" means a large fracturing damage present on a cutting edge portion.

BACKGROUND    [0002]    Resins for extrusion coating on paper, board, aluminum etc, are designed with broad MWD (molecular weight distribution) and low extractables. In extrusion coating application the polymer is processed at high temperature conditions, typically above 280C and below 350C. Broad MWD (high molecular weight fraction) is necessary for good processability during coating (neck-in and draw down balance), while low extractables are needed for low smoke formation during coating, at high temperature conditions, and or for food contact compliance. Broad MWD LDPE (low density polyethylene) is made up of low and high molecular weight polymer molecules, and an average molecular weight will determine the melt index. The extractable fraction increases with an increasing fraction of low molecular weight molecules, and is enhanced by increasing short chain branching frequency at low molecular weight molecules. In view of this combination of features, there is typically a trade-off between coating performance and extractable level.     [0003]    Typically LDPE resins with broad MWD are made on autoclave or combination of autoclave and tube reactors. Broad MWD resins can be achieved in autoclave reactor systems by promoting long chain branching and through the inherent residence time distribution by which molecules will undergo shorter (low molecular weight) or longer (high molecular weight) growth paths.     [0004]    The autoclave and tubular reactor systems differ from each other in respect to residence time distribution, typically uniform for tubular and dispersed for autoclave reactor zones, while polymerization conditions like temperature, pressure and polymer concentrations vary widely in tubular reactor systems and are uniform or are less differentiated for autoclave reactor systems. The uniform residence time in tubular reactor conditions leads to narrower MWD, therefore broad MWD can only be achieved in tubular reactors by applying extremely differentiated polymerization conditions. These extremely differentiated polymerization conditions lead to higher extractable level by formation of polymer molecules with lower molecular weight and/or increased short chain branching level in the low molecular weight fraction. However, an autoclave process typically operates at lower conversion levels, and is more capital/energy intensive than a tubular process.     [0005]    Thus, there is a need for new ethylene-based polymers with broad MWD and low extractables, suitable for extrusion coating application, and which can be made in a tubular process. There is a further need for such polymers that can be prepared without any chemical modification, for instance the use of cross-linking agents in reactors, separators, extruders, etc., or the use of blending operations.     [0006]    International Publication No. WO 2007/110127 discloses an extrusion coating composition comprising an ethylene copolymer. The ethylene copolymer is obtained by a polymerization that takes place in a tubular reactor at a peak temperature between 300C and 350C. The comonomer is a bifunctional ,-alkadiene, which is capable of acting as a crosslinking agent.     [0007]    International Publication No. WO 2006/094723 discloses a process for the preparation of a copolymer of ethylene and a monomer copolymerizable therewith. The polymerization takes place in a tubular reactor at a peak temperature between 290C and 350C. The comonomer is a di-or higher functional (meth) acrylate, and the comonomer is used in an amount between 0.008 mol% and 0.200 mol%, relative to the amount of ethylene copolymer. The di-or higher functional (meth) acrylate is capable of acting as a crosslinking agent.     [0008]    European Patent EP 0928797B1 discloses an ethylene homo or copolymer having a density of between 0.923 and 0.935 g/cc, and a molecular weight distribution Mw/Mn between 3 and 10, and comprising from 0.10 to 0.50 wt% of units derived from a carbonyl group containing compound, based on the total weight of the homopolymer or copolymer.     [0009]    DD276598A3 (English Translation) discloses a process for adjusting and regulating the input gas streams for multizone tubular reactors, with at least two side input streams, for the production of ethylene polymers, by free-radical bulk polymerization. The polymerization takes place at pressures above 80 MPa, temperatures from 373 to 623K, and in the presence of 10 to 50 ppm of oxygen, as polymerization initiator.     [0010]    U.S. Patent 3,334,081 discloses a continuous process for the production of polymers of ethylene as carried out in a tubular reactor, whereby the polymer is obtained at a higher conversion rate. In one embodiment, this patent discloses a continuous process for the polymerization of ethylene in a tubular reactor at a pressure of at least about 15,000 p.s.i.g., and a temperature from about 90C to about 350C, in the presence of a free radical initiator.     [0011]    U.S. Patent 3,657,212 discloses a production of ethylene homopolymers having a specific density, by polymerization of ethylene, under the action of organic peroxides and oxygen as free-radical-generating polymerization initiators, and of polymerization modifiers, at elevated temperature and superatmospheric pressure, in a tubular reactor having two successive reaction zones. A mixture of ethylene, polymerization initiator, and polymerization modifier are introduced continuously at the beginning of each reaction zone. The ethylene homopolymers have a broad molecular weight distribution, and are said to be practically devoid of very high molecular weight constituents.     [0012]    DD120200 (English Translation) discloses a process for producing homopolymers of ethylene with a bulk density of 0.912 to 0.922 g/cc, in tubular reactors, by polymerization of ethylene with free-radical forming initiators. The polymerization is carried out in the absence of chain regulators, and at maximum reactor temperatures of 250 to 340C, and at pressures of 1000 to 2000 atm, and with multifunctional peroxides.     [0013]    CA2541180 discloses polymer blends composed of from 25 to 75 wt% homopolymer produced in a tubular reactor, and 75 to 25 wt% of ethylene homopolymer in a high pressure autoclave reactor, provided that each homopolymer is removed from the reaction zone prior to being blended together. The blends so formed are said to have a good combination of neck-in and adhesion properties.     [0014]    Two-zone tubular reactor systems, commonly used in the above art, lead to polymers with either too narrow MWD or too high extractable level (also see LDPE 160C in Table 4, which is also produced in two-zoned tubular reactor). Achieving broad MWD resins with these reactor systems typically require extremely high peak temperatures and/or low reactor inlet pressures, leading to formation of lower molecular weight material with increased short chain branching level, which leads to high extractables.

Bosch, ""The Introduction of Tubular LDPE to the Extrusion Coating Market and the Specifics of the Product,"" 12th TAPPI European PLACE conference, 2009, 1-20 .     [0016]    Conventional tubular polymerization processes of the art typically produce broad MWD polymers with high levels of extractables. Thus, there remains a need for new ethylene-based polymers, such as LDPE resins, with broad MWD and low extractables. These needs and others have been met by the following invention.

[0022]    The following embodiments apply to both the first and second aspects of the invention, as described above.     [0023]    The ethylene-based polymer may comprise a combination of two or more embodiments as described herein.     [0024]    As used herein, the G' value noted above is G' for G"" = 500 Pa (at 170C).

[0026]    In one embodiment, the ethylene-based polymer further comprises a chloroform extractable (Clext) level  7.8 wt% (wt% = weight percent).     [0027]    In one embodiment, the polymer has a ""weight fraction (w) of molecular weight greater than 10<6>g/mole, based on the total weight of polymer, and as determined by GPC(abs)"" that meets the following relationship: w < I + J(I2), where I = 0.080, and J = -4.00 x 10<-3>min/dg.

In a further embodiment, the ethylene-based polymer comprises less than 30 ppm of a comonomer containing multiple unsaturations or containing an acetylenic functionality.

In another embodiment, the article is a film.     [0065]    An inventive article may comprise a combination of two or more embodiments as described herein.     Polymerizations    [0066]    For a high pressure, free radical initiated polymerization process, two basic types of reactors are known. The first type is an agitated autoclave vessel having one or more reaction zones (the autoclave reactor). The second type is a jacketed tube which has one or more reaction zones (the tubular reactor).     [0067]    The pressure in each autoclave and tubular reactor zone of the process is typically from 100 to 400, more typically from 120 to 360, and even more typically from 150 to 320 MPa.     [0068]    The polymerization temperature in each tubular reactor zone of the process is typically from 100 to 400, more typically from 130 to 360, and even more typically from 140 to 330C.     [0069]    The polymerization temperature in each autoclave reactor zone of the process is typically from 150 to 300, more typically from 165 to 290, and even more typically from 180 to 280C. One skilled in the art understands that the temperatures in the autoclave are considerably lower and less differentiated than those of the tubular reactor, and thus, more favorable extractable levels are typically observed in polymers produced in an autoclave-based reactor systems.     [0070]    The high pressure process of the present invention to produce polyethylene homo or interpolymers having the advantageous properties as found in accordance with the invention, is preferably carried out in a tubular reactor having at least three reaction zones.     Initiators    [0071]    The process of the present invention is a free radical polymerization process. The type of free radical initiator to be used in the present process is not critical, but preferably one of the initiators applied should allow high temperature operation in the range from 300C to 350C. Free radical initiators that are generally used include organic peroxides, such as peresters, perketals, peroxy ketones, percarbonates and cyclic multifunctional peroxides. These organic peroxy initiators are used in conventional amounts, typically from 0.005 to 0.2 wt%, based on the weight of polymerizable monomers. Peroxides are typically injected as diluted solutions in a suitable solvent, for example, in a hydrocarbon solvent.     [0072]    Other suitable initiators include azodicarboxylic esters, azodicarboxylic dinitriles and 1,1,2,2-tetramethylethane derivatives, and other components capable of forming free radicals in the desired operating temperature range.     [0073]    In one embodiment, an initiator is added to at least one reaction zone of the polymerization, and wherein the initiator has a ""half-life temperature at one second"" greater than 255C, preferably greater than 260C. In a further embodiment, such initiators are used at a peak polymerization temperature from 320C to 350C. In a further embodiment, the initiator comprises at least one peroxide group incorporated in a ring structure.     [0074]    Examples of such initiators include, but are not limited to, TRIGONOX 301 (3,6,9-triethyl-3,6,9-trimethyl-1,4,7-triperoxonaan) and TRIGONOX 311 (3,3,5,7,7-pentamethyl-1,2,4-trioxepane), both available from Akzo Nobel, and HMCH-4-AL (3,3,6,6,9,9-hexamethyl-1,2,4,5-tetroxonane) available from United Initiators. See also International Publication Nos. WO 02/14379 and WO 01/68723 .     Chain Transfer Agents (CTA)    [0075]    Chain transfer agents or telogens are used to control the melt index in a polymerization process. Chain transfer involves the termination of growing polymer chains, thus limiting the ultimate molecular weight of the polymer material. Chain transfer agents are typically hydrogen atom donors that will react with a growing polymer chain and stop the polymerization reaction of the chain. These agents can be of many different types, from saturated hydrocarbons or unsaturated hydrocarbons to aldehydes, ketones or alcohols. By controlling the concentration of the selected chain transfer agent, one can control the length of polymer chains, and, hence the molecular weight, for example, the number average molecular weight, Mn. The melt flow index (MFI or I2) of a polymer, which is related to Mn, is controlled in the same way.     [0076]    The chain transfer agents used in the process of this invention include, but are not limited to, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as, for example, pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, propene, pentene or hexane; ketones such as acetone, diethyl ketone or diamyl ketone; aldehydes such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde; and saturated aliphatic aldehyde alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol or butanol.     [0077]    A further way to influence the melt-index includes the build up and control, in the ethylene recycle streams, of incoming ethylene impurities, like methane and ethane, peroxide dissociation products, like tert-butanol, acetone, etc., and or solvent components used to dilute the initiators. These ethylene impurities, peroxide dissociation products and/or dilution solvent components can act as chain transfer agents.     Polymers    [0078]    In one embodiment, the ethylene-based polymers of this invention have a density from 0.914 to 0.940, more typically from 0.916 to 0.930 and even more typically from 0.918 to 0.926, grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc or g/cm<3>). In one embodiment, the ethylene-based polymers of this invention have a melt index (I2) from 2 to 20, more typically from 2 to 15 and even more typically from 2 to 10, grams per 10 minutes (g/10 min) at 190C/2.16 kg.     [0079]    Ethylene-based polymers include LDPE homopolymer, and high pressure copolymers, including ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA), ethylene ethyl acrylate (EEA), ethylene butyl acrylate (EBA), ethylene acrylic acid (EAA), and ethylene carbon monoxide (ECO). Other suitable comonomers are described in Ehrlich, P.; Mortimer, G.A.; Adv. Polymer Science; Fundamentals of Free-radical Polymerization of Ethylene; Vol. 7, pp.386-448 (1970 ). In one embodiment, comonomers exclude comonomers capable of crosslinking polymer chains, for instance containing multiple unsaturations or an acetylenic functionality.     Monomer and Comonomers    [0080]    The term ethylene interpolymer as used in the present description, and the claims, refers to polymers of ethylene and one or more comonomers. Suitable comonomers to be used in the ethylene polymers of the present invention include, but are not limited to, ethylenically unsaturated monomers and especially C3-20alpha-olefins, carbon monoxide, vinyl acetate, and C2-6alkyl acrylates. In one embodiment, the ethylene-based polymer does not contain comonomers capable of crosslinking polymer chains, for instance comonomers containing multiple unsaturations or containing an acetylenic functionality.     Blends    [0081]    The inventive polymers can be blended with one or more other polymers, such as, but not limited to, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE); copolymers of ethylene with one or more alpha-olefins, such as, but not limited to, propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methylpentene-1, pentene-1, hexene-1 and octene-1; high density polyethylene (HDPE), such as HDPE grades HD 940-970 available from The Dow Chemical Company. The amount of inventive polymer in the blend can vary widely, but typically it is from 10 to 90, or from 15 to 85, or from 20 to 80, weight percent, based on the weight of the polymers in the blend. The LDPE (inventive)/LLDPE blends typically provide good optics, and/or are useful in the preparation of laminations, and/or are useful in such applications as films, extrusion coatings, foams, and wire and cables.     Additives    [0082]    One or more additives may be added to a composition comprising an inventive polymer. Suitable additives include stabilizers; fillers, such as organic or inorganic particles, including clays, talc, titanium dioxide, zeolites, powdered metals, organic or inorganic fibers, including carbon fibers, silicon nitride fibers, steel wire or mesh, and nylon or polyester cording, nano-sized particles, clays, and so forth; tackifiers, oil extenders, including paraffinic or napthelenic oils.     Applications    [0083]    An inventive composition may be employed in a variety of conventional thermoplastic fabrication processes to produce useful articles, including extrusion coatings; films; and molded articles, such as blow molded, injection molded, or rotomolded articles; foams; wire and cable, fibers, and woven or non-woven fabrics.     DEFINITIONS    [0084]    Unless stated to the contrary, implicit from the context, or customary in the art, all parts and percents are based on weight, and all test methods are current as of the filing date of this disclosure.     [0085]    The term ""composition,"" as used herein, refers to a mixture of materials which comprise the composition, as well as reaction products and decomposition products formed from the materials of the composition.     [0086]    The terms ""blend"" or ""polymer blend,"" as used, mean an intimate physical mixture (that is, without reaction) of two or more polymers. A blend may or may not be miscible (not phase separated at molecular level). A blend may or may not be phase separated. A blend may or may not contain one or more domain configurations, as determined from transmission electron spectroscopy, light scattering, x-ray scattering, and other methods known in the art. The blend may be effected by physically mixing the two or more polymers on the macro level (for example, melt blending resins or compounding) or the micro level (for example, simultaneous forming within the same reactor).     [0087]    The term ""polymer"" refers to a compound prepared by polymerizing monomers, whether of the same or a different type. The generic term polymer thus embraces the term homopolymer (which refers to polymers prepared from only one type of monomer with the understanding that trace amounts of impurities can be incorporated into the polymer structure), and the term ""interpolymer"" as definedinfra.    [0088]    The term ""interpolymer"" refers to polymers prepared by the polymerization of at least two different types of monomers. The generic term interpolymer includes copolymers (which refers to polymers prepared from two different monomers), and polymers prepared from more than two different types of monomers.     [0089]    The term ""ethylene-based polymer"" or ""ethylene polymer"" refers to a polymer that comprises a majority amount of polymerized ethylene, based on the weight of the polymer and, optionally, may comprise at least one comonomer.     [0090]    The term ""ethylene-based interpolymer"" or ""ethylene interpolymer"" refers to an interpolymer that comprises a majority amount of polymerized ethylene, based on the weight of the interpolymer, and comprises at least one comonomer.     [0091]    The term ""ethylene-based copolymer"" or ""ethylene copolymer"" refers to an interpolymer that comprises a majority amount of polymerized ethylene, based on the weight of the copolymer, and only one comonomer (thus, only two monomer types).     [0092]    The terms ""autoclave-based products"" or ""autoclaved-based polymers,"" as used herein, refer to polymers prepared in an autoclave, autoclave/autoclave, or autoclaved/tubular reactor combination.     [0093]    The terms ""comprising,"" ""including,"" ""having,"" and their derivatives, are not intended to exclude the presence of any additional component, step or procedure, whether or not the same is specifically disclosed. In order to avoid any doubt, all compositions claimed through use of the term ""comprising"" may include any additional additive, adjuvant, or compound, whether polymeric or otherwise, unless stated to the contrary. In contrast, the term, ""consisting essentially of"" excludes from the scope of any succeeding recitation any other component, step or procedure, excepting those that are not essential to operability. The term ""consisting of"" excludes any component, step or procedure not specifically delineated or listed.     TEST METHODS    [0094]    Density : Samples for density measurement are prepared according to ASTM D 1928. Polymer samples are pressed at 190C and 30,000 psi for three minutes, and then at 21C and 207 MPa for one minute. Measurements are made within one hour of sample pressing using ASTM D792, Method B.     [0095]    Melt Index : Melt index, or I2, (grams/10 minutes or dg/min) is measured in accordance with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190 C/2.16 kg. I10is measured with ASTM D 1238, Condition 190 C/10 kg.     [0096]    Triple Detector Gel Permeation Chromatography (TDGPC) : High temperature TD-GPC analysis is performed on an ALLIANCE GPCV2000 instrument (Waters Corp.) set at 145C. The flow rate for the GPC is 1 mL/min. The injection volume is 218.5 L. The column set consists of four, Mixed-A columns (20-m particles; 7.5 x 300 mm; Polymer Laboratories Ltd).     [0097]    Detection is achieved by using an IR4 detector from PolymerChAR, equipped with a CH-sensor; a Wyatt Technology Dawn DSP Multi-Angle Light Scattering (MALS) detector (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA), equipped with a 30-mW argon-ion laser operating at  = 488 nm; and a Waters three-capillary viscosity detector. The MALS detector is calibrated by measuring the scattering intensity of the TCB solvent. Normalization of the photodiodes is done by injecting SRM 1483, a high density polyethylene with weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 32,100 and polydispersity (molecular weight distribution) of 1.11. A specific refractive index increment (dn/dc) of -0.104 mL/mg, for polyethylene in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), is used.     [0098]    The conventional GPC calibration is done with 20 narrow PS standards (Polymer Laboratories Ltd.) with molecular weights in the range 580-7,500,000 g/mol. The polystyrene standard peak molecular weights are converted to polyethylene molecular weights using the following equation: M polyethylene = A  M polystyrene B ,<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""395582117-ib0001"" />with A = 0.39, and B = 1. The value of A is determined by using a linear high density polyethylene homopolymer (HDPE) with Mw of 115,000 g/mol. The HDPE reference material is also used to calibrate the IR detector and viscometer by assuming 100 % mass recovery and an intrinsic viscosity of 1.873 dL/g.     [0099]    Distilled ""Baker Analyzed"" grade 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (J.T. Baker, Deventer, The Netherlands), containing 200 ppm of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (Merck, Hohenbrunn, Germany), is used as the solvent for sample preparation, as well as for the 3Det-GPC experiment. HDPE SRM 1483 is obtained from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).     [0100]    LDPE solutions are prepared by dissolving the samples under gentle stirring for three hours at 160C. The PS standards are dissolved under the same conditions for 30 minutes. The sample concentration is 1.5 mg/mL, and the polystyrene concentrations are 0.2 mg/mL.     [0101]    A MALS detector measures the scattered signal from polymers or particles in a sample under different scattering angles . The basic light scattering equation (from M. Anderson, B. Wittgren, K.-G. Wahlund, Anal. Chem. 75, 4279 (2003 )) can be written as follows: Kc R  = 1 M + 16  2 3  2 1 M Rg 2 sin 2  2 ,<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""395582117-ib0002"" />where Ris the excess Rayleigh ratio, K is an optical constant, which is, among other things, dependent on the specific refractive index increment (dn/dc), c is the concentration of the solute, M is the molecular weight, Rg is the radius of gyration, and  is the wavelength of the incident light. Calculation of the molecular weight and radius of gyration from the light scattering data require extrapolation to zero angle (see also P.J. Wyatt, Anal. Chim. Acta 272, 1 (1993)). This is done by plotting (Kc/R)<12>as a function of sin<2>(/2) in the so-called Debye plot. The molecular weight can be calculated from the intercept with the ordinate, and the radius of gyration from initial slope of the curve. The second virial coefficient is assumed to be negligible. The intrinsic viscosity numbers are calculated from both the viscosity and concentration detector signals by taking the ratio of the specific viscosity and the concentration at each elution slice.     [0102]    ASTRA 4.72 (Wyatt Technology Corp.) software is used to collect the signals from the IR detector, the viscometer, and the MALS detector, and to run the calculations.     [0103]    The calculated molecular weights, e.g. the absolute weight average molecular weight Mw(abs), and absolute molecular weight distributions (e.g., Mw(abs)/Mn(abs)) are obtained using a light scattering constant derived from one or more of the polyethylene standards mentioned and a refractive index concentration coefficient, dn/dc, of 0.104. Generally, the mass detector response and the light scattering constant should be determined from a linear standard with a molecular weight in excess of about 50,000 Daltons. The viscometer calibration can be accomplished using the methods described by the manufacturer, or alternatively, by using the published values of suitable linear standards such as Standard Reference Materials (SRM) 1475a, 1482a, 1483, or 1484a. The chromatographic concentrations are assumed low enough to eliminate addressing 2<nd>virial coefficient effects (concentration effects on molecular weight).     [0104]    The obtained MWD(abs) curve from TD-GPC is summarized with three characteristic parameters: the absolute weight average molecular weight Mw(abs), the absolute number average molecular weight Mn(abs), and w, where w is defined as ""weight fraction of molecular weight greater than 10<6>g/mole, based on the total weight of polymer, and as determined by GPC(abs).""     [0105]    Figure 6 shows the MWD(abs) for comparative example PT7007 and inventive example 3. In addition, a vertical line, as shown in this figure, indicates the lower integration limit to determine ""w."" Thus, ""w"" effectively is the area under the curve to the right of this vertical line.     [0106]    In equation form, the parameters are determined as follows. Numerical integration from the table of ""logM"" and ""dw/dlogM"" is typically done with the trapezoidal rule: Mw abs =     M dw dlogM dlogM ,<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""395582117-ib0003"" />Mn abs = 1     1 dW M dlogM dlogM , and<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""395582117-ib0004"" />w =  6  dw dlogM dlogM<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""395582117-ib0005"" />    Rheological G'    [0107]    The sample used in the G' measurement was prepared from a compression molding plaque. A piece of aluminum foil was placed on a backplate, and a template or mold was placed on top of the backplate. Approximately 12 grams of resin was placed in the mold, and a second piece of aluminum foil was placed over the resin and mold. A second backplate was then placed on top of the aluminum foil. The total ensemble was put into a compression molding press, which was run at the following conditions: 3 min at 150C, at 10 bar pressure, followed by 1 min at 150C, at 150 bar, followed by a ""1.5 min"" quench cooling to room temperature, at 150 bar. A 25 mm disk was stamped out of the compression-molded plaque. The thickness of this disk was approximately 2.0 mm.     [0108]    The rheology measurement to determine G' was done in a nitrogen environment, at 170C, and a strain of 10%. The stamped-out disk was placed between the two ""25 mm"" parallel plates located in an ARES-1 (Rheometrics SC) rheometer oven, which was preheated, for at least 30 minutes, at 170C, and the gap of the ""25 mm"" parallel plates was slowly reduced to 1.65 mm. The sample was then allowed to remain for exactly 5 minutes at these conditions. The oven was then opened, the excess sample was carefully trimmed around the edge of the plates, and the oven was closed. The storage modulus and loss modulus of the sample were measured via a small amplitude, oscillatory shear, according to a decreasing frequency sweep from 100 to 0.1 rad/s (when able to obtain a G"" value lower than 500 Pa at 0.1 rad/s), or from 100 to 0.01 rad/s. For each frequency sweep, 10 points (logarithmically spaced) per frequency decade were used.     [0109]    The data were plotted (G' (Y-axis) versus G"" (X-axis)) on a log-log scale. The Y-axis scale covered the range from 10 to 1000 Pa, while the X-axis scale covered the range from 100 to 1000 Pa. The Orchestrator software was used to select the data in the region where G"" was between 200 and 800 Pa (or using at least 4 data points). The data were fit to a log polynomial model using the fit equation Y = C1+C2 ln(x). Using the Orchestrator software, G' at G"" equal to 500 Pa was determined by interpolation.     [0110]    In some cases, the G' (at a G"" of 500 Pa) was determined from test temperatures of 150C and 190C. The value at 170C was calculated from a linear interpolation from the values at these two temperatures.     Standard Method for Hexane Extractable    [0111]    Polymer pellets (from the polymerization, pelletization process without further modification approximately 2.2 grams of pellets pressed into a film) were pressed in a Carver Press, at a thickness of 3.0 - 4.0 mils. The pellets were pressed at 190C, for three minutes, at 3,000 lbf, and then at 190C, for three minutes, at 40,000 lbf. Non-residue gloves (PIP* CleanTeam* Cotton Lisle Inspection Gloves, Part Number: 97-501) were worn, so as to not contaminate films with residual oils from the hands of the operator. Films were cut into ""1 inch x 1 inch"" squares, and weighed. Enough film samples were used, such that ""2.5g"" of film samples were used for each extraction. The films were then extracted for two hours, in a hexane vessel containing about 1000 ml of hexane, at ""49.5  0.5C"" in a heated water bath. The hexane used was an isomeric ""hexanes"" mixture (for example, Hexanes (Optima), Fisher Chemical, High purity mobile phase for HPLC and/or extraction solvent for GC applications, 99.9% min by GC). After two hours, the films were removed, rinsed in clean hexane, initially dried with nitrogen and then further dried in a vacuum oven (80  5C) at full vacuum (ISOTEMP Vacuum Oven, Model 281A at approximately 30 inches Hg) for two hours. The films were then placed in a desiccator, and allowed to cool to room temperature for a minimum of one hour. The films were then reweighed, and the amount of mass loss due to extraction in hexane was calculated.     Standard Method for Chloroform Extractable    [0112]    A FOSS SOXTEC Avanti 2050 automatic extraction system, with control unit 2050 and drive unit 2050, was used for chloroform extraction. Chloroform with a purity of at least 99% (J.T. Baker code 7386 or equivalent) was used. An amount of 6-8 grams of pellets (from the polymerization pelletization without further modification; 25-45 pellets per gram) was weighed into a crucible; 180 mL of solvent (chloroform) was added, and the sample was boiled at a set temperature of 180C for a boil time of 3.5 hours. The pellets were submersed in the boiling solvent during the boiling time. After the boiling step, a rinsing step of 3.5 hours was used. The rinse solvent was chloroform. The samples were lifted above the surface of the boiling solvent, which condensed and refluxed back into the crucible; in the mean time, the pellet sample was rinsed at a rate of about 180 drops per minute. After the rinsing step, the chloroform solvent in the crucible was partly recovered by the instrument for further use. The solvent remaining in the crucible was evaporated , and the polymer extract was retained and measured.      EXPERIMENTAL      Example C (Comparative)     [0113]    The polymerization was carried out in tubular reactor with three reaction zones. In each reaction zone, pressurized water was used for cooling and/or heating the reaction medium, by circulating this water through the jacket of the reactor. The inlet-pressure was 2100 bar, and the pressure drop over the whole tubular reactor system was about 300 bars Each reaction zone had one inlet and one outlet. Each inlet stream consisted of the outlet stream from the previous reaction zone and/or an added ethylene-rich feed stream. The ethylene was supplied according to a specification, which allowed a trace amount (maximum of 5 mol ppm) of acetylene in the ethylene. Thus, the maximum, potential amount of incorporated acetylene in the polymer is less than, or equal to, 16 mole ppm, based on the total moles of monomeric units in the ethylene-based polymer (see conversion level in Table 3). The non-converted ethylene, and other gaseous components in the reactor outlet, were recycled through a high pressure and a low pressure recycles, and were compressed and distributed through a booster, a primary and a hyper (secondary) compressors, according flow scheme shown in Figure 1 . Organic peroxides (see Table 3) were fed into each reaction zone. Propionaldehyde (PA) was used as a chain transfer agent, and it was present in each reaction zone inlet originated from the low pressure and high pressure recycle flows (#13 and #15), as well as from freshly injected CTA make-up stream #7 and/or stream #6. In this comparative example, the weight ratio between the ""CTA make up"" streams #7 and #6 was 0.25.     [0114]    After reaching the first peak temperature (maximum temperature) in reaction zone 1, the reaction medium was cooled with the aid of the pressurized water. At the outlet of reaction zone 1, the reaction medium was further cooled by injecting a fresh, cold, ethylene-rich feed stream (#20), and the reaction was re-initiated by feeding an organic peroxide. This process was repeated at the end of the second reaction zone to enable further polymerization in the third reaction zone. The polymer was extruded and pelletized (about 30 pellets per gram), using a single screw extruder at a melt temperature around 230-250C. The weight ratio of the ethylene-rich feed streams to the three reaction zones was 1.00:0.75:0.25. The R2 and R3 values were each 0.45. The R values are calculated according to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/548996 (International Application No. PCT/US12/059469 ). Rn (n = reaction zone number, n>1) is the ratio of ""mass fraction of fresh ethylene fed to the first reaction zone (RZ1)"" to ""mass fraction of fresh ethylene fed to the nth reaction zone (RZn)"" is (Rn = RZ1/RZn). The internal process velocity was approximately 12.5, 9 and 11 m/sec for respectively the 1<st>, 2<nd>and 3<rd>reaction zone. Additional information can be found in Tables 2 and 3.      Example E (Comparative)     [0115]    The polymerization was carried out in tubular reactor with three reaction zones, as discussed above. All process conditions are the same as for Example C, except the initiator composition was changed. In this example, additional TETMP was used as initiator. The R2 and R3 values were each 0.46.      Example F (Comparative)     [0116]    The polymerization was carried out in tubular reactor with three reaction zones, as discussed above. The non-converted ethylene, and other gaseous components in the reactor outlet, were recycled through the high pressure and low pressure recycles, and were compressed and distributed through the booster, primary and hyper (secondary) compressors according flow scheme 2 as shown in Figure 2 .     [0117]    In each reaction zone, the polymerization was initiated with organic peroxides as described in Comparative Example E. After reaching the first peak temperature in reaction zone 1, the reaction medium was cooled down with pressurized water. At the outlet of the first reaction zone, the reaction medium was further cooled by injecting a fresh, cold ethylene-rich feed stream (#20), and the reaction was initiated again by feeding organic peroxide into the reaction zone. This process was repeated at the end of the second reaction zone, to enable further polymerization in the third reaction zone. The peak temperatures were 330C /319C /306C, respectively.     [0118]    The weight ratio of the ethylene-rich feed streams to the three reaction zones was 1.00:0.75:0.25. For the chain transfer agent, propylene was used, and it was present in each reactor inlet originating from the low and high pressure recycle flows (#13 and #15), as well as from freshly injected CTA make-up stream #7 and/or stream #6. The supplied propylene contained a trace amount of (sum maximum of 5 mol ppm) propadiene and methylacetylene in the propylene. Thus, the maximum, potential amount of incorporated propadiene and/or methylacetylene in the polymer is far less than 1 mole ppm.     [0119]    In this comparative example, the weight ratio of the CTA make-up streams #7 and #6 was 1.00. Due to the higher peak temperature conditions, the CTA consumption was significantly reduced versus Example C. The R2 and R3 values were each 2.22. Additional information can be found in Tables 2 and 3.     [0120]    See polymerization conditions for Examples A, B and G in Tables 2 and 3.      Example 1 (Inventive)     [0121]    The polymerization was run according description for Example F above, with the following changes. Last peak temperature was increased to 310C, and CTA acetone was used, and the melt index was lowered to 3.5 dg/min. The R2 and R3 values were each 2.21.      Example 3 ( Inventive )    [0122]    The polymerization was run according to the above description for Example 1 with the following changes. In this inventive example, the peak temperatures were adjusted to 337/330/310C, respectively and the melt index was increased to 5 dg/min. The R2 and R3 values were each 2.19.     [0123]    Initiators are listed in Table 1. Other polymerizations were run similar to the polymerizations above, with the changes noted in Tables 2 and 3.

[0126]    The inventive examples have the claimed balance of polymer properties. Broadened Mw(abs)/Mn(abs), high G', and low extractables, for example, low chloroform extractables, achieved at moderate Mw(abs), as compared to the comparative examples.     [0127]    Comparative examples, CE PG7004, PT7007, and PT7009, are autoclave LDPE. These examples have low extractables, but much higher Mw(abs) for the same G' level as compared to the inventive samples. For example, compare PT7007 with inventive example 3; and PT7004 with inventive example 4.     [0128]    Comparative examples LDPE 160C and SABIC NEXCOAT CE (modified with a cross linking agent) are tubular resins that do have high G' values, but are accompanied with high chloroform extractables, as compared to the inventive examples. Both also have significantly higher Mw(abs) than the inventive examples.     [0129]    Comparative examples LD410E and LD450E are for high clarity film (narrow MWD) and foam (broader MWD) applications, with low extractables. Comparative examples LD150E and LD310E are good film resins with low extractables. The rheological properties of the comparative examples are not suitable for extrusion coating applications. The inventive examples have the desired balance between G' value and melt index (I2), and are well suited for extrusion coating applications.     [0130]    Comparative examples A through F are broader tubular resins as compared to the comparative LD410E and LD450E resins mentioned above. The G' value is still lower than what was reach with the inventive examples.     [0131]    Comparative examples C and E have been made under similar polymerization conditions, except of the additional use of TETMP as high temperature peroxide in comparative example E. TETMP is a multi functional peroxide. The additional use of a multi function initiator did not lead to broadening of Mw(abs)/Mn(abs), or improved coating performance, as shown in Tables 4-6 (see also DD120200 , which teaches the use of multifunctional peroxides to broaden MWD). These tables indicate similar performance, and the small differences are within measurement accuracy.     [0132]    Comparative examples F and G have been made under similar polymerization conditions, except propylene was used in F as CTA, and acetone was used in G as CTA. The data shows that the coating performance is very slightly improved by the use of propylene; however the extractable levels are significantly higher (see also US patent 3657212 which teaches propylene as one of the two preferred CTA's). Furthermore, comparative example G is lacking the desired G' level. Inventive examples 1 to 6 have the required G' level. The G' values of these samples were improved by raising the polymerization temperatures.     [0133]    For achieving broad MWD resins, with low extractables, and the required G' value the polymerization conditions need to be optimized and balanced with other product properties like melt-index, density and extractable level. Important process parameters are the level and the differentiation in maximum polymerization temperatures along the reaction zones, the pressure level, and the type and distribution of CTA over the reactor.     Extrusion Coating    [0134]    Monolayer extrusion coatings were performed at a set temperature profile represented following temperature settings: Extruder Barrel - 200C / 250C / 280C / 290C / 290C / 290C; Flange/ Adapter/ Piping - 290C (6 zones); and Die - 290C x 10 Zones.     [0135]    The LDPE resins were extruded on a ""3.5 inch"" diameter screw, with a length over diameter (L/D) ratio of 32, onto 70 g/m<2>Kraft paper in an amount (coating weight) of 25 g/m<2>. Melt pressure and melt temperature were recorded with thermocouples placed in the adapter. The melt was delivered through a Davis Standard/Er-We-Pa flex lip edge bead reduction die, Series 510A, nominally set to a die gap of 0.7 mm. The melt drawing and application of the melt vertically onto the moving substrate was performed at an air gap of 250 mm and a nip off-set of 15mm, towards the pressure roll. The melt was applied onto the moving substrate in the laminator nip, which is the contact point of the pressure roll, with a rubber surface layer contacting the ""water cooled"" chill roll with a matte surface finish, and maintained at a temperature of 15C to 20C. The air gap is defined as the vertical distance between the die lip and the laminator nip. The nip off-set is defined as the horizontal off-set of the die lip position relative to the laminator nip.     [0136]    A line speed of 300 m/min was used to determine ""the neck-in."" For ""draw-down"" determination, varying (gradually increasing) line speed was used, at a coating weight of 15 g/m<2>. ""Draw down"" is defined as the maximum line speed attainable before web breakage occurs. ""Neck-in"" is the difference between the final width of the web and the die width at fixed line speed (300 m/min). Lower ""neck-in"" and higher ""draw down"" are both very desirable. Lower ""neck-in"" indicates better dimensional stability of the web, which, in turn, provides better control of the coating onto the substrate. Higher ""draw down"" indicates higher line speed, which, in turn, means better productivity. Results are shown in Table 6.Table 6: Neck-In and Draw-Down PG7004CE, AC88115PT7007CE, AC92190PT7009CE, AC109240SABIC NEXCOATCE, tub EC113322ACE, tub251350BCE, tub227485CCE, tub187600DCE, tub260250ECE, tub183550FCE, tub160300GCE, tub1702501IE, tub1212002IE, tub1342843IE, tub1173504IE, tub1091505IE, tub122300    [0137]    Table 6 shows ""neck-in"" and ""draw down."" It is most critical to consider ""neck-in."" The autoclave-based PG7004, PT7007, and PT7009 have low ""neck-in,"" and are commercially applied in extrusion coating applications. Typically it is difficult to achieve low ""neck-in"" with tubular LDPE. When considering comparative examples A-G, Table 6 shows much higher ""neck-in"" than the AC-based (Autoclave-based) CE. In contrast, IE 1-5 show a significant improvement (lower) ""neck-in,"" and a final result close to the AC-based benchmarks. The ""draw down"" of these inventive examples is also matching, or even slightly higher than, the drawdown of the AC-based CEs. The inventive examples provide good extrusion coatings even at lower Mw(abs), as compared to the AC-based examples. Also, the inventive examples were observed to have a significantly better web appearance (transparency and gloss) than the autoclave-based references. The inventive examples can be made on a tubular reactor train, with improved conversion levels, and lower energy input, as compared to autoclave processes. Furthermore, the inventive polymers make it possible to produce high clarity film and extrusion coatings on one tubular reactor train. For high clarity film applications, gel levels should be extremely low. To achieve low gel levels, a crosslinking agent and/or a comonomer with crosslinking capability are typically not desired in the formation of the polymer. It has been discovered that the inventive ethylene-based polymers have improved elasticity and coating performance, without an excessive presence of high molecular weight fraction. The combination of I2, Mw(abs) and G' provide for high elasticity at moderateMw(abs).     [0138]    The present invention can also be described as set out in the following numbered clauses:1.

The device of the present disclosure not only provides a new method for accurately determining whether there are circulating tumor cells in the blood of the living animal and provides a new method for sorting and counting the circulating tumor cells in the blood of the living animal, but also provides a pioneering new method and new device for therapy of the tumor transfer and removal of the tumor cells inside the body, and has extremely high economic and social values.","TECHNICAL FIELD     [0001]    The present disclosure relates to a technical field of separating cells in fluid, and specifically relates to a device for filtering and separating target cells in cell suspension by membranes.      BACKGROUND ART     [0002]    In prior arts, when it is necessary to separate and detect circulating tumor cells (CTC) in the blood of a living animal (including a human body), cell sorting and counting are performed by drawing a certain volume of blood and then using a method such as the density gradient centrifugation. The density gradient centrifugation method uses a certain medium to form a continuous or discontinuous density gradient in a centrifugal tube, places the cell suspension or homogenate on top of the medium, and sorts the cells through gravity or centrifugal force field effects. Its disadvantages are as below: 1. due to the limitation of the centrifuge, it is impossible to simultaneously perform centrifugation on a large volume of the cell suspension and thereby separate the cells, and the efficiency is low; 2. the added medium may affect the cell activity and the property of the solution, and operations of removing the medium are time-consuming and labored; 3. the operation is complicated and has a high requirement on the medium configuration. Hence, a new device and method for separating and detecting the number of the circulating tumor cells in the blood of a living animal is needed in this field. In recent years, a method of separating the circulating tumor cells in the blood by using a track-etched membrane appears in this field. For example,""Preparation of polycarbonate nuclear track microfilters and their applications"" by Huanhua CUI, Shicheng WANG , et al. discloses using a track microporous filter membrane to diagnose the circulating tumor cells in the blood, specifically, putting the circulating tumor cells retained on the track microporous filter membrane to be observed under a microscope. The inventor of the present disclosure also uses this membrane to separate the circulating tumor cells in the blood of some living animals (for example, rabbits), and diagnoses and counts the circulating tumor cells. However, a device corresponding to this method may only be able to separate the circulating tumor cells in very small portion of blood of the living animal at a time, and cannot effectively separate the circulating tumor cells in most or all of the blood of the living animal. In particular, for a larger living animal(for example, a human body), such defect is particularly significant. The reason is that, in order to maintain the living animal in a normal living state, it is impossible to evacuate all the blood from the living animal to separate the circulating tumor cells; otherwise the individual will die. In addition, because the number of the circulating tumor cells (CTC) in the blood is extremely small, the sensitivity of the separation and detection may be greatly reduced (the detection result may be incorrect easily) if only a small volume of the blood of the living animal is drawn to perform the separation and detection; but increase of the volume of the blood for processing may threaten the healthy and life of the living animal. Therefore, it is further necessary to provide a new device and method for separating and detecting the circulating tumor cells in a living animal (including a human body) in this field.      SUMMARY     [0003]    The present disclosure solves the above technical problem with a brand-new idea. The inventor of the present disclosure achieves the above technical purpose by using a device combining ""a separation column having a track-etched membrane"" and ""a main circulation conduit"". A sample injection port 20 and a sample discharge port 21 of the device of the present disclosure are coupled to the two ends of a cell liquid container (arteries and veins of the living animal). The circular filtration and separation of the circulating tumor cells are achieved by the blood flowing circularly within the main circulation conduit of the device. Thus, accurate detection with high sensitivity of whether the blood of the living animal already contains the circulating tumor cells and accurate counting of all the circulating tumor cells in the blood of the living animal may be then conveniently achieved by collecting the circulating tumor cells. The use of the device of the present disclosure further brings two additional technical effects. One is that all the blood flowing through the device may circulate back into the body of the living animal, and no blood of the living animal will be wasted. The other one is that after the living animal whose blood contains circulating tumor cells uses the circulation device of the present disclosure, almost all the circulating tumor cells in the blood may be filtered out, so that the transfer of the circulating tumor cells from a primary lesion to other organs inside the body may be cut off. Thus, the device of the present disclosure has very significant economic interest and social interest.     [0004]    The present disclosure provides a device for separating cells in fluid, which comprises a first driving pump communicating with an sample injection port, a separation column, a detection column, a second driving pump for driving cells separated from the separation column to enter the detection column, and several three-way valves as well as secondary driving pumps, wherein, one end of the separation column is connected with the first driving pump through a first three-way valve; the other end is connected with the second driving pump through a second three-way valve; the detection column is connected with a third channel port of the first three-way valve, and a third channel port of the second three-way valve is connected with a sample discharge port; wherein, a cell liquid container is detachably communicated between the sample injection port and the sample discharge port, so that the cell liquid container together with the device of the present disclosure forms a circulation passage ; wherein, the device further comprises a main circulation conduit sequentially communicating with the sample injection port, the first driving pump, the first three-way valve, the separation column, the sample discharge port, the cell liquid container, and the sample injection port; wherein, a third three-way valve for adding anticoagulant physiological saline into the main circulation conduit is connected on the main circulation conduit, and is positioned between the sample injection port and the separation column; a fourth three-way valve for adding anticoagulant antagonist into the main circulation conduit is connected on the main circulation conduit, and is positioned between the sample discharge port and the separation column; the separation column includes at least five sub filtration columns in parallel; the sub filtration column comprises a fixing bracket and a track-etched membrane of polycarbonate or polyester material attached to the bottom of and the side surfaces all around the fixing brackets, the pore diameter of the track-etched membrane being 5-25 m; wherein, the detection column comprises two portions which are movably connected, the outer sides of the free ends of said two portions are both provided with liquid channel ports adapted to the conduit, a sealed hollow cavity is formed between said two portions, and the hollow cavity is provided with one or more layers of the track-etched membranes of polycarbonate or polyester material, the pore diameter of the track-etched membrane being 5-25 m.     [0005]    The pore diameter of the track-etched membrane 7 provided by the present disclosure matches with the size of the circulating tumor cells to be separated, so that normal red blood cells, white blood cells and blood platelets as well as other small molecules in the blood may all pass through, while the circulating tumor cells are retained at the upstream side of the track-etched membrane 7.     [0006]    The device of the present disclosure provides not only a new method for accurately determining whether there are circulating tumor cells in the blood of the living animal but also a new method for sorting and counting the circulating tumor cells in the blood of the living animal, and it further provides a pioneering new method and device for therapy of the tumor transfer and removal of the tumor cells inside the body, and has extremely high economic and social values.     [0007]    In the present disclosure, the ""anticoagulant physiological saline"" means the physiological saline containing anticoagulants, wherein the anticoagulants are for example EDTA salt or citric acid salt, and the ""anticoagulant physiological saline"" is added into the main circulation conduit so that the fluid (blood containing circulating tumor cells) will not result in blood coagulation during the process of contacting the track-etched membrane 7 after entering the separation column 3. The ""anticoagulant antagonist"" means the physiological saline containing antagonist of anticoagulant, wherein the ""antagonist of anticoagulant"" is calcium salt, for example, calcium chloride. Before the blood in which the circulating tumor cells are filtered out is returned back into the body of the living animal (including a human body), it is necessary to add the ""anticoagulant antagonist"" into the main circulation conduit downstream of the separation column 3, so that the blood into which the anticoagulant is added will not poison the living animal due to the direct introduction of the blood into the living animal.     [0008]    In the present disclosure, the track-etched membrane 7 may be provided on the outer side, inner side of the fixing brackets, or embedded in the brackets, and there is no limitation on this in the present disclosure. In the present disclosure, both of the separation column 3 and detection column 4 may be arranged freely either horizontally or vertically or in other manners, and the implementation of the present disclosure will not be affected. In the present disclosure, the detection column 4 functions to enrich the target cells so as to facilitate the observation and detection. The membrane in the detection column may be taken out and placed under the detection device to be detected (for example, to be observed and determined under the microscope or to count the target cells after dyeing). Thus, a more accurate definition of the detection column 4 should be a cell enrichment column. In the present disclosure, the track-etched membrane 7 in the separation column 3 requited to be a single-layer membrane, and stacking of two layers of the membranes is not allowed. The technical solution in which the inner side and outer side of the fixing bracket are provided with one layer of the track-etched membrane 7 respectively is not a preferable technical solution, because it will affect the flowing of the fluid in the main circulation conduit. The track-etched membrane 7 in the detection column 4 is also preferably a single-layer membrane; otherwise, the flowing velocity of the fluid may be greatly affected. However, the detection column 4 may be provided with two or more layers of the track-etched membranes 7 in total while a certain pitch is kept between the membranes. More preferably, there is only one layer of the track-etched membrane 7 in the detection column 4, while two or more detection columns 4 connected in series are preferably used for enriching the target cells, resulting in a theoretically more accurate number of the target cells.     [0009]    In a specific embodiment, a first secondary pump is connected to a third channel port of the third three-way valve, and a second secondary pump is connected to a third channel port of the forth three-way valve.     [0010]    In a specific embodiment, the third three-way valve is positioned between the sample injection port and the first driving pump, or the third three-way valve is positioned between the first driving pump and the separation column; the forth three-way valve is positioned between the sample discharge port and the second three-way valve, or the forth three-way valve is positioned between the second three-way valve and the separation column.     [0011]    Preferably, the pore diameter of the track-etched membrane in the detection column is smaller than or equal to the pore diameter of the track-etched membrane in the separation column.     [0012]    In a specific embodiment, the separation column comprises a liquid dispersion region positioned at one end close to the sample injection port and sub filtration columns positioned in a mid-section thereof. Preferably, one end surface of the liquid dispersion region is a port cover plate with a liquid channel port opened thereon, and the other end surface of the liquid dispersion region is a support plate with through holes corresponding to a total number of end surfaces of the sub filtration columns opened therein. Please see Fig. 3 for the configuration of the shown preferable technical solution. Furthermore, although the sub filtration columns 19 shown in Fig. 5 of the present disclosure are all in an elongated cylindrical shape, the sub filtration columns 19 are not limited to the elongated cylindrical shape, and may be in other shapes, such as an elongated strip shape with a triangle, rectangular cross-section, or a long sheet shape with an elongated rectangular cross-section.     [0013]    In a specific embodiment, the driving pump is a peristaltic pump. Selecting the peristaltic pump as the driving pump may cause the flowing of the fluid to be more stable. Preferably, the first secondary pump or the second secondary pump is a peristaltic pump or a push-type infusion pump.     [0014]    Preferably, the device according to the present disclosure further comprises a pressure sensor which is provided on the main circulation conduit and is positioned between the first driving pump and the separation column; and the device further comprises a conduit line heater.     [0015]    Preferably, the pore diameters of the track-etched membranes in the separation column and the detection column are both 8-10 m.     [0016]    In a specific embodiment, the detection column is made of plasticized polyvinyl chloride.     [0017]    The present disclosure obtains the device by combining the ""separation column having three-dimensional track-etched membrane"" with the ""circulating membrane separation structure"", which has the following beneficial effects:1. Separation of cells in the blood of the living animal:as seen from Fig. 8 , the present disclosure performs filtration in a circulation manner, i.e., after the filtration of the liquid entered from an inlet of the system is completed, the liquid returns back into the original solution from an outlet of the system, and thus a circulation loop is formed. During a uninterrupted circulation process, particular cells with large volumes in the cell suspension are retained, while cells with small volumes pass through the filter membrane and return back into the solution. The advantage is that the total volume of the cell suspension outside the system (device) remains unchanged, wherein the number of the cells with small volumes remains unchanged.Thus, the sample injection port of the device is connected with the artery of an animal, the sample discharge port of the device is connected with the vein of the animal. With the help of a power pump, the blood sample may be led out from the artery, and after the target cells of interest are separated through the membranes having a proper pore diameter on the separation column, other components are transfused back through the vein. In this way, it is possible to process as many blood samples as possible and separate more cells of interest while the survival of the animal is guaranteed (which further needs the help of adding the anticoagulant into the upstream end of the separation column in the main circulation conduit and adding the antagonist of the anticoagulant into the downstream end of the separation column). Compared with the traditional methods, the separation efficiency and separation sensitivity are significantly improved while the survival of the animal is guaranteed. In this way, multiple cell separations at multiple time points may be performed on the same animal. None of the current cell sorting methods may achieve the above effect.2. Improvement of the separation efficiency: take a C-ISET separation column having a diameter of 6 centimeters and a length of 11 centimeters as an example, wherein 11 cylindrical sub filtration columns in parallel each of which has a diameter of 1 centimeter and a length of 10 centimeters may be placed in the C-ISET separation column. The separation column with this specification has an effective filtration area of 354 square centimeters, while the conventional filtration device (a disc-shaped separation column having one layer of the track-etched membrane, wherein the track-etched membrane is round-shaped, and the shape of which is similar to the structure of the detection column 4 in the present disclosure) with a diameter of 6 centimeters has an effective filtration area of merely 28.26 square centimeters. The separation column of the present disclosure has an effective filtration area that is 1252% of that of the traditional filtration device, which is 11.52 times larger than that of the traditional filtration device. This means that the capability of processing samples in the unit time is greatly improved, and the time for processing samples with the same volume is greatly reduced.3. Reduction of the pressure on the surface of the filter membrane by three-dimensional filtration: cells are very delicate, and have strong deformability. Thus, in the cell sorting, especially the sorting of the living cells, it is very important to adopt a low pressure filtration to keep the activity of the cells. With the three-dimensional filtration method in which the track-etched membrane wraps the lower end of and the side surfaces all around the bracket of the separation column, the pressure on the membrane of which reduces 9-12 times as compared with the conventional plane-typed filtration method, the integrity of the cell (for example, the red blood cell in the blood of an human body) may be effectively protected.4. Unnecessary to add the medium: the device physically filters the cells without the addition of chemical substances which may affect the cell activity and the solution property. In this way, after the filtration, forms and activities of the target cells and non-target cells will not be destroyed, and the property of the original solution will not be destroyed.5. Large amount of samples: the circulation loop of membrane filtration device for fluid of the present disclosure may filter a cell suspension of more than 5000 milliliters (substantially equivalent to the total amount of the blood in the human body) with one operation, and is especially suitable for the filtration of the cell suspension having large amount of samples.    [0018]    In addition to the purposes, features, and advantages mentioned above, the present disclosure also has other purposes, features and advantages.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION     [0021]    The embodiments of the present disclosure are illustrated in detail according in combination with the accompanying drawings. However, the present disclosure may be implemented according to a plurality of different methods defined and covered by the claims.     [0022]    The present disclosure provides a device for separating circulating tumor cells in blood, which comprises a first driving pump communicating with an sample injection port, a separation column, a detection column, a second driving pump for driving cells separated from the separation column to enter the detection column, and several three-way valves as well as secondary driving pumps, wherein, one end of the separation column is connected with the first driving pump through a first three-way valve; the other end is connected with the second driving pump through a second three-way valve; the detection column is connected with a third channel port of the first three-way valve, and a third channel port of the second three-way valve is connected with a sample discharge port; wherein, a cell liquid container (a living animal) is detachably communicated (communicating with the arteries and the veins of the living animal) between the sample injection port and the sample discharge port, so that the cell liquid container together with the device of the present disclosure forms a circulation passage ; wherein, the device further comprises a main circulation conduit sequentially communicating the sample injection port, the first driving pump, the first three-way valve, the separation column, the sample discharge port, the cell liquid container, and the sample injection port; wherein, a third three-way valve for adding anticoagulant physiological saline into the main circulation conduit is connected on the main circulation conduit, and is positioned between the sample injection port and the separation column; a fourth three-way valve for adding anticoagulant antagonist into the main circulation conduit is connected on the main circulation conduit, and is positioned between the sample discharge port and the separation column; the separation column includes at least five sub filtration columns in parallel; the sub filtration column comprises a fixing bracket and a track-etched membrane of polycarbonate or polyester material attached to the bottom of and the side surface all around the fixing bracket, the pore diameter of the track-etched membrane being 5-25 m; wherein, the detection column comprises two portions which are movably connected, the outer sides of the free ends of said two portions are provided with liquid channel ports adapted to the conduit, a sealed hollow cavity is formed between said two portions, and the hollow cavity is provided with one or more layers of the track-etched membranes of polycarbonate or polyester material, the pore diameter of the track-etched membrane being 5-25 m.     [0023]    In a case where the first three-way valve 5 rotates to different positions, the separation column 3 may be in communication with any one of the first driving pump and the detection column 4 respectively.     [0024]    The separation column 3 includes therein at least five sub filtration columns in parallel. The sub filtration column comprises a fixing bracket 13 and a track-etched membrane 7 attached to the bottom of and the side surfaces the fixing bracket, and sorting of cells in a three-dimensional wrapping way without dead angle has a better efficiency. When the cell suspension flows through the separation column 3, cells with a size larger than 5-25 m will be intercepted and held up inside the sub separation column by the track-etched membrane 7, and small cells may pass through freely. The pore diameter of the track-etched membrane 7 is preferably 8-10 m.     [0025]    The track-etched membrane 7 may be made of polycarbonate or polyester, neither of which affects the implementation of the present embodiment. The track-etched membrane adopts the isotope track-etched technique, which leads to a smooth membrane surface, evenly distributed pores, and highly consistent and smooth pore diameters, and thus the membrane is an idea material for separating the biological cells. The track-etched membrane sold in prior arts may be used as the track-etched membrane 7 described in the present disclosure.     [0026]    As seen from Fig. 3 , Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 , the separation column may further comprises port cover plates 15 of two ends, a support plate 14 within the port cover plates 15 and sub filtration columns, wherein the sub filtration columns are positioned between the support plate 14 of the sample injection port and the port cover plate 15 of the sample discharge port (the end close to the sample discharge port may be either provided with a support plate or without a support plate), and are constituted by several fixing brackets and the track-etched membrane. Each of the above means may be disassembled and used flexibly. It is also possible that different numbers of the sub filtration columns 19 may be provided according to different requirements. Several round holes may be provided on the support plate 14 and are configured to jam the fixing bracket 13 so as to stabilize its structure. The port cover plate 15 is provided with the liquid channel port 8 adapted to the conduit to facilitate the suspension flowing through. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show that, in each sub filtration column, the track-etched membrane 7 is connected thereabove with a sealing ring and a threaded coupling, the purpose of which is to form a good seal between the support plate 14 and the sub filtration column 19.     [0027]    When the cylindrical sub filtration column has a bottom surface diameter of 8 mm and a length of 10 cm, 10 sub filtration columns are in parallel with the exterior sealed and surrounded by a housing of polycarbonate material, and the total filtration area of the filtration column is 256 cm<2>. Such design may increase the filtration area on one hand, and may enable the filter membrane to bear larger pressure on the other hand.     [0028]    As seen from Fig. 6 , the detection column 4 may be made of plasticized polyvinyl chloride, and comprises an upper portion and a lower portion which are movably connected. Liquid channel ports 8 adapted to the conduit are both provided at the outer sides of said two portions. The hollow cavity between the sealed two portions is provided with a layer of the track-etched membrane 7 where the pore diameter of the track-etched membrane is 5-25 m, preferably 8-10 m. When the cell suspension flows through the detection column 4 via the liquid channel port 8, cells with a size larger than 5-25 m will be intercepted and held up by the track-etched membrane 7.     [0029]    As seen from Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 , the device of the present disclosure forms two operation passages by using the three-way valves, the separation column and the detection column. The first passage is as shown in Fig. 1 (in Fig. 1 , the direction of the arrows indicates the flowing direction of the fluid), and cell suspension with large amount of samples enters the separation column 3 from the cell liquid container 18 through the sample injection port 20, the first driving pump 1, and the first three-way valve 5, and discharges from the other end, then flows back to the cell liquid container 18 through the sample discharge port 21 after being filtered, which achieves the purpose of separating particular cells with large volumes effectively. Because the separation is performed through a uninterrupted circulation, namely, the cell liquid container-the pump-the separation column, it may be guaranteed that the total volume of the cell suspension outside the membrane filtration system for fluid remains unchanged during the separation process, wherein the number of the cells of small volumes remains unchanged. Fig. 1 further includes injecting anticoagulant physiological saline to the main circulation conduit from the conduit 11b and injecting anticoagulant antagonist to the main circulation conduit from the conduit 12b.     [0030]    For example, when the living animal (including human) is taken as the specific cell liquid container, the blood may be led out from the artery through a pump, and then transfused into the vein after being filtered by the separation column, leading to the separation of the particular cells with no influence on the health of the living animal.     [0031]    The second passage is as shown in Fig. 2 in which the three-way valve is adjusted, the connection channel of the sample injection port 20 and the separation column 3 is closed, the fluid (for example, the physiological saline) flows through the separation column 3 from the second driving pump 2 reversely (flows in a direction opposite to the flowing direction of the fluid in the main circulation conduit), and discharges from the other end, and then enters the detection column 4. This passage further enriches the particular cells with large volumes retained from the separation column 3 (firstly the cells with large volumes are made detached from the membrane in the separation column 3 under the effect of the second driving pump 2, then the physiological saline containing those cells with large volumes enters the detection column 4), concentrates the cells on the filter membrane (the track-etched membrane) of the detection column 4 which facilitates performing downstream operation and detection on the cells on the membrane. The wasted liquid discharges from the other end of the detection column 4.     [0032]    The device of the present disclosure completes substantially at least the following three steps. Step A is circulation and filtration where target cells in a first flow of fluid (for example, the blood) are retained by the track-etched membrane in the separation column under the circulation and filtration condition. Step B is detachment where a second flow of fluid (for example, the physiological saline) flows in a direction opposite to that of the first flow of fluid so that the target cells originally retained are detached from the membrane. Step C is reception or enrichment of the cells where the cell reception means to use a container to completely receive the target cells and the second flow of fluid and the cell enrichment means to filter the second flow of fluid by using the detection column 4 having the track-etched membrane and simultaneously enrich the target cells on the upstream side of the track-etched membrane. Apparently, in step C, the enrichment method provided in the present disclosure is more preferable. In this way, it is unnecessary to perform further cell enrichment on the received solution by using the conventional method such as a centrifuge. In addition, a washing step may be comprised before and after ""step A of circulation and filtration"" described above in the present disclosure. Specifically, the physiological saline is used to wash the conduits in the device. The washing step after the step of circulation and filtration may cause the blood from the body of the cell liquid container 18 to flow back into the body of the cell liquid container 18 completely without any blood remaining in the conduit line device.     [0033]    As seen from Fig. 7 , the device of the present disclosure is an integrated machine composed of components, such as a touch display screen 16, a primary peristaltic pump, a pressure sensor, a secondary peristaltic pump, a push-type infusion pump, filtration column fixing brackets, an air discharge device, a conduit line heater and a base bracket, and connecting conduits, and the device has the characteristics of compact structure, comprehensive function, and timely information sampling. In the device, the touch display screen 16 which is a terminal displaying operation situation of each component is connected with a main board of the machine and displays key information such as pressure, flow rate, rotation speed, temperature and time with a hand touch function enabling control of operations of other components on the screen. The primary peristaltic pump, which is a main device for providing power, provides power by causing the steel column in the rotary disk to contact the conduit wall and extruding the conduit wall. The pressure sensor is configured to detect the pressure variation in the conduit line and detect whether the whole system is running smoothly. The push-type infusion pump may continuously provide the conduits with medicines (anticoagulant physiological saline or anticoagulant antagonist) necessary for guaranteeing the smooth flow of the fluid without generation of solid impurity. The filtration column fixing bracket is used to fix the membrane filtration column. The air discharge device may discharge the air in the conduit line and prevent the air from entering the connecting conduits. The conduit line heater 17 may heat the fluid in the conduit line so as to maintain the fluid at the most appropriate survival temperature for cells of 37C. The conduit line heater 17 may be connected with any part of the conduits, for example, the sample injection port, the first three-way valve, the second three-way valve, the cell liquid container, and the sample discharge port.     [0034]    As seen from Fig. 9 , the separation results of the vitro experiments performed by the device of the present disclosure and conventional separation device are compared.     [0035]    Firstly, preparing which is formed by four types of lung cancer cells, namely, A549, LLC, H520, H1299, the quantity of each of which is 1000, forms 5 L of cell suspension together with the physiological saline.     [0036]    The separation column in the device of the present disclosure has a diameter of 6 cm and a length of 11 cm, and contains 11 cylindrical sub filtration columns in parallel, each of which has a diameter of 1 cm and a length of 10 cm. The total effective filtration area of the separation columns is 354 square centimeters. The cell suspension flows in a circulation manner on the separation column. The total volume of the cell suspension processed by the separation column is 5 L, and the fluid flowing velocity is 250 milliliter per minute.     [0037]    As for the conventional separation device, the separation column thereof has a shape and a structure similar to those of the detection column 4 in the present disclosure, and the track-etched membrane thereof with pore diameter of 6 centimeter has an effective filtration area of 28.26 square centimeters. The cell suspension is filtered on the separation column once, rather than flow in a circulation manner, and the total volume of the cell suspension processed by the separation column is 5 ml. Thus, theoretically, the cell suspension contains approximately only one cell.     [0038]    In Fig. 9 , the solid dots indicate results obtained by the device of the present disclosure, and the hollow dots indicate results obtained by the conventional separation device. As can be seen from the drawing, the number of complete undamaged lung cancer cells of four types, namely, A549, LLC, H520, H1299 sorted by the device of the present disclosure are 988.33148.17, 862.67103.65, 104879.3, 85591.39, respectively. The 1000 cells configured to be used in the cell suspension and the result data in Fig. 9 are all obtained by the cell counter, and thus there might be some errors. A plurality of separation results of the conventional separation device may fluctuate around the theoretical value (1 tumor cell), and thus the resultant data cannot be used to accurately determine whether there are circulating tumor cells in the blood of the living animal (including human body) or how many circulating tumor cells there are in the blood.     [0039]    The tumor cell has a size larger than that of the normal blood cell. In the device of the present disclosure, during the process when the blood flows through the separation column once, a portion of tumor cells may possibly pass through the membrane, and an extremely small portion of blood cells may be retained on the membrane. However, because the separation steps of the device in the present disclosure are performed in a circulation manner, after the blood flows through the separation column several times, the normal blood cells and tumor cells can be separated by the membrane thoroughly.     [0040]    One skilled in the art may easily understand that the technical solution of the claims (especially claim 1) of the present disclosure may be replaced by the equivalents in the following aspects.     [0041]    First, the three-way valves may be equivalently replaced by a three-way conduit plus cut-off valves (e.g., shutoff valves, ball valves, butterfly valves, gate valves, etc.) respectively provided on the conduit.     [0042]    Second, a plurality of peristaltic pumps may be equivalently replaced by a peristaltic pump plus a plurality of parallel conduits provided thereon (the picture of the peristaltic pump provided in Fig. 10 shows a case where a peristaltic pump is equipped with a plurality of pump heads in parallel). For example, both the conduit 11b (the conduit connecting the first secondary pump 11 to the main circulation conduit) and the conduit 12b (the conduit connecting the second secondary pump 12 to the main circulation conduit) may be independently connected on the first driving pump, and be parallel with the main circulation conduit 1a connected on the first driving pump 1. Thus, by using only one peristaltic pump (namely, the first driving pump 1), the functions of the three peristaltic pumps 1, 11, and 12 in the present disclosure may be replaced and achieved. A plurality of parallel connections may also be applied, for example, the first secondary pump 11 being connected in parallel with the second secondary pump 12, the first driving pump 1 being connected in parallel with the first secondary pump 11 and the like. For example, when the device of the present disclosure is provided with three pump heads of the peristaltic pump in total(another pump is the push pump), either two of the three pump heads may be in parallel while the rest is independent, or the three pump heads are in parallel.     [0043]    Third, Fig. 1 and claim 1 of the present disclosure defines that the fluid flows according to the following order: from the sample injection port 20, to the first driving pump 1, the first three-way valve and the separation column 3. However, by reading the present disclosure, one skilled in the art may know that it is sufficient as long as the detection column 4 is connected to the upstream end of the separation column 3 in the fluid flowing direction in the main circulation conduit (rather than connected to the downstream end of the separation column 3). Thus, position exchange between the first driving pump 1 and the first three-way valve 5 is an alternative equivalent of the present disclosure. That is, in the main circulation conduit, the fluid flows in the following order: from the sample injection port 20 to the first three-way valve 5, the first driving pump 1 and the separation column 3.     [0044]    Fourth, the second driving pump 2 and the detection column 4 of the present disclosure respectively serve the function of detachment (which causes the cells retained on the membrane in the separation column 3 to be detached from the membrane) and enrichment (which causes the target cells to be enriched on the membrane of the detection column) effects, respectively. In fact, the detection column 4 may be replaced by an equivalent of a receiving container plus centrifugal separation steps. That is to say, in the present disclosure, it is possible to connect a receiving container (e.g. a volumetric flask, a beaker)instead at the position of the detection column 4, and transfer the fluid in the receiving container at one or more times into the centrifugal conduit to be centrifuged and enriched so as to obtain target cells, and then deliver the enriched target cells to be counted under the detection apparatus.     [0045]    Moreover, although claim 1 of the present disclosure defines that the number of the sub filtration columns 19 in the separation column is five or more in parallel, one skilled in the art may arrange 4, 3, 2, or even 1 sub filtration column(s). Even if provided with only one sub filtration column, the separation column has better filtration effect as compared with the case where the device of the present disclosure is connected to a separation column (the structure of which is similar to the detection column 4 in the present disclosure) having only one layer of round planar membrane. Such technical solution in which the number of the sub filtration columns is less than five also belongs to the alternative equivalents of the present disclosure (for example, through a conventional design of the shape and size of the membrane conduit, the difference of 4 sub filtration columns from 5 sub filtration columns can be compensated).     [0046]    In addition, although claim 1 of the present disclosure defines the track-etched membrane of polycarbonate or polyester material at the bottom and the side surface of the fixing bracket of the sub filtration column, when the surface area of the bottom of the fixing bracket of the sub filtration column is far less than (for example, the sum of the surface areas of the side surfaces is 5 times or more as large as the surface area of the bottom) the surface areas of the side surfaces all around, it is possible to provide no track-etched membrane on the bottom surface (basically the surface area of the bottom may be ignored with respect to the total surface area), and instead adopt other materials (for example, plasticized polyvinyl chloride) to perform sealing. Alternatively, the total area of one surface of the fixing bracket is extremely small, and thus the prior art cannot provide the track-etched membrane on the surface. At this time, it is possible to provide no membrane on the bottom surface or one or more side surfaces all around, and instead adopt other materials to perform sealing. Such a method also belongs to the alternative equivalents of the technical solution of claim 1 of the present disclosure. The above are merely preferable embodiments of the present disclosure and are not intended to limit the present disclosure. For one skilled in the art, various modifications and changes may be applied to the present disclosure. All modifications, equivalents, improvements made within the spirit and principle of the present disclosure should be included in the protection scope of the present disclosure.

TECHNICAL FIELD    [0002]    Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of information query technologies, and specifically to a method, system and storage medium for implementing intelligent question answering.     BACKGROUND    [0003]    An intelligent question answering (QA) system is an intelligent system based on reasoning from massive Internet data and thorough semantic language understanding. Intelligent QA systems not only can answer knowledge questions, but also can be applied to various fields closely related to daily life, such as medical care, education, life, and science and technology, significantly increasing the information acquisition efficiency.     [0004]    Existing intelligent QA systems are based mainly on questions and answers in communities, and return a user's answer with high similarity after mining historical data about users' questions and answers, and calculating similarity between a user's question and existing questions in a QA site.     [0005]    The disadvantages of the above intelligent QA systems lie in that the intelligent QA systems relying on a QA site have low coverage of questions and cannot meet the users' requirement to answer moderately to less frequently and rarely asked questions. Answers provided by such systems are non-deterministic and not accurate enough.     SUMMARY    [0006]    Embodiments of the present invention provide a method, system and storage medium for implementing intelligent question answering, so as to improve the accuracy of answers to the questions.     [0007]    According to a first aspect, an embodiment of the present invention provides a method for implementing intelligent question answering, which comprises:receiving a query question;performing a semantic analysis of the question;performing corresponding search processing for the question based on a result of the semantic analysis, the search processing comprising search processing performed for the question by at least one of a semantic relationship mining system, a text library search system, a knowledge base search system, and a question and answer library search system; and returning an answer based on a result of the search processing.    [0008]    According to a second aspect, an embodiment of the present invention provides a system for implementing intelligent question answering, which comprises:a central control system for receiving a query question;a question analysis system for performing a semantic analysis of the question,the central control system being further configured to distribute, based on a result of the semantic analysis, the question to a corresponding back-end system for corresponding search processing,the back-end system comprising at least one of a semantic relationship mining system, a text library search system, a knowledge base search system, and a question and answer library search system,the central control system being further configured to return an answer based on a result of the search processing.    [0009]    According to a third aspect, an embodiment of the present invention provides a non-volatile computer storage medium storing one or more modules which when executed by a device performing a method for implementing intelligent question answering, cause the device to perform operations comprising:receiving a query question;performing a semantic analysis of the question;performing corresponding search processing for the question based on a result of the semantic analysis, wherein the search processing includes search processing performed for the question by at least one of a semantic relationship mining system, a text library search system, a knowledge base search system, and a question and answer library search system; and returning an answer based on a result of the search processing.    [0010]    According to the method, system and storage medium for implementing intelligent QA that are provided in the embodiments of the present invention, a semantic analysis of a query question is performed, and based on the semantic analysis, corresponding search processing is performed for the question by using at least one of the semantic relationship mining system, the text library search system, the knowledge base search system, and the question and answer library search system, which broadens the search scope of answers to questions. Therefore, on one hand, answers to the question become more accurate; on the other hand, the coverage of questions is expanded. Even for moderately to less frequently asked questions and rarely asked questions, accurate answers can be obtained through search, so that the accuracy of answers to the questions is effectively improved.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION    [0012]    The technical solutions of the embodiments of the present invention will be described clearly and completely below with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be apparent that the described embodiments are some embodiments rather than all embodiments of the present invention, used for explaining the principle of the present invention, and not intended to limit the present invention to these specific embodiments. On the basis of the embodiments in the present invention, all other embodiments acquired by those of ordinary skill in the art without creative work fall within the scope of the present invention.     [0013]    The methods of the embodiments of the present invention may be executed by a system for implementing intelligent QA that is configured to be implemented using hardware and/or software.     [0014]    For the purpose of clarity, the network architecture of the system is introduced below with reference to FIG. 1a . The system includes: a central control system, a question analysis system, and a back-end system.     [0015]    The central control system is used for receiving a query question (i.e., query in FIG. 1a ). The central control system may receive, through a pre-defined text box, a query question that is input by a user, or may receive, through a pre-defined action button, a query question that is input by the user. For example, the central control system receives, through an action button for receiving a user voice, a voice that is input by the user, and performs voice recognition to obtain content corresponding to the input voice, which is used as the query question. The question analysis system is used for performing a semantic analysis of the question. The central control system is further used for distributing, based on a result of the semantic analysis, the question to a corresponding back-end system for corresponding search processing. The back-end system includes at least one of the following systems: a semantic relationship (Frame) mining system, a text library search system, a knowledge base search system, and a question and answer library search system. The central control system is further used for returning an answer based on the result of the search processing (i.e., the result after merging in FIG. 1a ).     [0016]    It should be noted that the central control system is the core control system of the system for implementing intelligent QA, and is responsible for receiving the query question; forwarding the question to the question analysis system; distributing, based on the result of the semantic analysis of the question analysis system and on the basis of a pre-set distribution policy, the question to a relevant back-end system for corresponding search processing, specifically to at least one of the semantic relationship mining system, the text library search system, the knowledge base search system, and the question and answer library search system for corresponding search processing; and returning an answer based on the result of the search processing, so as to enable a front-end user of the central control system to know the answer corresponding to the query question, thereby implementing intelligent QA.     [0017]    Different back-end systems correspond to different resource libraries, which will be described in details in the following embodiments. In addition, the distribution policy will also be described hereinafter.     First embodiment    [0018]    Referring to FIG. 1b , a method for implementing intelligent QA provided by this embodiment includes: operations 110 to 140.     [0019]    In the operation 110, a query question is received.     [0020]    In this operation, the central control system receives a query question. The central control system may receive, through a text box that is pre-defined in a user interface, a query question that is input by a user, or may receive, through an action button that is pre-defined in a user interface, a query question that is input by the user. For example, the central control system receives, through an action button for receiving a user voice, a voice that is input by the user, and performs voice recognition to obtain content corresponding to the input voice, which is used as the query question.     [0021]    It should be noted that the received query question may have comprehensive coverage. In other words, the received query question may be any question, i.e. the received query question may be a question of which the frequency of occurrence is relatively high and that is of interest to the user, or may be a question of which the frequency of occurrence is moderate or to which the answers provided by the current QA system are not satisfactory to the user, and may also cover rarely asked questions, i.e., questions of which the frequency of occurrence is very low.     [0022]    In the operation 120, a semantic analysis of the question is performed.     [0023]    This operation is performed by the question analysis system, and a basic lexical analysis of the question may be performed. The basic lexical analysis may include performing segmentation processing and part-of-speech-tagging processing on the question, and may further include determining the importance of a search term in the question, performing a dependency syntax analysis of the question, etc.     [0024]    Dependency syntax was first proposed by a French linguist L. Tesniere in his workElements of Structural Syntaxin 1959, which has a profound effect on the development of linguistics. Dependency syntax analysis is an important branch of the syntax analysis in the natural language processing field. The dependency syntax analysis is to analyze a sentence to create a dependency syntax tree and describe the dependency relationship between phrases so as to reveal the syntactic structure of the sentence, and advocates that: the core verb in the sentence is the central element governing other elements, the core verb itself is not governed by any other element, and all the governed elements are subordinate to the governor on a certain dependency relationship.     [0025]    In this operation, in addition to performing the basic lexical analysis of the question, the method may further preferably include identifying a focus, an opinion, and a type of the opinion of the question.     [0026]    The focus of the question is a reference to the answer to the question, and may replace the answer to form a complete declarative sentence. For example, in the question ""Who is the 2013 Wimbledon Women's Singles champion,"" the focus is ""who"". The focus of the question is mainly identified by using a rule, where the identification rule may be that if the question is a question with an interrogative, the focus of the question is the interrogative; or if the question is a question without an interrogative, the focus of the question is empty by default.     [0027]    Identifying the opinion of the question refers to identifying the number of opinions of the question, i.e., the number of opinions contained in the question. The number of opinions of the question may be a general requirement. The number of opinions of a general requirement is generally greater than eight, or may be a specific number. For example, the number of opinions of the question ""What are wild animals"" is tens of thousands, respectively corresponding to different wild animals, and the opinion of the question is defined as a general requirement. For another example, the number of opinions of the question ""Four Beauties in Ancient China"" are four, because ""Four"" is mentioned in the question. As yet another example, the number of opinions of the question ""Who is the 2013 Wimbledon Women's Singles champion"" is one, because the champion is a single person in the context of the current question.     [0028]    Identifying the type of the opinion of the question refers to identifying the type of the opinion that is needed by the user. For example, for the question ""Who is the 2013 Wimbledon Women's Singles champion,"" the type of the opinion of the question is ""champion."" Methods for identifying the type of the opinion of the question are classified into two categories: rule-based identification methods and model learning models. In the rule-based identification methods, the type of the opinion is the word previous to the focus; in the model learning models, tools such as dependency syntax analysis are used as a basis to generate a training corpus and training model dynamics, so as to identify the type of the opinion of the question.     [0029]    The method may further include, after the opinion type of the question is identified: performing normalization processing on the type of the opinion of the question.     [0030]    Normalization of the type of the opinion of the question is to map the type of the opinion of the question to a fixed category system. For example, the question ""Who is the 2013 Wimbledon Women's Singles champion,"" of which the focus is ""who"" and the type of the opinion is ""champion,"" is normalized to the category ""person."" Methods for normalizing the type of the opinion of the question are generally based on an opinion rule or an opinion vocabulary.     [0031]    In the operation 130, corresponding search processing is performed for the question based on the result of the semantic analysis, wherein the search processing includes search processing performed for the question by at least one of the semantic relationship mining system, the text library search system, the knowledge base search system, and the question and answer library search system.     [0032]    As described above, this operation is executed by the central control system and a back-end system. Specifically, based on the result of the semantic analysis of the question analysis system and on the basis of a pre-set distribution policy, the question is distributed to a corresponding back-end system for corresponding search processing, specifically to at least one of the semantic relationship mining system, the text library search system, the knowledge base search system, and the question and answer library search system for corresponding search processing.     [0033]    The various back-end systems described above may be used separately, or may be used in combination.     [0034]    The distribution policy based on which the corresponding search processing is performed for the question based on the result of the semantic analysis may include:performing search processing for the question by the semantic relationship mining system if the analyzed question has a structural dependency type (i.e., ""previous sentence/next sentence"" type); otherwise, performing search processing for the question by the text library search system, the knowledge base search system, and the question and answer library search system.    [0035]    It should be noted that the search processing performed by the various back-end systems for the question is independent of each other.     [0036]    Resource libraries corresponding to different back-end systems will be described below.     [0037]    A resource library of the semantic relationship mining system may include two parts: an inverted index library, and a Kv (key value) resource library, both of which may be constructed by using an offline document processing program. Generally, there are many documents in a document set that contain a certain word, and each document records information such as a document number, the number of occurrences of the word in the document, and positions at which the word appears in the document. Such information related to one document is referred to as inverted indexes. The search efficiency can be improved by using inverted indexes. The Kv resource library may contain mined poem resources, lyric resources, etc., and is used for processing dependency-type questions.     [0038]    A resource library of the text library search system may include: a text library and a Kv resource library. The text library is established on the basis of the search engine technology to index, analyze and rank massive non-structured web pages, and based on the massive non-structured web page data. The Kv resource library is established based on libraries such as Baidu Baike and Wikipedia. Because massive non-structured web page data and the libraries such as Baidu Baike and Wikipedia contain extensive knowledge, the text library search system is the core of the entire back-end system, that is, a core processing system for implementing intelligent QA, which can implement the search of answers to the query question that is input by the user.     [0039]    A resource library of the knowledge base search system may be a structured offline mining knowledge base, which is stored in the form of a triplet <entity, attribute, value>, for example, <Zhang San, wife, beautiful girl>, <beautiful girl, constellation, Aries>, or <Avatar, author, James Cameron>, and is responsible for reasoning on the basis of information in the knowledge base. For example, for the question ""What is the constellation of Zhang San's wife?"" it can be reasoned from Zhang San's wife being a beautiful girl and the constellation of a beautiful girl being Aries that the answer to the question is ""Aries.""     [0040]    A resource library of the question and answer library search system may be a QA community resource library formed on the basis of offline mined high-quality QA data, for example, historical questions and answers of users in Baidu Zhidao. The processing procedure of the question and answer library search system is similar to that of the text library search system, and the specific processing procedure of the text library search system will be described in details in the following third embodiment.     [0041]    In the operation 140, an answer is returned based on the result of the search processing.     [0042]    According to the technical solution of this embodiment, a semantic analysis of a query question is performed, and based on the semantic analysis, corresponding search processing is performed for the question by using at least one of the semantic relationship mining system, the text library search system, the knowledge base search system, and the question and answer library search system, which broadens the search scope of answers to questions. Therefore, on one hand, answers to the question become more accurate; on the other hand, the coverage of questions is expanded. Even for moderately to less frequently asked questions and rarely asked questions, accurate answers can be obtained through search, so that the accuracy of answers to the questions is effectively improved.     [0043]    The method for implementing intelligent QA that is provided by this embodiment of the present invention may be executed by a cloud system, embedded in a robot of any external shape, and is applicable to any QA scenario. For example, the method is applicable to tutoring: students encountering unfamiliar knowledge points can directly communicate with a system for implementing intelligent QA to acquire more comprehensive, real and useful information, for example, ""Who proposed the Law of Gravity? What is the meaning of the proposal of the Law of Gravity."" For another example, the method is applicable to providing an automatic customer service in public places: when a customer is in a shopping mall or is choosing clothes, she interacts with a system for implementing intelligent QA to learn which one of natural fiber and synthetic fiber is better and learn their respective advantages and disadvantages; or when visiting a park, a tourist interacts with a system for implementing intelligent QA to learn information such as the flowering season of roses. For yet another example, the method is applicable to supplementary medical treatment: combining big data on the Internet and case information of users, and through analysis and reasoning by using a system for implementing intelligent QA, an etiological analysis is provided for reference.     [0044]    Exemplarily, performing corresponding search processing for the question based on the result of the semantic analysis includes:performing search processing for the question by the semantic relationship mining system if the analyzed question has a structural dependency type; otherwise, performing search processing for the question by the text library search system, the knowledge base search system, and the question and answer library search system.    [0045]    Exemplarily, performing search processing for the question by the semantic relationship mining system includes:searching the ternary relationship library for an answer to the question.    [0046]    Exemplarily, the ternary relationship library is established by:performing a grammatical analysis of an original web page in a network to obtain a sentence having a dependency relationship;extracting nodes of the dependency relationship to obtain a ternary relationship triple; andvalidating reasonableness of the ternary relationship triple, and establishing the ternary relationship library by using the ternary relationship triples the reasonableness of which is validated.    [0047]    Exemplarily, the method further includes, before the sentence having the dependency relationship is obtained:removing content in brackets in the sentence.    [0048]    Exemplarily, the method further includes, before the ternary relationship triple is obtained:adding at least one of a subject, an adverbial, and an object that the sentence having the dependency relationship lacks.    [0049]    Exemplarily, performing search processing for the question by the text library search system includes:performing a search to obtain a document set related to the question;searching the document set for a candidate segment, wherein the candidate segment includes a candidate answer; and extracting the candidate answer from the candidate segment, and performing a first ranking operation.    [0050]    Exemplarily, performing the first ranking operation includes:performing ranking based on at least one feature of a uniform resource locator (URL) weight, an offset weight, and a question matching degree, wherein the URL weight is a weight of a URL link and a site to which a document where the candidate answer is located belongs, the offset weight is a distance coefficient of the candidate answer with respect to a keyword in the question in different candidate segments, and the question matching degree is a semantic matching degree between the candidate answer and the type of the opinion of the question.    [0051]    Exemplarily, returning the answer based on the result of the search processing includes:filtering the result of the search processing by using intra-domain knowledge; andreturning the answer based on the result of the filtering.    [0052]    Exemplarily, returning the answer based on the result of the filtering includes:performing a second ranking operation of the result of the filtering; andreturning the ranked result of the filtering.    [0053]    Exemplarily, performing the second ranking operation of the result of the filtering includes:ranking the result of the filtering by using a supervised machine learning model.    [0054]    Exemplarily, returning the answer based on the result of the filtering includes:performing a third ranking operation of the result of the filtering; andreturning the ranked result of the filtering.    [0055]    Exemplarily, performing the third ranking operation of the result of the filtering includes:validating the matching degree between the candidate answer and the question; andranking the candidate answers based on the matching degrees.    Second embodiment    [0056]    On the basis of the above embodiment, this embodiment provides a technical solution of another method for implementing intelligent QA .     [0057]    Referring to FIG. 2a , the method for implementing intelligent QA provided by this embodiment specifically includes: operations 210 to 240.     [0058]    In the operation 210, a query question is received.     [0059]    In the operation 220, a semantic analysis of the question is performed to know that the type of the opinion of the question is ""previous sentence"" or ""next sentence.""     [0060]    This operation is also applicable to the operation of performing a basic lexical analysis of the question and the operation of identifying a focus, an opinion, and a type of the opinion of the question in the foregoing embodiment, which will not be repeatedly described herein.     [0061]    In the operation 230, the semantic relationship mining system searches the ternary relationship library for an answer to the question.     [0062]    In this operation, ternary relationships in the ternary relationship library encompass dependency relationships using a verb as the core, dependency relationships between entities and attributes and dependency relationships between different entities, and the ternary relationships in the ternary relationship library have passed a reasonableness validation.     [0063]    Referring to FIG. 2b , the ternary relationship library is established preferably by: operations 231 to 236.     [0064]    In the operation 231, preprocessing is performed.     [0065]    Content in brackets such as ""()"" in sentences is removed, so as to avoid affecting the structure of dependency syntax analysis.     [0066]    In the operation 232, a basic lexical/grammatical analysis is performed.     [0067]    Segmentation, proper noun recognition, entity recognition, part-of-speech-tagging and dependency analysis may be performed on a sentence part contained in the text in an original web page, so as to obtain a sentence having a dependency relationship.     [0068]    In the operation 233, adverbial segment identification is performed.     [0069]    For example, segment type identification is performed on segments separated by commas, which are mainly classified into time adverbial segments, non-time adverbial segments and other segments.     [0070]    In the operation 234, ternary relationship triples are extracted.     [0071]    Specifically, this operation is to perform relationship extraction based on each parent node of dependency analysis, to obtain ternary relationship triples. The ternary relationship triples specifically include: dependency relationships using a verb as the core, dependency relationships between entities and attributes and dependency relationships between different entities. For example, in the sentence ""Student A wins an award,"" between ""Student A"" and ""award"" there is a dependency relationship using a verb as the core; in the sentence ""Huangshan Mountain is very beautiful,"" between ""Huangshan Mountain"" and ""very beautiful"" there is a dependency relationship between the entity and the attribute; the next sentence after ""The sun beyond the mountains glows"" is ""The Yellow River seawards flows,"" which may be construed as a dependency relationship between different entities.     [0072]    In the operation 235, a missing element is added.     [0073]    For example, a subject, a time/location adverbial, or an object is added.     [0074]    In the operation 236, reasonableness validation and filtering are performed.     [0075]    It is determined whether the ternary relationship triples obtained through analysis are reasonable. If a ternary relationship triple is not reasonable, the ternary relationship triple will not be kept. That is, filtering is performed on the ternary relationship triples obtained through analysis, so that only ternary relationship triples that are reasonable, i.e., ternary relationship triples that have passed the validation, are kept. Then, the ternary relationship library is established by using the ternary relationship triples that have passed the validation.     [0076]    For example, ""The Yellow River seawards flows, the sun beyond the mountains glows"" is extracted from an original web page, and it has been obtained in the operation 233 through extraction according to the original web page that ""The Yellow River seawards flows"" is the previous sentence of ""the sun beyond the mountains glows."" In this case, it can be determined based on existing poem resources that this ternary relationship triple is not reasonable, and therefore, the ternary relationship triple is filtered out.     [0077]    In the operation 240, an answer is returned based on the result of the search processing.     [0078]    In the technical solution of this embodiment, a semantic analysis of a query question is performed, and based on the semantic analysis, corresponding search processing in a ternary relationship library is performed for the question by using the semantic relationship mining system, so as to find an answer to the question. Because ternary relationships in the ternary relationship library encompass dependency relationships using a verb as the core, dependency relationships between entities and attributes and dependency relationships between different entities, the search scope of answers to questions is increased, and therefore the coverage of questions is expanded. Even moderately to less frequently asked questions and rarely asked questions can be covered. In addition, because the ternary relationships in the ternary relationship library have passed reasonableness validation, answers to questions become more accurate.     [0079]    It should be noted that in the process of setting up the ternary relationship library, the method may further include, before the ternary relationship triples are obtained: adding at least one of a subject, an adverbial, and an object that the sentences having the dependency relationship lack.     [0080]    Specifically, segment types of the sentences having the dependency relationship may be identified, which include: subjects, predicates, objects, adverbials, etc., where the adverbials may be further classified into the following types: time adverbials, location adverbials, reason adverbials, and result adverbials. Verbs act as the predicates. As described above, the dependency syntax analysis is to analyze a sentence to obtain a dependency syntax tree so as to describe the dependency relationship between phrases, and thus the syntactic structure of the sentence is revealed. The dependency syntax analysis advocates that: the core verb in the sentence is the central element governing other elements, the core verb itself is not governed by any other element, and all the governed elements are subordinate to the governor on a particular dependency relationship. The dependency relationship using a verb as the core refers to a dependency relationship between the predicate and segments of other types.     [0081]    In this manner, adding other elements than the predicates that the sentences having the dependency relationship lack can help enrich dependency relationships using a verb as the core in the ternary relationships, thereby further broadening the search scope of answers to questions, and further expanding the coverage of questions. Even moderately frequently and less frequently asked questions and rarely asked questions can be covered.     Third embodiment    [0082]    On the basis of the first embodiment, in this embodiment, the operation of performing corresponding search processing for the question based on the result of the semantic analysis is optimized to be: performing search processing for the question by the text library search system based on the result of the semantic analysis.     [0083]    Referring to FIG. 3 , a flowchart of performing search processing for a question by a text library search system in a method for implementing intelligent QA according to a third embodiment of the present invention is shown. The method specifically includes: operations 310 to 330.     [0084]    In the operation 310, a related document is searched for.     [0085]    A search is performed in a resource library to obtain a search result, a web page text, and click logs, and a document set related to the question is obtained through the search.     [0086]    In this operation, the question may be searched for by using a search engine, to retrieve a related web page set as a document set related to the question. Correlation ranking by the search engine reflects the importance level of each document to some extent. Specifically, the question may be searched for by using the search engine, to obtain search results and other resources related to the question which may include a digest, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), document click data, document text information, etc. Then, document content corresponding to a web page is acquired and retrieved according to the URL, which is used for performing a deep analysis of the questions and answers. The satisfaction level of each document for the question is analyzed through click logs.     [0087]    The click log is used to evaluate, based on the level of the URL, the satisfaction level of each clicked document for the question.     [0088]    The method may further include performing preprocessing, to merge resources that are substantially the same but are expressed using different methods, for example, time ""March 2010"" and ""2010.03;"" and to correct resources that are incorrectly expressed.     [0089]    Preferably, the method may further include document correlation calculation and document ranking.     [0090]    The document correlation may be calculated based on features such as semantic similarity. Calculation of the semantic similarity refers to calculating the value of similarity between the question and document titles. The method for semantic calculation mainly uses information, such as, the importance of the search term, replacement of the search term with synonyms, modification of the search term, etc., for calculation.     [0091]    The document correlation ranking refers to that the search engine retrieves a large number of web page documents based on the search term in the question without limiting its escape risk. In the document correlation ranking method, correlation re-ranking is performed based on the search and ranking result of the search engine (for example, Baidu search engine) and the user satisfaction levels of web pages analyzed in the click logs, and in combination of features such as semantic similarity calculation, so as to solve the content escape problem. Content escape may introduce noise data, resulting in extraction of incorrect answers or in that incorrect answers have a high ranking in the ranking phase.     [0092]    In the operation 320, candidate segments are extracted and ranked.     [0093]    The document set is searched for candidate segments, wherein the candidate segments include candidate answers.     [0094]    First, each document may be segmented. The document segmentation generally takes paragraph or multiple sentences as a unit. Then, a set keyword is searched for in each document so as to obtain segments corresponding to the set keyword as candidate segments, which are further used for locating candidate answers.     [0095]    The candidate segments may further be ranked. Specifically, the confidence of the candidate segment is calculated based on features such as the correlation weight of a source document, content similarity of the candidate segment, and correlation of the candidate segment, and the candidate segments are ranked based on the confidence.     [0096]    The correlation weight of the source document may be calculated by linear fitting of related features of document correlation re-ranking. The content similarity of the candidate segment is used for calculating content similarity between the question and the candidate segment, and may be calculated by using the semantic similarity calculation method. Calculation of the correlation of the candidate segment is used for measuring the correlation between the question and the candidate segment, and the calculation method is mainly to fit features such as the importance of each search term in the question, the number of hits and the positions of hits of each search term in the candidate segment, etc.     [0097]    In the operation 330, candidate answers are extracted and ranked.     [0098]    The candidate answers are extracted from the candidate segments, and a first ranking operation is performed.     [0099]    In this operation, the operation of extracting candidate answers may be implemented by means of the named entity recognition technology using an offline mined open-domain dictionary. The open-domain dictionary is a comprehensive dictionary.     [0100]    The first ranking operation is preferably to perform ranking based on at least one feature of a URL weight, an offset weight, and a question matching degree, wherein the URL weight is a weight of a URL link and a site to which a document where the candidate answer is located belongs, the offset weight is a distance coefficient of the candidate answer with respect to a keyword in the question in different candidate segments, and the question matching degree is a semantic matching degree between the candidate answer and the type of the opinion of the question.     [0101]    Alternatively, the first ranking operation may be performed on the candidate answers based on co-occurrence weights of the candidate answers and the keyword in the question.     [0102]    In addition, the first ranking operation may alternatively be performed on the candidate answers based on at least one of the following features: the position of occurrence of the candidate answer in the candidate segment, inverse document frequency of the candidate answer in the search result, the correlation of the source document, the correlation of a source candidate segment, and confidence-weighted voting weights of different candidate segments for a same answer (including answers having a same meaning).     [0103]    The correlation of the source document may be obtained by linear fitting of related features of the document correlation re-ranking; the correlation of the source candidate segment may be obtained by linear fitting of the correlation of the source document and the semantic matching degree between the source segment and the question.     [0104]    The first ranking operation on the candidate answers is mainly for the purpose of ensuring the retrieve of the candidate answers, and avoiding excessive answers to be ranked in a second ranking operation affecting the ranking performance and noise control.     [0105]    It should be noted that the method may further include, after the candidate answers are extracted and ranked: further ranking the candidate answers, for example, filtering by using intra-domain knowledge, a second ranking operation, a third ranking operation, which will be described in details in conjunction with the following embodiments.     Fourth embodiment    [0106]    On the basis of the above embodiments, this embodiment provides a preferable solution for the operation of returning an answer based on the result of the search processing.     [0107]    Referring to FIG. 4 , a flow chart of returning an answer based on the result of search processing in a method for implementing intelligent QA according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention is shown. The method specifically includes: operations 410 to 420.     [0108]    In the operation 410, the result of the search processing is filtered by using intra-domain knowledge.     [0109]    Knowledge, features and ranking algorithms required by different questions and different types of answers differ. Therefore, the result of the search processing may be filtered by using knowledge of different domains, to obtain a search processing result matching the question.     [0110]    Construction of domain knowledge is mainly construction of a precise domain knowledge dictionary. For example, golden retriever dog is a dog, and black dragon eye goldfish is a fish. If the type of the question is dog, the candidate answer ""black dragon eye goldfish"" will be filtered out by the domain dictionary.     [0111]    Construction of the domain dictionary is mainly implemented by using algorithms such as site-oriented structured data mining (for example, mining novel entities from qidian.com), large-scale Internet unstructured/semi-structured data mining and verifying (for example, mining entities by using classification labels of a knowledge-type community such as Baike), or search logs mining (for example, mining Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils movie entities from search logs corresponding to the question ""Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils Movie"").     [0112]    In the operation 420, the answer is returned based on the result of the filtering.     [0113]    This operation may have multiple implementations, and is described by using the following implementations as examples.     [0114]    In a first implementation, returning the answer based on the result of the filtering specifically includes:performing a second ranking operation of the result of the filtering; andreturning the ranked result of the filtering.    [0115]    The second ranking operation may be performed on the result of the filtering by using a supervised machine learning model (for example, the GBRank machine learning model).     [0116]    The machine learning model is obtained by learning and training statements containing ranked sample answers and corresponding ranking features, and may include at least one of the following ranking features: a question matching degree, offset weight, question-answer co-occurrence information, an answer boundary feature, and answer confidence.     [0117]    The question matching degree is a semantic matching degree between the candidate answer and the type of the opinion of the question. The question matching degree is usually calculated by fitting the matching degree between an extended vector of the question and an extended vector of a candidate answer that are counted from a large scale corpus. The offset weight is a distance coefficient of the candidate answer with respect to a keyword in the question in different candidate segments. The question-answer co-occurrence information is used for measuring the importance level of the question in the primary context of the candidate answer. For the calculation of the entity-type question-answer co-occurrence information, the degree of co-occurrence may be calculated by using information of the candidate answer in Baidu Baike and the keyword in the question. The answer boundary feature refers to information about the left and right boundaries of the answer, for example, guillemet, quotation marks, or a Chinese back-sloping comma. The answer confidence is related to the source document. Each document is considered a source of evidence, and has one vote. Each source document votes once every time. Theoretically, a document with more votes has a higher answer confidence. Alternatively, the answer confidence may be determined based on the candidate segment to which the answer belongs. The document to which individual candidate segment belongs is considered a source of evidence and has one vote, and the weight of each vote of each source is determined by the correlation of the candidate segment. Theoretically, a document with more votes has a higher answer confidence.     [0118]    This implementation may be used alone, or may be used in combination with the foregoing first ranking operation. Preferably, after the candidate answers are extracted from the candidate segments, the first ranking operation is performed, and the filtering operation is carried out by using intra-domain knowledge, the second ranking operation is performed on the result of the filtering.     [0119]    In this preferable implementation, after the candidate answers are extracted from the candidate segments, the first ranking operation is performed by using at least one feature of the URL weight, the offset weight, and the question matching degree, thereby improving the accuracy of top ranked answers; answers corresponding to different categories of questions are filtered by using professional domain knowledge, thereby ensuring the professionalism and authority of answers corresponding to different categories of questions; the second ranking operation is performed on the result of the filtering by using at least one feature of the question matching degree, the offset weight, the question-answer co-occurrence information, the answer boundary feature and the answer confidence, thereby further improving the accuracy of top ranked answers while ensuring the professionalism and authority of the answers corresponding to the questions.     [0120]    In a second implementation, returning the answer based on the result of the filtering specifically includes:performing a third ranking operation on the result of the filtering; andreturning the ranked result of the filtering.    [0121]    Further, performing the third ranking operation on the result of the filtering preferably includes:validating a matching degree between the candidate answers and the question; andranking the candidate answers based on the matching degree.    [0122]    Specifically, a secondary search may be used to validate the matching degree between the candidate answers and the question. The secondary search can provide richer information about match between the question and the answer, and refers to replacing the focus of the original question with the candidate answer, i.e., substituting the candidate answer into the original question to perform a secondary search, and collecting statistics on relevant information about the new question and the candidate answer, for example, whether the new question and the candidate answer appear successively in a document returned by the secondary search, co-occurrence information of the new question and the candidate answer, or information about hits of the keyword in the new question. If the title of a current document is a question-type title, the focus and the answer type are identified from the title of the document. If the question has no focus, the answer is added to the end of the original question and separated by a separator, and then the secondary search is performed.     [0123]    This implementation may be used alone, or may be used in combination with the foregoing first ranking operation and/or the foregoing second ranking operation.     [0124]    When this implementation is used alone, because the candidate answer is substituted into the original question to form a new question for which a secondary search is performed, the order in which the answers are arranged is optimized based on the relevant information about the new question and the candidate answer, so that the matching degree between top ranked answers and the original query question can be improved.     [0125]    After the candidate answers are extracted from the candidate segments, the first ranking operation is performed, and the filtering operation is executed by using intra-domain knowledge, the second ranking operation and the third ranking operation are performed on the result of the filtering. In this implementation, after the candidate answers are extracted from the candidate segments, the first ranking operation is performed by using at least one feature of the URL weight, the offset weight, and the question matching degree, thereby improving the accuracy of top ranked answers; answers corresponding to different categories of questions are filtered by using professional domain knowledge, thereby ensuring the professionalism and authority of the answers corresponding to different categories of questions; the second ranking operation is performed on the result of the filtering by using at least one feature of the question matching degree, the offset weight, the question-answer co-occurrence information, the answer boundary feature and the answer confidence, thereby further improving the accuracy of top ranked answers while ensuring the professionalism and authority of the answers corresponding to the questions; the candidate answer is substituted into the original question to form a new question for which a secondary search is performed, and the order in which the answers are arranged is optimized based on the relevant information about the new question and the candidate answer, thereby further improving the matching degree between top ranked answers and the original query question.     Fifth embodiment    [0126]    This embodiment provides a system for implementing intelligent QA. Referring to FIG. 5 , the system includes: a central control system 510, a question analysis system 520, and a back-end system 530.

Background Art     [0002]    For parallel current-sharing control methods for a conventional high-power switching power supply, such as a master-slave method, a mean value method, and a maximum current method, a maximum current or a mean current is fed back through a current bus, and an error is formed between the maximum current or the mean current and a current in the current bus itself, to adjust a module voltage reference, thereby realizing current sharing, as shown in FIG. 1 . In the current-sharing methods, multiple control loops need to be connected in series, so that the system response becomes slower, especially when multiple power supplies are connected in parallel.     [0003]    In the conventional current-sharing methods, a current bus is required. A module current signal should be integrated into the bus and meanwhile, a bus signal can be transmitted to the modules, to perform amplification of an error between the bus signal and a module current feedback signal, that is to say, signal transmission in current bus is bidirectional. In a scene of serious electromagnetic interference, differential transmission is desired to obtain a high common mode rejection ratio, but two transmitter-receiver sets are required in the differential transmission to enable bidirectional signal transmission, thereby undoubtedly increasing the costs of implementing current sharing through a current bus and the complexity of design and production.     [0004]    For the purpose of improving load regulation and precision of an output voltage, a voltage control module generally needs to be placed outside a parallel system, as shown in FIG. 2 , to perform error amplification on a set reference and a feedback signal of parallel voltage output terminals to generate a total control signal, where the total control signal is unidirectional and can be transmitted to submodules through a differential device as a control reference. If the foregoing conventional current-sharing control method is adopted, two control buses are required in the system to implement remote voltage compensation and module current equalization, thereby undoubtedly increasing the complexity and fault rate of the system.     [0005]    Generally, the module current signal is integrated into the current bus through a diode or resistor, a current bus signal is directly transmitted to an input end of a module error amplifier, and multiple common grounded points exist in the modules, which possibly generates a ground wire loop current, so that a current-sharing loop and even the system are interfered very easily and thus the stability of the system becomes poor.     [0006]    For many control systems, the current-sharing control method is desired to be implemented through both an analog circuit and a digital circuit and applied in both a switching power supply and a linear power supply, so the current-sharing control method needs to be implemented very simply and thus have high flexibility. However, the conventional current-sharing method is relatively complex.     [0007]    In the foregoing conventional current-sharing control method and device, because of a slow system response, multiple control buses are required, which is adverse to differential signal transmission, so that a loop current is easily generated, the anti-interference capability is poor, and the circuit design, production, assembly, and debugging are complex; and the method and the device cannot be flexibly applied to other types of control systems, thereby having a limited application range.      Summary of the Invention     [0008]    The objectives of the present invention are to provide a parallel current-sharing device and control method without a current-sharing bus, solving the following problems of the conventional parallel current-sharing device disposed with an independent current bus: a dual-loop circuit of an outer voltage loop and an inner voltage loop is complex, the multi-parallel dynamic response is slow, the anti-interference capability is poor because of a ground wire loop current, and the design, production, and debugging are complex.     [0009]    In order to achieve the above objectives, the present invention provides a parallel current-sharing control method without a current-sharing bus, for implementing parallel current sharing of direct-current outputs of a plurality of power conversion submodules, wherein a voltage control module and a plurality of power conversion submodules are comprised, the voltage control module and the plurality of power conversion submodules having parallel outputs form an outer voltage loop, the voltage control module samples a terminal voltage signal output by the parallel power conversion submodules and outputs an outer voltage loop control signal to the power conversion submodules, and the power conversion submodules receive the outer voltage loop control signal; the power conversion submodules comprise respective inner current loops and sample respective current feedback signals to generate inner current loop control signals, and the inner current loop control signals are superposed with the outer voltage loop control signal to control output of the power conversion submodules.     [0010]    The terminal voltage signal is compared with a set voltage reference to perform voltage error amplification to generate the outer voltage loop control signal; one part of the outer voltage loop control signal is used as a current error amplification reference of the present power conversion submodule for comparison with the current feedback signal output by the present power conversion submodule to perform current error amplification to generate an inner current loop control signal, the other part of the outer voltage loop control signal is superposed with the inner current loop control signal generated by the present power conversion submodule to generate a superposed control signal of the present power conversion submodule, and the superposed control signal passes through a driving part and a power conversion part of the present power conversion submodule in turn, to control output of the power conversion submodules to realize voltage stabilization and current sharing.     [0011]    The terminal voltage signal and the outer voltage loop control signal are transmitted unidirectionally in a differential mode.     [0012]    The bandwidth of the inner current loop is less than that of the outer voltage loop, and a control loop response speed of the inner current loop is different from that of the outer voltage loop.     [0013]    The power conversion submodule is a switching power supply or a linear power supply, and signal transmission of the outer voltage loop and the inner current loop is controlled by an analog signal or a digital signal.     [0014]    The present invention further provides a parallel current-sharing control device without a current-sharing bus, for implementing parallel current sharing of direct-current outputs of a plurality of power conversion submodules, comprising a voltage control module and a plurality of power conversion submodules, where the plurality of power conversion submodules is connected in parallel, the voltage control module and the plurality of power conversion submodules having parallel outputs form an outer voltage loop, the voltage control module samples a terminal voltage signal output by the plurality of parallel power conversion submodules and outputs an outer voltage loop control signal to the power conversion submodules, and the power conversion submodules receive the outer voltage loop control signal; each power conversion submodule comprises an inner current loop, the inner current loops are not connected by a current bus, the inner current loops sample current feedback signals individually output by the corresponding power conversion submodules respectively, to generate inner current loop control signals, and the inner current loop control signals are superposed with the outer voltage loop control signal to control output of the power conversion submodules.     [0015]    The voltage control module comprises a first differential amplifier, a voltage error amplifier, and a differential driver, where the terminal voltage signal output by the plurality of parallel power conversion submodules is sampled and scaled by the first differential amplifier and then connected to a ""-"" input end of the voltage error amplifier, and a set voltage reference is connected to a ""+"" input end of the voltage error amplifier, to output an error amplified signal; the error amplified signal is differentially output by the differential driver to the power conversion submodules as the outer voltage loop control signal.

[0017]    The voltage control module samples, in a differential mode, the terminal voltage signal output by the plurality of parallel power conversion submodules and unidirectionally outputs the outer voltage loop control signal to the second differential amplifier in a differential mode.     [0018]    In the present invention, an independent current bus and a voltage bus are synthesized into an outer voltage loop control bus, where the control bus is unidirectional and very suitable for differential transmission, so that the system has an excellent interference suppression capability; no inner voltage loop exists in the power conversion submodule, and the voltage control module directly controls the outputs of the power conversion submodules, so that dynamic response of the system is very rapid; the inner current loop in the power conversion submodule forces signals in positive and negative input pins to be equal, to indirectly adjust the output of the outer voltage loop, thereby enabling current sharing of the power conversion submodules; in practice, the bandwidth of the inner current loop may be narrow and the bandwidth of the outer voltage loop may be wide, so that the speed of the outer voltage loop contributes to the dynamic response and current sharing of the inner current loop is acquired in a stable state.     [0019]    The beneficial effects of the present invention are as follows. An independent current bus is not required, and only one unidirectional outer control voltage loop is required.

Detailed Description of the Invention     [0021]    Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below in detail in combination with the accompanying drawings.     [0022]    Embodiment 1: as shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 , the present embodiment provides a parallel current-sharing control device without a current-sharing bus, comprising: a voltage control module 10 and three power conversion submodules 20. The voltage control module 10 comprises a first differential amplifier 101, a voltage error amplifier, and a differential driver 104. The voltage error amplifier comprises a voltage subtracter 102 and a PID regulator 103. A terminal voltage signal totally output by the three parallel power conversion submodules is sampled and scaled by the first differential amplifier 101 and then connected to a ""-"" input end of the voltage subtracter 102 of an outer voltage loop, and a set voltage reference is connected to a ""+"" input end of the voltage subtracter 102, obtaining an error signal. The error signal is amplified by the PID regulator 103, output by the differential driver 104, and connected the three power conversion submodules as an outer voltage loop control signal. Input and output of the outer voltage loop control signal are differential transmission, so that the outer voltage loop has a very high common mode rejection ratio, thereby effectively suppressing noise.     [0023]    Each of the power conversion submodules 20 comprises a current amplifier 201, a current error amplifier, a second differential amplifier 204, an adder 205, a driving signal transformation module 206, and a power conversion module 207. The current error amplifier comprises a current subtracter 202 and a PI regulator 203. The second differential amplifier 204 samples and extracts the outer voltage loop control signal. One part of the outer voltage loop control signal is connected to a ""+"" input end of the current subtracter 202 as a reference of the current subtracter 202, and the other part of the outer voltage loop control signal is connected to the adder 205. An output current Io of the power conversion submodule 20 is scaled by the current amplifier 201 and then connected to a ""-"" input end of the current subtracter 202, obtaining an error signal. The error signal is amplified by the PI regulator 203, outputting an amplified signal. The amplified signal is connected to the adder 205 to be superposed with the outer voltage loop control signal, obtaining a superposed signal. The superposed signal is connected to the driving signal transformation module 206, outputting a driving signal, to drive the power conversion module 207 to perform output control.     [0024]    The superposed signal is input into the driving signal transformation module 206 to generate the driving signal. The driving signal transformation module 206 performs selection according to the type of power supplies. For a switching power supply, a PWM driving signal is generated by a triangular wave comparison circuit; for a linear power supply, a linear control power switch device is scaled. The present embodiment is applicable to a switching power supply or linear power supply with parallel modules, realizing module current sharing.     [0025]    The present embodiment further provides a parallel current-sharing control method without a current-sharing bus, for implementing parallel current sharing of direct-current outputs of a plurality of power conversion submodules. A voltage control module and three power conversion submodules are comprised. The voltage control module and the three power conversion submodules having parallel outputs form an outer voltage loop. The voltage control module samples a terminal voltage signal output by the parallel power conversion submodules and outputs an outer voltage loop control signal to the power conversion submodules. The power conversion submodules receive the outer voltage loop control signal.     [0026]    The power conversion submodules comprise respective inner current loops and sample respective current feedback signals to generate inner current loop control signals, and the inner current loop control signals are superposed with the outer voltage loop control signal to control output of the power conversion submodules.     [0027]    The terminal voltage signal is compared with a set voltage reference to perform voltage error amplification to generate the outer voltage loop control signal; one part of the outer voltage loop control signal is used as a current error amplification reference of the present power conversion submodule for comparison with the current feedback signal output by the present power conversion submodule to perform current error amplification to generate an inner current loop control signal, the other part of the outer voltage loop control signal is superposed with the inner current loop control signal generated by the present power conversion submodule to generate a superposed control signal of the present power conversion submodule, and the superposed control signal passes through a driving part and a power conversion part of the present power conversion submodule in turn, to control output of the power conversion submodules to realize voltage stabilization and current sharing.     [0028]    The terminal voltage signal and the outer voltage loop control signal are transmitted unidirectionally in a differential mode.     [0029]    The bandwidth of the inner current loop is less than that of the outer voltage loop, and a control loop response speed of the inner current loop is different from that of the outer voltage loop.     [0030]    The working principle of the present embodiment is as follows. When one power conversion submodule has a high current and another power conversion submodule has a low current, since the same reference signal is used for the two power conversion submodules, the module having a high current has a small error signal and thus, a current loop thereof generates a small control quantity; on the contrary, the module having a low current has a large error signal and thus, a current loop thereof generates a large control quantity. At this time, it is assumed that the current reference signal is greater than current feedback signals of the two modules and an output voltage is already stable. Since the current errors are positive, current error outputs are positive and superposed with an outer voltage loop control quantity, so that the output voltage is increased. When it is detected in the outer voltage loop that the output voltage is increased, the control quantity is decreased continuously. When the outer voltage loop control quantity is equal to or slightly less than a feedback current of the module having a high current but greater than a feedback current of the module having a low current, the module having a high current begins to have a decreased control quantity and thus a decreased module current, and the module having a low current still has an increased current control quantity and thus an increased current. The outer loop output voltage feedback is still greater than the set voltage reference, the outer voltage loop control quantity is still decreased, the current of the module having a high current is still decreased, and the current of the module having a low current is gradually increased. When input signals of the current error amplifier of the module having a low current are equal, input signals of the current error amplifier of the module having a high current are also equal, thereby obtaining current sharing between modules. It is assumed that the current balance is destroyed in a certain condition. For example, an input voltage of one module is decreased suddenly, so that an output current of the module gets decreased and an output voltage is relatively decreased. In order to reach a set voltage, the outer voltage loop control quantity is increased. Since the outer voltage loop is faster, the output can be stabilized rapidly. An increased current loop reference signal means an increased current error of each module and thus an increased current control quantity. As described above, the outer voltage loop control quantity is decreased, the current control quantity of the module having a high current is decreased, and the current control quantity of the module having a low current is increased, until all current loop inputs are equal, thereby eventually restoring current sharing.     [0031]    Signal transmission in a differential mode in the present embodiment has the following advantages. First, high resistance isolation of the input and output is realized, so that a ground wire loop current does not exist after the modules are connected in parallel, eliminating signal interference and unstable control caused by the loop current. Second, output voltage sampling may need to be performed at a far end to compensate for the output voltage loss caused by wire impedance, so a sampling signal wire is necessarily very long, so that the signal wire is influenced very easily; the differential sampling has an excellent common mode rejection capability, thereby effectively suppressing noise.     [0032]    For current-sharing control (for example, a maximum current method) in the prior art, as shown in FIG. 1 , a current signal is scaled by a current amplifier 201. One part of the scaled signal is input into a ""-"" input end of a current error amplifier, and the other part of the scaled signal is integrated into a current bus through a diode 210. When a present module current Ui1 is greater than an I-Bus voltage, the diode 210 is turned on, and the module begins to control the current bus; when the present module current Ui1 is less than the I-Bus voltage, the diode 210 is not turned on, an output signal of the current error amplifier is positive and superposed to a ""+"" input end of a voltage error amplifier, where the voltage error amplifier comprises a subtracter 208 and a PID regulator 209. A reference signal is increased to increase the present module current. The current bus is bidirectional. The module can transfer a signal to the current bus and a current bus signal can be input into the module, so that it is relatively difficult for a conventional current-sharing control method requiring a current bus to perform differential signal transmission. However, in the present embodiment, only one voltage bus exists and is unidirectional, so that it is very convenient for the system to transmit signals in a differential mode, thereby improving the anti-interference capability of the system.     [0033]    Embodiment 2: as shown in FIG. 3 , in the present embodiment, one voltage control module and one power conversion submodule are comprised, and other technical solutions are similar to Embodiment 1.     [0034]    The working principle of the present embodiment is as follows. When one module runs, it is assumed that, an output voltage is 0 and an output current is 0, and after the voltage control module sets a reference, since an error is very large at this time, a very large outer voltage loop control quantity is generated and transmitted to the power conversion submodule 20. Since an inner current loop is relatively slow and is not sensitive to a reference change. At this time, an outer voltage loop plays a main control role and prompts the output voltage to increase rapidly so that the output voltage is stabilized at a set voltage. The outer voltage loop control quantity is also used as an inner current loop reference. An inner current loop error is positive. A PI operation is performed on the inner current loop error to generate a positive control signal. The positive control signal is superposed on the outer voltage loop. For an already stable output voltage, an increased control quantity necessarily causes an increased output voltage. When it is detected in the outer voltage loop that the output voltage is greater than a set value, an outer voltage loop control quantity is decreased so that the output voltage is decreased, and a reference signal equivalently acting on the current loop is decreased. However, at this time, the current loop error is still positive, the output current is further increased, and the outer voltage loop control quantity is gradually decreased, so that the current loop error signal and control quantity are gradually decreased, and eventually, the outer voltage loop control quantity is equal to an inner current loop feedback current, that is, an outer voltage loop control signal is equal to a module current signal at a stable state. After the present balance is destroyed in a certain condition, for example, a suddenly decreased load, the current is decreased, and the voltage is relatively increased. The outer voltage loop control quantity is decreased rapidly, to decrease the output voltage. If the reference signal of the current error amplifier is still greater than a current feedback signal, the output of the current error amplifier is still increased. The current output is increased, so that the output voltage is still high, so the outer voltage loop control quantity has to be decreased again, until input signals of the current error amplifier are equal, reestablishing a balance.

An air cleaner (200) includes a charging unit (210) for charging particles in the air and a dust collecting unit (220) for collecting the particles charged by the charging unit (210) by an electrostatic force. An indoor unit body (110) houses the upper heat exchanger (131) and the lower heat exchanger (132) and houses the air cleaner (200) of which the center position in the height direction is positioned lower than a connection part (134) between the upper heat exchanger (131) and the lower heat exchanger (132).","Technical Field    [0001]    The present invention relates to an air conditioner.     Background Art    [0002]    There has been an air conditioner having a discharge device provided between a suction port and a heat exchanger (for example, refer to Patent Literature 1). The discharge device charges microparticles in the air.     [0003]    There has been an air conditioner having an electric dust collector provided between a suction port and a heat exchanger (for example, refer to Patent Literatures 2 and 4). The electric dust collector is also referred to as an air cleaner. The electric dust collector charges microparticles in the air, and then, collects the microparticles by an electrostatic force.     Citation List    Patent Literature    [0004]    Patent Literature 1: JP 2014-41754 APatent Literature 2: JP 2005-74389 APatent Literature 3: JP 2000-218192 APatent Literature 4: JP 6-272888 A    Summary of Invention    Technical Problem    [0005]    The traditional electric dust collector (especially, referred to Patent Literature 2) includes a charging unit and a dust collecting unit. The charging unit includes a high-voltage potential discharge electrode and a ground potential counter electrode and charges the microparticles in the passing air. The dust collecting unit includes a high-voltage potential high-voltage electrode and a ground potential counter electrode and collects the microparticles by a suction force of the generated electrostatic force.     [0006]    The high-voltage electrode of the dust collecting unit includes a number of electrodes which are vertically long plate members. The electrodes are provided as having a constant interval in the horizontal direction. The counter electrode of the dust collecting unit includes a number of electrodes which are vertically long plate members. The electrodes are arranged in the horizontal direction so as to be alternately arranged with the counter electrode of the dust collecting unit as having a predetermined interval.     [0007]    The problem is that the ""predetermined interval"" is uneven.     [0008]    The traditional electric dust collector includes power supply components. The traditional electric dust collector further includes a pair of terminals for electrically connecting the dust collecting unit with the power supply component.     [0009]    It is necessary to provide a large space to store the power supply components and the terminals. Therefore, there is a problem in that it is difficult to miniaturize the electric dust collector.     [0010]    The electric dust collector is not removable or electrical connection between the electric dust collector and an indoor unit is troublesome. Therefore, there is a problem in that the electric dust collector is not easily removed/attached.     [0011]    Since the power supply component is positioned in an air trunk, there is a problem in that an efficiency of the air conditioner deteriorates.     [0012]    The traditional electric dust collector (especially, referred to Patent Literature 4) is arranged near the heat exchanger such as a place above the heat exchanger provided in the indoor unit.     [0013]    Therefore, there is a problem in that dew condensation may be generated in the electric dust collector. Also, there is a problem in that the electric dust collector prevents an air flow.     [0014]    An object of the present invention is to improve an efficiency of an air conditioner.     Solution to Problem    [0015]    An air conditioner according to one aspect of the present invention includes:a heat exchanger that is divided into an upper heat exchanger and a lower heat exchanger each of which exchanges heat between air and a refrigerant;an air cleaner that includes a charging unit to charge particles in the air and a dust collecting unit to collect the particles charged by the charging unit by an electrostatic force; andan indoor unit body that houses the heat exchanger and houses the air cleaner of which a center position in a height direction is positioned lower than a connection part between the upper and lower heat exchangers.    Advantageous Effects of Invention    [0016]    In the present invention, the center position of the air cleaner in the height direction is a position lower than the connection part between the upper and lower heat exchangers. Since the air cleaner hardly prevents the air flow, the efficiency of the air conditioner is improved.

Description of Embodiments    [0018]    An embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to the drawings. In the drawings, the same or corresponding parts are denoted with the same reference numerals. In the description of the embodiment, description on the same or corresponding parts is appropriately omitted or simplified. Also, the material, the shape, the size, and the like of a structure of a device, an apparatus, a component, and the like can be appropriately changed within the scope of the present invention.     First embodiment    [0019]    A structure of an appliance according to the present embodiment and an operation of the appliance according to the present embodiment are sequentially described. After that, detail of the present embodiment and an effect of the present embodiment are sequentially described.     *** Description of structure ***    [0020]    A structure of an indoor unit 100 of an air conditioner which is an appliance according to the present embodiment is described with reference to Fig. 1 .     [0021]    As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner includes an indoor unit body 110, a blast fan 120, heat exchangers 131, 132, and 133, a filter 140, a front panel 150, a vertical wind direction variable vane 160, an air cleaner 200, and a filter cleaning device 300.     [0022]    The indoor unit body 110 is a frame body of the air conditioner. The indoor unit body 110 houses the blast fan 120, the heat exchangers 131, 132, and 133, the filter 140, the air cleaner 200, and the filter cleaning device 300. In the present embodiment, the indoor unit body 110 removably houses the filter 140 and the air cleaner 200.     [0023]    The front panel 150 is openably/closably attached on the front surface of the indoor unit body 110. A suction port 111 to suck the air from a room where the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner is placed is provided on a side of the upper surface of the indoor unit body 110. A blowout port 112 to blow out the air into the room is provided on a side of the lower surface of the indoor unit body 110. The vertical wind direction variable vane 160 is rotatably attached to the blowout port 112. Also, a horizontal wind direction variable vane which is not shown is rotatably attached to the back of the blowout port 112.     [0024]    The vertical wind direction variable vane 160 adjusts a vertical direction of an airflow blown from the blowout port 112. The horizontal wind direction variable vane adjusts a horizontal direction of the airflow blown from the blowout port 112.     [0025]    The blast fan 120 is provided in the indoor unit body 110. The blast fan 120 sucks the air and blows out the sucked air. In the present embodiment, the blast fan 120 is a cross flow fan. The blast fan 120 may be changed into a plurality of propeller fans. The propeller fans are aligned in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110. The preferable number of propeller fans is two to four. Each propeller fan may be an axial fan and a mixed flow fan.     [0026]    The heat exchangers 131, 132, and 133 are arranged in the air trunk formed by the blast fan 120. A heat exchanger is divided into an upper heat exchanger and a lower heat exchanger, and is also divided into a front side heat exchanger and a rear side heat exchanger. The heat exchanger 131 corresponds to the upper heat exchanger. The heat exchanger 131 also corresponds to the front side heat exchanger. The heat exchanger 132 corresponds to the lower heat exchanger. The heat exchanger 133 corresponds to the rear side heat exchanger. In the present embodiment, the front side upper heat exchanger 131, the front side lower heat exchanger 132, and the rear side heat exchanger 133 are arranged in the air trunk from the suction port 111 of the indoor unit body 110 to the blowout port 112 so as to surround the blast fan 120. The rear side heat exchanger 133 may be omitted, and only the upper and lower heat exchangers 131 and 132 may be employed. Alternatively, a heat exchanger having other structure may be employed.     [0027]    The front side upper heat exchanger 131, the front side lower heat exchanger 132, and the rear side heat exchanger 133 each exchange heat between the air and a refrigerant. The air is mainly sucked from the suction port 111 by the blast fan 120. The front side upper heat exchanger 131, the front side lower heat exchanger 132, and the rear side heat exchanger 133 each cool, heat or dehumidify the air by exchanging the heat.     [0028]    A drain pan 113 to collect dew condensation water is arranged below the front side lower heat exchanger 132. A drain pan 114 is arranged below the rear side heat exchanger 133. The drain pans 113 and 114 are formed as a part of the indoor unit body 110.     [0029]    The filter 140 is arranged between the suction port 111 of the indoor unit body 110 and the front side upper heat exchanger 131 and the rear side heat exchanger 133 so as to cover the whole suction port 111. In the present embodiment, the number of the filters 140 is two. The filters 140 are arranged as being divided into left and right. Each filter 140 captures dust in the air. The air is mainly sucked from the suction port 111 by the blast fan 120.     [0030]    The filter cleaning device 300 is arranged between the front side upper and lower heat exchangers 131 and 132 and the front panel 150. The filter cleaning device 300 is placed for each filter 140. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the number of filter cleaning devices 300 is two. The filter cleaning device 300 automatically cleans the filter 140.     [0031]    The number of filters 140 can be appropriately changed. The number of filter cleaning devices 300 can be changed according to the number of filters 140. That is, when the single filter 140 is used, the single filter cleaning device 300 is placed. When three or more filters 140 are used, three or more filter cleaning devices 300 are placed.     [0032]    The filter cleaning device 300 includes a device body 310 and a dust box 320.     [0033]    The device body 310 movably houses the filter 140.     [0034]    The dust box 320 is removably attached to the front surface of the device body 310. The dust box 320 accumulates the dusts captured by the filter 140.     [0035]    The indoor unit body 110 houses the air cleaner 200 behind the dust box 320. Therefore, an insertion port 311 is provided in the front surface of the device body 310, and both the air cleaner 200 and the dust box 320 are inserted into the insertion port 311. The air cleaner 200 is inserted into the insertion port 311 in a direction in which the longitudinal direction of the air cleaner 200 becomes horizontal. After being inserted into the insertion port 311, the air cleaner 200 is electrically connected to a terminal for power supply to be described by moving the air cleaner 200 downward, and the air cleaner 200 is attached to the indoor unit body 110. In this state, the longitudinal direction of the air cleaner 200 is horizontal. By moving the air cleaner 200 upward, the electrical connection between the air cleaner 200 and the terminal is released.After the electrical connection has been released, the air cleaner 200 is removed through the insertion port 311 to outside of the indoor unit body 110.     [0036]    The air cleaner 200 is provided in a space between the suction port 111 of the indoor unit body 110 and the front side upper and lower heat exchangers 131 and 132. That is, the air cleaner 200 is arranged on the upstream side of the front side upper and lower heat exchangers 131 and 132 in the air trunk formed by the blast fan 120. In the present embodiment, the number of air cleaners 200 is one. The air cleaner 200 is arranged on the left side. The air cleaner 200 cleans the air which has passed through the filter 140. The size of the air cleaner 200 in the horizontal direction is preferably the same as that of the filter 140. When a difference between the size of the air cleaner 200 in the horizontal direction and that of the filter 140 is equal to or less than six cm, the two sizes can be assumed to be equal to each other.     [0037]    The number of air cleaners 200 can be appropriately changed. The air cleaners 200 may be arranged on both the left and right sides.     [0038]    In the present embodiment, the indoor unit body 110 houses the air cleaner 200 by positioning the center position of the air cleaner 200 in the height direction at a position lower than the connection part 134 between the upper heat exchanger 131 and the lower heat exchanger 132. Therefore, the air cleaner 200 hardly prevents the air flow. Also, the air cleaner 200 is easily attached/removed. The height direction of the air cleaner 200 means the vertical direction of the air cleaner 200.     [0039]    The indoor unit body 110 houses the air cleaner 200 in front of and apart from the heat exchangers 131 and 132. Therefore, a metal part of the air cleaner 200 such as a terminal to be described is hardly cooled. Also, the dew condensation water of the heat exchangers 131 and 132 does not flow into the air cleaner 200. Therefore, the dew condensation hardly occurs in the air cleaner 200.     [0040]    In the present embodiment, the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner further includes a restriction unit 170.     [0041]    The restriction unit 170 restricts a range in which the air cleaner 200 can enter the indoor unit body 110 in the depth direction in order to prevent contact between the air cleaner 200 and the heat exchangers 131 and 132. The depth direction of the indoor unit body 110 means the front-back direction of the indoor unit body 110.     [0042]    The air cleaner 200 includes a charging unit 210, a dust collecting unit 220, and a frame part 230.     [0043]    The charging unit 210 charges particles in the air. Mainly, the air has passed through a filter 140 after being sucked from the suction port 111 by the blast fan 120. Specifically, the particles in the air are bacteria, molds, and virus in the air.     [0044]    The dust collecting unit 220 collects the particles charged by the charging unit 210 by using the electrostatic force. The electrostatic force is an electric field.     [0045]    The frame part 230 fixes the charging unit 210 and the dust collecting unit 220.     *** Description of operation ***    [0046]    An operation of the air conditioner according to the present embodiment is described.     [0047]    When the power is turned on, in an outdoor unit of the air conditioner which is not shown, a compressor compresses the refrigerant and discharges it.     [0048]    In the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner, the refrigerant discharged from the compressor is flown into the heat exchangers 131, 132, and 133. When the blast fan 120 rotates, the heat of indoor air sucked from the suction port 111 is exchanged with the refrigerant by the heat exchangers 131, 132, and 133 after the dust has been removed via the filter 140. At this time, the air which passes though the heat exchangers 131, 132, and 133 from the upstream to the downstream is cleaned by the air cleaner 200.     [0049]    The indoor air heat exchanged by the heat exchangers 131, 132, and 133 is blown from the blowout port 112 into the room. At this time, the air is blown out in the direction according to the angles of the vertical wind direction variable vane 160 and the horizontal wind direction variable vane. A user of the air conditioner can set the angles of the vertical wind direction variable vane 160 and the horizontal wind direction variable vane by hand or by using a remote controller. When the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner includes an infrared sensor which is not shown, the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner detects temperature distribution and a position of a person in the room so that the angles of the vertical wind direction variable vane 160 and the horizontal wind direction variable vane can be automatically adjusted.     [0050]    The series of operations is repeated. As a result, the dust is removed from the indoor air, and the indoor air is continuously cooled and warmed. Accordingly, an indoor air quality is changed.     *** Description of detail ***    [0051]    The detail of the present embodiment is described.     [0052]    A structure of the air cleaner 200 is described with reference to Figs. 2 to 8 .     [0053]    Fig. 2 is a diagram of the air cleaner 200 viewed obliquely from above and front side. Fig. 3 is a diagram of the air cleaner 200 viewed obliquely from below and front side. Fig. 4 is a diagram of the air cleaner 200 viewed from just below. Fig. 5 is a diagram of a cross section of the air cleaner 200 cut along an A-A line in Fig. 4 . Fig. 6 is a diagram of the disassembled air cleaner 200 viewed obliquely from above and front side. Fig. 7 is a diagram of the air cleaner 200 of which an upper frame 231 to be described is removed viewed from right above. Fig. 8 is a diagram of a lower frame 232 to be described viewed from right above.     [0054]    As described above, the air cleaner 200 includes the charging unit 210, the dust collecting unit 220, and the frame part 230. The air cleaner 200 further includes a prefilter 240.     [0055]    The prefilter 240 captures the dust which cannot be captured by the filter 140.     [0056]    The charging unit 210 is arranged below the prefilter 240, that is, on the downstream side of the prefilter 240. The charging unit 210 includes a discharge electrode 211 and a counter electrode 212.     [0057]    The discharge electrode 211 includes a pair of ring-shaped terminals 213, a pair of tubes 214, and a single wire 215. The ring-shaped terminals 213 are connected to both sides of the wire 215. The tube 214 covers a connection part between the ring-shaped terminal 213 and the wire 215. A spring 216 is hooked to one ring-shaped terminal 213.     [0058]    The counter electrode 212 includes a plurality of planar electrodes 217. The planar electrodes 217 are arranged in a third direction D3 with intervals from each other. The third direction D3 is described below. The wire 215 is provided between the planar electrodes 217 adjacent to each other. In the present embodiment, the number of planar electrodes 217 is three. Therefore, the wire 215 passes between the planar electrode 217 at the end in the third direction D3 and the planar electrode 217 in the middle in the third direction D3 and then folded back. After that, the wire 215 passes between the planar electrode 217 in the middle in the third direction D3 and the planar electrode 217 at the other end in the third direction D3.     [0059]    The number of planar electrodes 217 can be appropriately changed. The number of times of folding of the wire 215 can be changed according to the number of planar electrodes 217.     [0060]    The charging unit 210 generates the electric field by applying different voltages to the discharge electrode 211 and the counter electrode 212. The charging unit 210 charges the particles in the air passing through the electric field.     [0061]    The voltage to be applied to the discharge electrode 211 is high. Specifically, a voltage of 6000 volts is applied to the discharge electrode 211. The voltage to be applied to the counter electrode 212 is low. Specifically, a voltage of zero volts is applied to the counter electrode 212. That is, the counter electrode 212 is grounded.     [0062]    The dust collecting unit 220 is arranged below the charging unit 210, that is, on the downstream side of the charging unit 210. The dust collecting unit 220 includes a first electrode 221 and a second electrode 222.     [0063]    A plurality of first plate-shaped electrodes 223 and a first connection member 225 are provided in the first electrode 221. The first plate-shaped electrodes 223 are arranged in a first direction D1 with intervals from each other. In the present embodiment, the first direction D1 is the horizontal direction of the air cleaner 200. When the air cleaner 200 is housed in the indoor unit body 110, the horizontal direction of the air cleaner 200 coincides with that of the indoor unit body 110. In the present embodiment, the number of first plate-shaped electrodes 223 is 37. The first connection member 225 couples the first plate-shaped electrodes 223 with each other. Accordingly, the plurality of first plate-shaped electrodes 223 is integrally provided in the first electrode 221.     [0064]    A first terminal 227 is attached to one end of the first electrode 221 in the first direction D1. Specifically, the first terminal 227 is attached to the right end of the first electrode 221.     [0065]    A plurality of second plate-shaped electrodes 224 and a second connection member 226 are provided in the second electrode 222. The second plate-shaped electrodes 224 and the first plate-shaped electrodes 223 are alternately arranged with intervals from each other. That is, the second plate-shaped electrodes 224 are arranged with intervals from each other in the first direction D1 similarly to the first plate-shaped electrodes 223. In the present embodiment, the number of second plate-shaped electrodes 224 is 38 which is one more than the number of first plate-shaped electrodes 223. The second connection member 226 couples the second plate-shaped electrodes 224 with each other. Accordingly, the plurality of second plate-shaped electrodes 224 is integrally provided in the second electrode 222. The second connection member 226 is overlapped with the first connection member 225 in a second direction D2. The second direction D2 is a direction perpendicular to the first direction D1. In the present embodiment, the second direction D2 is the vertical direction of the air cleaner 200. When the air cleaner 200 is housed in the indoor unit body 110, the vertical direction of the air cleaner 200 coincides with that of the indoor unit body 110.     [0066]    A second terminal 228 is attached to one end of the second electrode 222 in the first direction D1. Specifically, the second terminal 228 is attached to the right end of the second electrode 222. The second terminal 228 is attached at a position separated from the first terminal 227 in the third direction D3. The third direction D3 is a direction perpendicular to both the first direction D1 and the second direction D2. In the present embodiment, the third direction D3 is the front-back direction of the air cleaner 200. When the air cleaner 200 is housed in the indoor unit body 110, the front-back direction of the air cleaner 200 coincides with that of the indoor unit body 110.     [0067]    As described above, the air cleaner 200 is arranged at a position in front of the heat exchangers 131 and 132 and separated from the heat exchangers 131 and 132. The air vertically flows at this position. Also, as described above, the air cleaner 200 is attached to the indoor unit body 110 in a direction in which the longitudinal direction of the air cleaner 200 becomes horizontal. The direction in which a plate face of the planar electrode 217 extends, the direction in which a plate face of the first plate-shaped electrode 223 extends, and the direction in which a plate face of the second plate-shaped electrode 224 extends are the second direction D2. Therefore, when the air cleaner 200 is attached to the indoor unit body 110, the direction in which the plate face of the planar electrode 217 extends, the direction in which the plate face of the first plate-shaped electrode 223 extends, and the direction in which the plate face of the second plate-shaped electrode 224 extends are vertical. That is, when the air cleaner 200 is attached to the indoor unit body 110, all of the plate face of the planar electrode 217, the plate face of the first plate-shaped electrode 223, and the plate face of the second plate-shaped electrode 224 are extended along the direction in which the air flows. Therefore, the planar electrode 217, the first plate-shaped electrode 223, and the second plate-shaped electrode 224 hardly prevent the flow of the air, and the efficiency of the air conditioner is improved.     [0068]    The number of first plate-shaped electrodes 223 can be appropriately changed. The number of second plate-shaped electrodes 224 can be changed according to the number of first plate-shaped electrodes 223.     [0069]    The dust collecting unit 220 generates the electrostatic force by applying different voltages to the first electrode 221 and the second electrode 222 respectively via the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228. The dust collecting unit 220 collects the particles charged by the charging unit 210 by using the electrostatic force.     [0070]    The voltage to be applied to the first electrode 221 is high. Specifically, a voltage of 6000 volts is applied to the first electrode 221. The voltage to be applied to the second electrode 222 is low. Specifically, a voltage of zero volts is applied to the second electrode 222. That is, the second electrode 222 is grounded.     [0071]    In this way, the voltage to be applied to the first electrode 221 of the dust collecting unit 220 is the same as the voltage to be applied to the discharge electrode 211 of the charging unit 210. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the first terminal 227 of the dust collecting unit 220 and the ring-shaped terminal 213 of the charging unit 210 are electrically connected to each other. Specifically, a pair of notches 229 is provided in the first terminal 227 of the dust collecting unit 220. One ring-shaped terminal 213 of the charging unit 210 is hooked to one notch 229. The spring 216 hooked to the other ring-shaped terminal 213 of the charging unit 210 is hooked to the other notch 229. Accordingly, the voltage can be applied to the first electrode 221 of the dust collecting unit 220 and the discharge electrode 211 of the charging unit 210 from a common power supply.     [0072]    Also, the voltage to be applied to the second electrode 222 of the dust collecting unit 220 is the same as the voltage to be applied to the counter electrode 212 of the charging unit 210. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the second electrode 222 of the dust collecting unit 220 and the counter electrode 212 of the charging unit 210 are integrally molded. That is, the second terminal 228 of the dust collecting unit 220 is used as a terminal to apply the voltage to the counter electrode 212 of the charging unit 210. Accordingly, the voltage can be applied to the second electrode 222 of the dust collecting unit 220 and the counter electrode 212 of the charging unit 210 from the common power supply. Also, the number of components can be reduced. The second electrode 222 of the dust collecting unit 220 and the counter electrode 212 of the charging unit 210 may be individually formed. In this case, the second electrode 222 of the dust collecting unit 220 and the counter electrode 212 of the charging unit 210 may be electrically connected to each other, and the power may be individually supplied to the second electrode 222 and the counter electrode 212.     [0073]    The first electrode 221 is formed of an antistatic resin having electric conductivity and a resistance value equal to or less than 10<11>/cm<2>. The second electrode 222 is formed by plating metal to the resin. The second electrode 222 may be formed of a metal plate such as stainless and may be formed of conductive resin having the resistance value equal to or less than 10<3>/cm<2>and including carbon. The first terminal 227 attached to the first electrode 221 and the second terminal 228 attached to the second electrode 222 are formed of metal. Also, the ring-shaped terminal 213, the wire 215, and the spring 216 of the discharge electrode 211 are formed of metal. The tube 214 of the discharge electrode 211 has a double-layer structure including an outer layer formed of resin and an inner layer which is adhesive.     [0074]    In the present embodiment, the first terminal 227 extends in a range from one end of the first electrode 221 in the first direction D1 to both ends of the first electrode 221 in the third direction D3. That is, the first terminal 227 does not protrude from the both sides of the first electrode 221 in the third direction D3. Similarly, the second terminal 228 extends in a range from one end of the second electrode 222 in the first direction D1 to both ends of the second electrode 222 in the third direction D3. That is, the second terminal 228 does not protrude from the both sides of the second electrode 222 in the third direction D3. Therefore, the size of the air cleaner 200 in the third direction D3 can be reduced.     [0075]    The first terminal 227 is attached to a first feeding unit 273 provided at one end of the first electrode 221 in the first direction D1. The first feeding unit 273 extends outward in the first direction D1 from a position separated from the sides of the first electrode 221 on both ends in the third direction D3 on one end surface of the first electrode 221 in the first direction D1. In the present embodiment, a right end surface of the first electrode 221 has a rectangular shape formed of two long sides and two short sides, and the two short sides correspond to the sides on the both ends in the third direction D3. That is, in the present embodiment, the first feeding unit 273 extends to the right side from a position other than the short sides on the right end surface of the first electrode 221. Therefore, the voltage to be applied via the first terminal 227 is applied to the right end surface of the first electrode 221 from the position separated from the short sides on the right end surface of the first electrode 221 not the short sides of the right end surface of the first electrode 221. Therefore, a difference between the voltages applied to the front and rear sides of the first electrode 221 can be reduced. That is, a distribution of the potential of the first electrode 221 in the third direction D3 can be made closer to being even.     [0076]    The second terminal 228 is attached to a second feeding unit 274 provided at one end of the second electrode 222 in the first direction D1. The one end of the first electrode 221 in the first direction D1 where the first feeding unit 273 is provided is positioned outer in the first direction D1 than the one end of the second electrode 222 in the first direction D 1. The second feeding unit 274 extends outward in the first direction D1 from one end surface of the second electrode 222 in the first direction D1 and goes through a position separated in the second direction D2 from the one end of the first electrode 221 in the first direction D1. In the present embodiment, the right end which is the one end of the first electrode 221 in the first direction D 1 is formed of the right end of the first connection member 225. Also, the right end which is the one end of the second electrode 222 in the first direction D 1 is formed of the second plate-shaped electrode 224 on the most right side, the right end of the second connection member 226, and the right end of the counter electrode 212. A gap 275 is formed between the right end of the first connection member 225 and the first plate-shaped electrode 223 on the most right side. The second plate-shaped electrode 224 on the most right side is inserted into the gap 275 so that the right end of the first connection member 225 is placed on the right side of the second plate-shaped electrode 224 on the most right side. That is, the right end of the first electrode 221 is placed outer than the right end of the second electrode 222 in the horizontal direction of the air cleaner 200. The second feeding unit 274 extends to the right side from at least one of the plate face of the second plate-shaped electrode 224 on the most right side and the right end surface of the second connection member 226 and passes above the right end of the first connection member 225. That is, in the present embodiment, the second feeding unit 274 extends outward from the right end surface of the second electrode 222 in the horizontal direction of the air cleaner 200 and goes through the position separated from the right end of the first electrode 221 in the vertical direction of the air cleaner 200. Therefore, the first terminal 227 is not connected to the front surface of the first electrode 221, and the second terminal 228 is not connected to the front surface of the second electrode 222. The first terminal 227 can be connected to the right end surface of the first electrode 221 while connecting the second terminal 228 to the right end surface of the second electrode 222. Therefore, the size of the air cleaner 200 in the third direction D3 can be reduced.     [0077]    Since the first electrode 221 is formed of antistatic resin, spark does not occur even when the second feeding unit 274 is provided near the right end of the first electrode 221. Therefore, the size of the air cleaner 200 in the second direction D2 can be reduced by employing a structure in which the second feeding unit 274 is provided near the right end of the first electrode 221.     [0078]    The first terminal 227 includes a first extended part 251, a first curved part 253, a first end 255, a third curved part 257, and a pair of erected parts 258. The first extended part 251 is a part extended from the one end of the first electrode 221 in the first direction D1. The first curved part 253 is a part curved from the first extended part 251 in the third direction D3. The first end 255 is a part extended from the first curved part 253. The first end 255 has a flat plate shape and is arranged to have the thickness in the first direction D1. The first end 255 includes a plate face 271 for power supply. The third curved part 257 is a part curved from the upper end of the first end 255 in the first direction D1. The erected part 258 is a part erected from the third curved part 257. The notch 229 is provided in each erected part 258.     [0079]    The second terminal 228 includes a second extended part 252, a second curved part 254, and a second end 256. The second extended part 252 is a part extended from the one end of the second electrode 222 in the first direction D1. The second curved part 254 is a part curved from the second extended part 252 in the second direction D2. The second end 256 is a part extended from the second curved part 254. The second end 256 has a flat plate shape and is arranged to have the thickness in the first direction D1. The second end 256 includes a plate face 272 for power supply. The second end 256 is arranged with an interval with the first end 255 in the first direction D1. It is preferable that the interval is wide so as not to generate tracking even when water drops enter the air cleaner 200, and specifically, it is preferable that the width of the interval be equal to or more than two cm.     [0080]    The frame part 230 has an upper frame 231 and a lower frame 232.     [0081]    As described above, the air cleaner 200 is arranged at a position in front of the heat exchangers 131 and 132 and separated from the heat exchangers 131 and 132. The air vertically flows at this position. Also, as described above, the air cleaner 200 is attached to the indoor unit body 110 in a direction in which the longitudinal direction of the air cleaner 200 becomes horizontal. A direction in which the front and rear surfaces of the upper frame 231 extend and a direction in which the front and rear surfaces of the lower frame 232 extend are the second direction D2. Therefore, when the air cleaner 200 is attached to the indoor unit body 110, both the direction in which the front and rear surfaces of the upper frame 231 extend and the direction in which the front and rear surfaces of the lower frame 232 extend are vertical. That is, when the air cleaner 200 is attached to the indoor unit body 110, the front and rear surfaces of the upper frame 231 and the front and rear surfaces of the lower frame 232 extend along the direction of the air flow. Therefore, an outline of the upper frame 231 and an outline of the lower frame 232 hardly prevent the flow of the air, and the efficiency of the air conditioner is improved. Also, since the rear surface of the upper frame 231 and the rear surface of the lower frame 232 are vertical surfaces, the air cleaner 200 can be compactly housed in front of the heat exchangers 131 and 132. That is, a space deep in the indoor unit body 110 can be effectively used.     [0082]    A handle 233 is provided on the front surface of the upper frame 231. An opening 234 is provided in the upper surface of the upper frame 231. The prefilter 240 is fitted into the opening 234.     [0083]    A rib 235 and an opening 236 are provided in the lower surface of the lower frame 232. A slit 237 is provided in the upper surface of the rib 235. In the present embodiment, the slit 237 does not pass through the rib 235 in the second direction D2. That is, the slit 237 is a groove having a bottom surface. At least a part of the opening 236 is divided by the rib 235. In the present embodiment, the opening 236 is completely divided by the rib 235. That is, the rib 235 crosses the opening 236. The cross direction of the rib 235 is the third direction D3. In the present embodiment, the number of ribs 235 is one.     [0084]    At least a part of any one of the first plate-shaped electrodes 223 is fitted into the slit 237 of the rib 235. The other first plate-shaped electrodes 223 of the first plate-shaped electrodes 223 are exposed on both sides of the rib 235 through the opening 236. In the present embodiment, at least a part of the first plate-shaped electrode 223 at the center of the plurality of first plate-shaped electrodes 223 is fitted into the slit 237 of the rib 235. Specifically, the lower end part of the first plate-shaped electrode 223 at the center is fitted into the slit 237 of the rib 235. Accordingly, the first electrode 221 is positioned.     [0085]    As described above, in the dust collecting unit 220, the second plate-shaped electrodes 224 are alternately arranged with the intervals from the first plate-shaped electrodes 223. Therefore, the plurality of second plate-shaped electrodes 224 is further exposed on both sides of the rib 235 through the opening 236.     [0086]    The plate-shaped electrode fitted into the slit 237 of the rib 235 is not limited to the first plate-shaped electrode 223 and may be the second plate-shaped electrode 224.     [0087]    Also, the number of ribs 235 can be appropriately changed. When the two ribs 235 are provided, at least a part of the two first plate-shaped electrodes 223 may be respectively fitted into the slits 237 of the two ribs 235, and at least a part of the first plate-shaped electrode 223 and at least a part of the second plate-shaped electrode 224 may be respectively fitted into the slits 237 of the two ribs 235. Also, at least a part of the two second plate-shaped electrodes 224 may be respectively fitted into the slits 237 of the two ribs 235.     [0088]    The slit 237 may pass through in the second direction D2. That is, the slit 237 may be a hole having no bottom surface. When the slit 237 is the groove and the hole, two inner wall surfaces are formed in the slit 237.     [0089]    When both the inner wall surfaces of the slit 237 are flat, an interval between the inner wall surfaces is needed to be the same as the thickness of the plate-shaped electrode to be inserted or to be wider than the thickness of the plate-shaped electrode to be inserted. When the interval is the same as the thickness of the plate-shaped electrode, the plate-shaped electrode can be fixed by sandwiching the plate-shaped electrode between both the inner wall surfaces.     [0090]    When the inner wall surface of one slit 237 is flat and the inner wall surface of other slit 237 has a single or plurality of projections, an interval between the inner wall surfaces is needed to be the same as the thickness of the plate-shaped electrode to be inserted or to be wider than the thickness of the plate-shaped electrode to be inserted. When the interval is the same as the thickness of the plate-shaped electrode, the plate-shaped electrode can be fixed by sandwiching the plate-shaped electrode between the one inner wall surface and the projection of the other inner wall surface.     [0091]    When both the inner wall surfaces of the slit 237 are not flat and both the inner wall surfaces have the single or plurality of projections, an interval between the projections of both the inner wall surfaces is needed to be the same as the thickness of the plate-shaped electrode to be inserted or to be wider than the plate-shaped electrode to be inserted. When the interval is the same as the thickness of the plate-shaped electrode, the plate-shaped electrode can be fixed by sandwiching the plate-shaped electrode between the projections of both the inner wall surfaces.     [0092]    In the present embodiment, one side surface of the rib 235 has a projection 238. The projection 238 has contact with a side surface of any one of the second plate-shaped electrodes 224. In the present embodiment, the projection 238 on the one side surface of the rib 235 has contact with the side surface of the second plate-shaped electrode 224 on the left side of the first plate-shaped electrode 223 at the center. Accordingly, the second electrode 222 is also positioned.     [0093]    It is preferable that the projections 238 on the one side surface of the rib 235 be provided at least at two places on the one side surface of the rib 235. In the present embodiment, the projections 238 are provided at two places on the one side surface of the rib 235.     [0094]    In the present embodiment, similarly to the one side surface of the rib 235, the other side surface of the rib 235 has a projection 239. The projection 239 has contact with the side surface of any other second plate-shaped electrode 224 of the plurality of second plate-shaped electrodes 224. In the present embodiment, the projection 239 on the other side surface of the rib 235 has contact with the side surface of the second plate-shaped electrode 224 on the right of the first plate-shaped electrode 223 at the center. Accordingly, the second electrode 222 is surely positioned.     [0095]    It is preferable that the projections 239 on the other side surface of the rib 235 be provided at least at two places on the other side surface of the rib 235. In the present embodiment, the projections 239 are provided at two places on the other side surface of the rib 235.     [0096]    The frame part 230 further includes a middle frame 259.     [0097]    The middle frame 259 is fitted to the upper surface of the lower frame 232 on a side of one end in the first direction D1. Specifically, the middle frame 259 covers the lower frame 232 so as to cover from the edge of the opening 236 to the end of the lower frame 232 in the first direction D1. Accordingly, the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 are covered with the middle frame 259.     [0098]    A protruding part which is not shown is provided on the lower surface of the middle frame 259. The protruding part seals a space between the first end 255 of the first terminal 227 and the second end 256 of the second terminal 228 arranged in the first direction D1. Accordingly, even when water drops enter the air cleaner 200, the generation of the tracking between the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 can be prevented.     [0099]    In the present embodiment, the lower frame 232 has a first hole 261 and a second hole 262. The first end 255 of the first terminal 227 passes through the first hole 261 in the second direction D2, and the second end 256 of the second terminal 228 passes through the second hole 262 in the second direction D2. The second hole 262 is separated from the first hole 261. As in the description regarding the interval between the first end 255 and the second end 256, it is preferable that the interval between the first hole 261 and the second hole 262 be wide so as not to generate the tracking.     [0100]    The lower frame 232 further includes a groove 263 which is connected to the first hole 261 and is separated from the second hole 262. The first extended part 251 of the first terminal 227 is fitted into the groove 263. In the present embodiment, the first curved part 253 of the first terminal 227 passes through the first hole 261 together with the first end 255. However, the first curved part 253 may be fitted into the groove 263 together with the first extended part 251.     [0101]    On the lower surface of the lower frame 232, a first restriction unit 277 which is a partition wall is provided in front of the first hole 261. A second restriction unit 278 which is a partition wall is provided in front of the second hole 262, and the position of the wall surface of the second restriction unit 278 in the third direction D3 is the same as that of the first restriction unit 277. Functions of the first restriction unit 277 and the second restriction unit 278 are described below.     [0102]    A structure of the filter cleaning device 300 is described with reference to Figs. 9 to 23 .     [0103]    As described above, the filter cleaning device 300 includes the device body 310 and the dust box 320.     [0104]    As illustrated in Fig. 9 , the power supply unit 400 is fixed in a lower part on the front surface of the device body 310. The power supply unit 400 applies the voltage to generate the electrostatic force to the dust collecting unit 220 of the air cleaner 200.     [0105]    As described above, in the present embodiment, the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner further includes the power supply unit 400. The indoor unit body 110 houses the power supply unit 400 in a lower part on the front surface.     [0106]    Fig. 10 is a diagram of the filter cleaning device 300 of which the dust box 320 on the left side has been removed.     [0107]    A part of the device body 310 forms a supporting part 500. The supporting part 500 supports the air cleaner 200.     [0108]    As described above, in the present embodiment, the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner further includes the supporting part 500. The indoor unit body 110 houses the supporting part 500 and houses the air cleaner 200 by supporting it by the supporting part 500.     [0109]    Another part of the device body 310 forms a main receiving part 315. The main receiving part 315 supports the dust box 320.     [0110]    Still another part of the device body 310 forms the restriction unit 170 which is a partition wall. As described above, the restriction unit 170 restricts a range in which the air cleaner 200 enters the indoor unit body 110 in the depth direction. In the present embodiment, the restriction unit 170 restricts not only the range of the indoor unit body 110 in the depth direction but also a range in which the air cleaner 200 can move in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110. The device body 310 includes a mechanism for restricting the range in which the filter 140 can move in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110. The restriction unit 170 is positioned below the mechanism. It is preferable that the range of the movement of the filter 140 restricted by the mechanism be the same as the range of the movement of the air cleaner 200 restricted by the restriction unit 170. That is, it is preferable that the restriction unit 170 restrict the range in which the air cleaner 200 can move in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110 to be the same as the range in which the filter 140 can move in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110. When the size of the filter 140 in the horizontal direction is the same as that of the air cleaner 200, the air which has passed through the filter 140 can be efficiently flown into the air cleaner 200 by adjusting the positions of the filter 140 and the air cleaner 200 to be the same. Also, a range in which an obstacle exists in the horizontal direction can be reduced by vertically arranging the right end of the mechanism to be the obstacle of wind vertically flown and the right end of the restriction unit 170.     [0111]    At least a part of the power supply unit 400 is arranged just below the supporting part 500. This can shorten the wiring from the power supply unit 400 to the supporting part 500 to be described. Since the high voltage is applied from the power supply unit 400 to the dust collecting unit 220 of the air cleaner 200, it is necessary to provide wiring by using an expensive cable. Therefore, when the wiring can be shortened, the cost can be reduced. Even when the power supply unit 400 is not arranged below the supporting part 500, the same effect can be obtained in a case where the power supply unit 400 is arranged adjacent to the supporting part 500. Therefore, as in the present embodiment, when the air cleaner 200 is held at the right end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the left side, it is preferable that the power supply unit 400 be arranged adjacent to the right end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the left side. In the present embodiment, the power supply unit 400 is arranged at the center of the indoor unit body 110 in the horizontal direction, and this place corresponds to the place adjacent to the right end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the left side. When the air cleaner 200 is held at the left end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the right side, it is preferable that the power supply unit 400 be arranged adjacent to the left end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the right side. The center of the indoor unit body 110 in the horizontal direction corresponds to the place adjacent to the left end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the right side. When the air cleaner 200 is held at the left end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the left side, it is preferable that the power supply unit 400 be arranged adjacent to the left end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the left side. The left end of the indoor unit body 110 corresponds to the place adjacent to the left end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the left side. When the air cleaner 200 is held at the right end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the right side, it is preferable that the power supply unit 400 be arranged adjacent to the right end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the right side. The right end of the indoor unit body 110 corresponds to the place adjacent to the right end of the filter cleaning device 300 on the right side.     [0112]    As described above, the insertion port 311 is provided in the front surface of the device body 310, and both the air cleaner 200 and the dust box 320 are inserted into the insertion port 311. The supporting part 500 is arranged in a range from the right end of the insertion port 311 to a position deep in the indoor unit body 110 in the depth direction. Specifically, the position deep in the depth direction in the indoor unit body 110 is a position in front of the lower heat exchanger 132. That is, in the present embodiment, the supporting part 500 extends from the front surface of the device body 310 toward the heat exchanger 132 and does not have contact with the heat exchanger 132. Therefore, the supporting part 500 does not damage the heat exchanger 132. Also, the supporting part 500 hardly prevents the flow of the air. In addition, a metal part, which is projected from the supporting part 500, such as the terminal to be described is hardly cooled. A metal part such as the terminal of the air cleaner 200 having contact with the terminal is hardly cooled. Also, the dew condensation water of the heat exchangers 131 and 132 does not flow into the supporting part 500. Therefore, the dew condensation hardly occurs in the supporting part 500 and the air cleaner 200. The supporting part 500 may be arranged in a range from the left end of the insertion port 311 to a position deep in the indoor unit body 110 in the depth direction. In this case, it is preferable that the position of the power supply unit 400 be changed according to the position of the supporting part 500. That is, it is preferable that at least a part of the power supply unit 400 be arranged just below the supporting part 500.     [0113]    The supporting part 500 includes an auxiliary receiving part 501 next to the main receiving part 315. The auxiliary receiving part 501 supports the dust box 320 together with the main receiving part 315.     [0114]    The upper surfaces of the main receiving part 315 and the auxiliary receiving part 501 form a wall surface of the lower side of the insertion port 311. The dust box 320 is placed on the wall surface, that is, the upper surfaces of the main receiving part 315 and the auxiliary receiving part 501 so that the dust box 320 is supported. A ridge line of the upper surface of the main receiving part 315 viewed from the side is the same in shape as that of the upper surface of the auxiliary receiving part 501.     [0115]    In the present embodiment, the supporting part 500 is manufactured as a component different from the components other than the main receiving part 315 and the device body 310. However, the supporting part 500 may be integrally molded with the main receiving part 315 and may be integrally molded with the other components of the device body 310.     [0116]    Fig. 11 is a diagram of the power supply unit 400 and the supporting part 500 which have been removed from the device body 310 of the filter cleaning device 300 viewed obliquely from above and front side. Fig. 12 is a diagram of a cross section where the power supply unit 400 is separated from the supporting part 500 and both of them are cut along a B-B line in Fig. 11 . Fig. 13 is a diagram of the disassembled power supply unit 400 and supporting part 500 viewed obliquely from above and front side. Fig. 14 is a diagram of the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 immediately before being electrically connected to each other, a third terminal 411 to be described, a fourth terminal 412 to be described, and a peripheral part. In Fig. 14 , for convenience of the description, the frame part 230 of the air cleaner 200 is removed so that each terminal can be seen.     [0117]    The supporting part 500 has an upper surface 510. The upper surface 510 is a surface on which the air cleaner 200 is placed when the air cleaner 200 is housed in the indoor unit body 110. Two holes of a third hole 511 and a fourth hole 512 are provided in the upper surface 510.     [0118]    The power supply unit 400 includes a fixing frame 401, a converter 403, an insulating frame 404, and a metal cover 405. The third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 are attached to the power supply unit 400 via a pair of electrical wires 402.     [0119]    The fixing frame 401 fixes the power supply unit 400 to the device body 310 of the filter cleaning device 300. A space to house the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 is formed above the fixing frame 401, and the supporting part 500 is fitted there so as to cover the space.     [0120]    The electrical wires 402 electrically connect the converter 403 to the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412.     [0121]    The converter 403 is attached to the fixing frame 401. The converter 403 converts power supplied from the outside of the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner into desired DC power via an electrical wire which is not shown. In the present embodiment, the converter 403 converts an AC voltage applied from a commercial power supply into a DC voltage and applies the obtained DC voltage to the first electrode 221 and the second electrode 222 of the air cleaner 200 via the electrical wires 402, the third terminal 411, and the fourth terminal 412.     [0122]    The insulating frame 404 covers the converter 403.     [0123]    The metal cover 405 covers the insulating frame 404.     [0124]    The third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 are respectively projected from the third hole 511 and the fourth hole 512. When the air cleaner 200 is placed on the upper surface 510 of the supporting part 500, the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 respectively have contact with the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 of the air cleaner 200. The power supply unit 400 applies the different voltages to the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 respectively via the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412. In the present embodiment, a voltage of 6000 volts is applied to the first terminal 227 via the third terminal 411, and a voltage of zero volts is applied to the second terminal 228 via the fourth terminal 412.     [0125]    The shapes, sizes, directions, and positions of the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 can be appropriately changed. However, the shape, size, direction, and position employed in the present embodiment are described below.     [0126]    It is preferable that a part projected from a hole of the fourth terminal 412 be arranged in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110 with an interval with a part projected from a hole of the third terminal 411. In the present embodiment, the part projected from the fourth hole 512 of the fourth terminal 412 is arranged in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110 with an interval with the part projected from the third hole 511 of the third terminal 411. Therefore, when the air cleaner 200 is attached to the indoor unit body 110, the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 have easily contact with the respective third terminal 411 and fourth terminal 412.     [0127]    Similarly, it is preferable that the fourth hole 512 and the third hole 511 be arranged in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110 with an interval from each other.     [0128]    As described above, in the present embodiment, the second end 256 of the second terminal 228 is arranged in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110 with an interval with the first end 255 of the first terminal 227. The first end 255 has a flat plate shape and includes a plate face 271. The first end 255 is arranged to have the thickness in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110. The second end 256 has a flat plate shape and includes a plate face 272. The second end 256 is arranged to have the thickness in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110. Since the thickness direction of the second end 256 is the same as that of the first end 255, as illustrated in Fig. 5 , the plate face 272 of the second end 256 is parallel to the plate face 271 of the first end 255. The directions in which the plate face 271 of the first end 255 and the plate face 272 of the second end 256 extend are respectively the front-back direction and the vertical direction of the indoor unit body 110. The third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 respectively have contact with the plate face 271 of the first end 255 and the plate face 272 of the second end 256. The directions in which the air cleaner 200 moves in a process to be placed on the supporting part 500 are the front-back direction and the vertical direction of the indoor unit body 110 and are the same as the directions in which the plate faces 271 and 272 extend. Therefore, the air cleaner 200 can be moved while the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 respectively have contact with the plate faces 271 and 272. Therefore, the air cleaner 200 can be smoothly attached to the indoor unit body 110.     [0129]    In the present embodiment, the length of the interval between the first end 255 and the second end 256 is adjusted to be the same as that of the interval between the part projected from the third hole 511 of the third terminal 411 and the part projected from the fourth hole 512 of the fourth terminal 412.     [0130]    It is preferable that the part projected from the hole of the fourth terminal 412 be positioned at the same position as the part projected from the hole of the third terminal 411 in the front-back direction of the indoor unit body 110. In the present embodiment, the part projected from the fourth hole 512 of the fourth terminal 412 is positioned at the same position as the part projected from the third hole 511 of the third terminal 411 in the front-back direction of the indoor unit body 110. Therefore, when the air cleaner 200 is attached to the indoor unit body 110, the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 have easily contact with the respective third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412.     [0131]    Similarly, the fourth hole 512 is provided at the same position as the third hole 511 in the front-back direction of the indoor unit body 110.     [0132]    In the present embodiment, the plate face 272 of the second end 256 is extended to the same position as that of the plate face 271 of the first end 255 in the front-back direction of the indoor unit body 110. Therefore, the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 have easily and concurrently contact with the plate face 271 of the first end 255 and the plate face 272 of the second end 256.     [0133]    It is preferable that the first terminal 227 be positioned at one end of the air cleaner 200 in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110. It is preferable that the second terminal 228 be positioned at the same end as the first terminal 227 of the air cleaner 200 in the horizontal direction of the indoor unit body 110. In the present embodiment, both the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 are positioned at the right end of the air cleaner 200. Therefore, the interval between the first end 255 and the second end 256 can be narrowed. The interval between the part projected from the third hole 511 of the third terminal 411 and the part projected from the fourth hole 512 of the fourth terminal 412 can be also narrowed. Therefore, the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 have easily and concurrently contact with the plate face 271 of the first end 255 and the plate face 272 of the second end 256.     [0134]    It is preferable that at least one of the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 be obliquely projected from the hole of the upper surface 510 to the upper surface 510. In the present embodiment, the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 are obliquely projected from the respective third hole 511 and fourth hole 512 to the upper surface 510. Specifically, the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 are inclined so as to be gradually projected forward from the lower end to the upper end. Accordingly, when the air cleaner 200 is inserted into the indoor unit body 110, the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 have easily and respectively contact with the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412. Especially, in the present embodiment, the first end 255 of the first terminal 227, the second end 256 of the second terminal 228, the third terminal 411, and the fourth terminal 412 have the flat plate shapes. Therefore, when the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 are inclined, the terminals do not have contact with each other at the point and have contact with each other along the line. In consideration of the thickness of each terminal, the terminals are not brought into line contact with each other and are brought into the surface contact with each other. Therefore, an effect that the air cleaner 200 can be smoothly inserted can be obtained.     [0135]    On the upper surface 510 of the supporting part 500, two walls, i.e., a first wall 513 and a second wall 514, are provided. The first wall 513 and the second wall 514 are respectively erected from the edge of the third hole 511 and the edge of the fourth hole 512. Specifically, the first wall 513 and the second wall 514 are respectively erected from the right edge of the third hole 511 and the right edge of the fourth hole 512.     [0136]    When the first terminal 227 is inserted between the third terminal 411 and the first wall 513, the upper end of the third terminal 411 is elastically deformed in the direction to be separated from the first wall 513. The first terminal 227 is sandwiched between the third terminal 411 and the first wall 513 so as to have contact with the third terminal 411. Accordingly, the first electrode 221 of the air cleaner 200 is electrically connected to the power supply unit 400. Similarly, when the second terminal 228 is inserted between the fourth terminal 412 and the second wall 514, the upper end of the fourth terminal 412 is elastically deformed in the direction to be separated from the second wall 514. The second terminal 228 is sandwiched between the fourth terminal 412 and the second wall 514 so as to have contact with the fourth terminal 412. Accordingly, the second electrode 222 of the air cleaner 200 is electrically connected to the power supply unit 400.     [0137]    At least one of the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 is gradually projected from the hole of the upper surface 510 to the wall, is bent in the middle, and is extended to the tip end as gradually separating from the wall. In the present embodiment, the third terminal 411 is projected as gradually moving from the third hole 511 to the first wall 513, is bent along the line C-C in Fig. 12 , and is extended to the tip end as gradually separating from the first wall 513. When the first terminal 227 is inserted between the third terminal 411 and the first wall 513, the bent part of the third terminal 411 is pressed by the first terminal 227 so that the upper end of the third terminal 411 is elastically deformed. The fourth terminal 412 has the same shape as the third terminal 411. The surface of the first terminal 227 for pressing against the bent part of the third terminal 411 is the plate face 271 of the first end 255. The surface of the second terminal 228 for pressing against the bent part of the fourth terminal 412 is the plate face 272 of the second end 256.     [0138]    On the upper surface 510 of the supporting part 500, two walls, i.e., a third wall 515 and a fourth wall 516, are provided. The third wall 515 and the fourth wall 516 are respectively erected from the edge opposite from that of the first wall 513 of the third hole 511 and the edge opposite from that of the second wall 514 of the fourth hole 512. Specifically, the third wall 515 and the fourth wall 516 are respectively erected from the left edge of the third hole 511 and the left edge of the fourth hole 512. A hollow part is provided in the third wall 515. The hollow part stores the upper end of the third terminal 411 when the upper end of the third terminal 411 is pressed by the first terminal 227 and is elastically deformed. Similarly, a hollow part is provided in the fourth wall 516. The hollow part stores the upper end of the fourth terminal 412 when the upper end of the fourth terminal 412 is pressed by the second terminal 228 and is elastically deformed.     [0139]    In addition, a slit 520 is provided in the supporting part 500. The slit 520 passes through between the third hole 511 and the fourth hole 512 in the vertical direction of the indoor unit body 110. Therefore, even when the water is dropped to the upper surface 510, the water is not accumulated.     [0140]    In the present embodiment, regarding the holes in the upper surface 510, the third hole 511 where the third terminal 411 is projected and the fourth hole 512 where the fourth terminal 412 is projected are individually provided. However, a single hole where both the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 are projected may be provided.     [0141]    Also, in the present embodiment, regarding the walls of the upper surface 510, the first wall 513 erected from the edge of the third hole 511 and the second wall 514 erected from the edge of the fourth hole 512 are individually provided. However, a single wall which is erected along the whole region from the edge of the third hole 511 to the edge of the fourth hole 512 or erected from the edge of the single hole may be provided.     [0142]    As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the first restriction unit 277 and the second restriction unit 278 are provided on the lower frame 232 of the air cleaner 200. When the air cleaner 200 is placed on the upper surface 510 of the supporting part 500 or when the air cleaner 200 is moved in the depth direction of the indoor unit body 110, the first restriction unit 277 has contact with the third wall 515. Accordingly, a range in which the air cleaner 200 can be moved in the depth direction of the indoor unit body 110 is restricted, and the contact between the air cleaner 200 and the heat exchangers 131 and 132 is prevented. Similarly, when the air cleaner 200 is placed on the upper surface 510 of the supporting part 500 or when the air cleaner 200 is moved in the depth direction of the indoor unit body 110, the second restriction unit 278 has contact with the second wall 514 and the fourth wall 516. Accordingly, a range in which the air cleaner 200 can be moved in the depth direction of the indoor unit body 110 is restricted, and the contact between the air cleaner 200 and the heat exchangers 131 and 132 is prevented.     [0143]    As illustrated in Figs. 10 and 15 , the filter cleaning device 300 includes a filter conveying guide 312, a filter housing guide 313, a filter conveying cover 331, and a front filter guide 332.     [0144]    The filter conveying guide 312 and the filter housing guide 313 form the device body 310. The filter housing guide 313 and the filter conveying cover 331 are arranged in the filter conveying guide 312. The front filter guide 332 is arranged in the filter conveying guide 312. The dust box 320 is also provided in the filter conveying guide 312.     [0145]    The filter conveying guide 312 includes a pair of conveying guide side plates opposed to each other, conveying guide vertical bars extended from the conveying guide side plates on the same plane, conveying guide horizontal bars for connecting the conveying guide side plates to each other and the conveying guide vertical bars to each other, and a conveying guide reinforcing bar for connecting the parts of the conveying guide horizontal bars to each other.     [0146]    A filter driving shaft of which both ends are rotatably supported is provided in a pair of the conveying guide side plates of the filter conveying guide 312 opposed to each other. A driving motor for rotatably driving the filter driving shaft is provided on the conveying guide side plate where the filter driving shaft is not provided. A conveyance gear 333 engaged with a filter driven rack formed in the filter 140 is placed on the filter driving shaft.     [0147]    On the opposed surface of the conveying guide vertical bar of the filter conveying guide 312, a conveying guide vertical flange to form a conveying guide groove to which the side edge of the filter 140 can enter is provided.     [0148]    The filter conveying cover 331 is a frame body arranged in the air trunk. The filter conveying cover 331 includes a pair of conveying cover vertical girders, conveying cover horizontal girders for connecting the conveying cover vertical girders to each other, and a conveying cover reinforcing girder for connecting the conveying cover horizontal girders to each other.     [0149]    On the opposed surface of the conveying cover vertical girder of the filter conveying cover 331, a conveying cover vertical flange to form the conveying guide groove to which the side edge of the filter 140 can enter is provided.     [0150]    The conveying cover vertical girder of the filter conveying cover 331 is joined to the conveying guide vertical bar of the filter conveying guide 312. Accurately, the conveying cover vertical girder on the left side is joined to the conveying guide vertical bar of the left side of the filter conveying guide 312 on the left side. The conveying cover vertical girder on the right side is joined to the conveying guide vertical bar on the right side of the filter conveying guide 312 on the right side. At this time, the conveying cover vertical flanges are opposed to each other with a predetermined interval, and the conveying guide groove to which the side edge of the filter 140 can enter is formed in the interval. The interval to which the filter 140 can enter is formed between the conveying cover reinforcing girder and the conveying guide reinforcing bar. Therefore, the conveying cover reinforcing girder and the conveying guide reinforcing bar form a guide unit corresponding to the conveying guide groove.     [0151]    The filter housing guide 313 includes a pair of housing guide side plates opposed to each other, housing guide notches which are formed in a part of the housing guide side plates and to which a filter driving shaft enters, housing guide horizontal bars for connecting the housing guide side plates to each other, and housing guide reinforcing bars for connecting parts of the housing guide horizontal bars to each other.     [0152]    On the opposed surface of the housing guide side plate of the filter housing guide 313, a housing guide groove to which the side edge of the filter 140 can enter is formed. The housing guide groove has a substantially spiral shape and includes a linear part of which one end is close to the housing guide notch and a substantially arc-shaped part of one and half winding continuously connected to the linear part.     [0153]    The filter 140 includes a rectangular filter ventilation body and the filter frame body. The filter ventilation body has a net-like shape. On the rear surface of the pair of filter vertical bars for forming the outline of the filter 140, that is, the surface on which the filter ventilation body is not provided, the filter driven rack which is an uneven pattern is formed at equal intervals in the longitudinal direction, that is, the vertical direction. The uneven pattern is not limited to an accurate tooth shape.     [0154]    An operation for moving the filter 140 is described below.     [0155]    The filter conveying guide 312 is arranged along the suction port 111 of the upper surface in a part closer to the upper surface of the front side of the indoor unit body 110. The filter housing guide 313 is provided on the conveying guide side plate of the filter conveying guide 312, and the housing guide notch of the filter housing guide 313 is positioned on the front side of the filter housing guide 313. The housing guide groove is positioned on the rear side, that is, the position on the side of the heat exchanger 131. In addition, the filter conveying cover 331 is placed on the conveying guide vertical bar of the filter conveying guide 312.     [0156]    Therefore, almost all the range of the filter 140 is rewound and expanded in a state where the side edge of the filter 140 enters the conveying guide groove which is a gap between the conveying guide vertical flange of the filter conveying guide 312 and the conveying cover vertical flange of the filter conveying cover 331. At this time, a front tip end which is one end of the filter 140 has a substantially arc shape with a small curvature radius when viewed from the side in a state where the front tip end is sandwiched between the upper surface of the dust box 320 and the conveyance gear 333.     [0157]    When the conveyance gear 333 is rotated in a positive direction, both side edges of the filter 140 are fed out toward the housing guide groove. The front tip end of the filter 140 is guided by the linear part of the housing guide groove and is moved in a substantially linear form first. When reaching the substantially arc-shaped part of the housing guide groove, the front tip end is moved in a spiral shape. When the rear end which is another end of the filter 140 moves closer to the conveyance gear 333, most part of the filter 140 is wound in a substantially spiral shape of about one and half winding. During the movement, regarding the filter ventilation body of the filter 140, a dust removing brush of the dust box 320 has contact with the surface on the windward side of the air trunk, and the dusts are removed.     [0158]    On the other hand, when the conveyance gear 333 is rotated in a negative direction, the filter 140 is rewound, and both side edges of the filter 140 are fed out to the conveying guide groove. When the filter 140 covers the entire air trunk, the rotation of the conveyance gear 333 is stopped. At this time, a part of the filter driven rack of the filter 140 is engaged with the conveyance gear 333.     [0159]    As described above, the device body 310 houses the filter 140 for capturing the dust in the air in a movable form. However, the filter 140 not only moves in the filter cleaning device 300 but also can be removed to the outside of the filter cleaning device 300.     [0160]    As illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10 , the front filter guide 332 is openably/closably attached to the front surface of the device body 310.     [0161]    An opening part to take out the filter 140 is formed on the front surface of the filter conveying guide 312. The front filter guide 332 covers the opening part and guides the movement of the filter 140 in a closed state.     [0162]    A rotation shaft of the front filter guide 332 to open/close the front filter guide 332 is formed at the position below the opening part of the filter conveying guide 312. On the other hand, a fixing part 314 to fix the end apart from the rotation center of the front filter guide 332 in the closed state of the front filter guide 332 is provided at the position above the opening part of the filter conveying cover 331. Therefore, in the closed state of the front filter guide 332, not only the end closer to the rotation center of the front filter guide 332 but also the end apart from the rotation center of the front filter guide 332 is fixed to the device body 310. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, the front filter guide 332 can be surely fixed.     [0163]    The front filter guide 332 is hung down by its self-weight in an opened state. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, it is not necessary for the user of the air conditioner to support the front filter guide 332 by hand in order to maintain the opened state of the front filter guide 332, and it is not necessary to fix the front filter guide 332 with some fixing mechanisms.     [0164]    The front filter guide 332 is a movable member positioned between the front panel 150 attached to the indoor unit body 110 and the filter 140. The front filter guide 332 includes a guide unit having contact with the filter 140 at the time of the movement, and the guide unit is a conveyance path of the filter 140. The front filter guide 332 can be opened so that the user of the air conditioner can easily take out the filter 140.     [0165]    The front filter guide 332 and the dust box 320 are not integrated and separately formed. The front filter guide 332 after being rotated and moved is arranged in a space obtained by removing the dust box 320, that is, a space where the dust box 320 has been originally placed. By separately providing the front filter guide 332 above the dust box 320, both of them can be efficiently housed. Also, when the front filter guide 332 is rotated, a rotation locus can be secured without interfering with other member.     [0166]    In this way, in the present embodiment, the dust box 320 where the dusts captured by the filter 140 are accumulated is removably attached to the front surface of the filter conveying guide 312 separately from the front filter guide 332. Therefore, it is preferable that the user of the air conditioner remove only the dust box 320 when the dusts accumulated in the dust box 320 are thrown away. It is not necessary to remove the front filter guide 332. It is preferable that the front filter guide 332 be not easily removed.     [0167]    In the present embodiment, the user can easily take out the filter 140 by using both hands without a special fixing mechanism by hanging down the front filter guide 332 and exposing the filter 140.     [0168]    Fig. 16 is a diagram of the dust box 320 viewed obliquely from above and front side. Fig. 17 is a diagram of the dust box 320 viewed obliquely from below and front side. Fig. 18 is a diagram of the dust box 320 viewed obliquely from above and rear side. Figs. 19 to 22 are diagrams of different cross sections of the dust box 320. Fig. 23 is a diagram of the lower part of the dust box 320 cut for description.     [0169]    The dust box 320 includes wall plates 321 assembled in a box-like shape, a dust removing shaft 322 of which both ends are supported by both wall plates 321 in a freely swingable manner, and a stopper member 323 attached to the wall plate 321 on the front side.     [0170]    The wall plates 321 forms a dust collecting chamber 324 which is a space for accumulating the dusts. A dust removing brush which is not shown is attached to the dust removing shaft 322. When being viewed from the upper side, the center of the wall plate 321 on the upper side is opened to the width direction. When being viewed from the side, at the substantially center of the wall plate 321, a brush hole 341 is formed. The tip end of the dust removing brush passes through the brush hole 341. In a state where the dust box 320 is attached to the filter conveying guide 312, the dust removing brush swings when the dust removing shaft 322 swings. Therefore, in a state where the filter 140 has contact with the dust removing brush, the dust removing brush swings so that the dust adhered to the filter 140 is scraped off. The dust which has been scraped off is fallen down to the dust collecting chamber 324 and is accumulated. At this time, since the filter 140 is moved, the dusts on the wide range of the filter 140 can be removed.     [0171]    The lower part of the wall plate 321 is inclined, and the wall plate 321 on the rear side forms an inclined face part 342. The inclined face part 342 and the wall plate 321 on the lower side form a lid 343 of the dust collecting chamber 324.     [0172]    In a state where the dust box 320 is attached to the filter conveying guide 312, the dust box 320 is fixed by a spring force of the stopper member 323 so as not to get out. The user of the air conditioner can remove the dust box 320 by sliding the stopper member 323. The user of the air conditioner can throw away the dusts accumulated in the dust collecting chamber 324 by opening the lid 343.     [0173]    In the present embodiment, in order to surely fix the front filter guide 332 and surely convey the filter 140, the front filter guide 332 and the dust box 320 are separately formed, and fixing parts 344 and 345 to press and fix the front filter guide 332 by contacting the front filter guide 332 are provided in the dust box 320.     [0174]    When the dust box 320 is attached, in a state where the front filter guide 332 is fixed to the device body 310, the dust box 320 is attached after that. In order to improve a space efficiency, the rotation locus of the front filter guide 332 uses a space where the dust box 320 is attached. Therefore, the front filter guide 332 can rotate and move when the dust box 320 is removed. Also, the dust box 320 can be attached when the front filter guide 332 is returned to the original attached position from the moved state. Therefore, the front filter guide 332 is in the closed state and the dust box 320 is attached after that so that the fixing parts 344 and 345 can press and fix the front filter guide 332.     [0175]    The front filter guide 332 is pressed by the fixing part 344 included in the dust box 320 from the front side to the rear side. The fixing part 344 is provided on the rear side of the dust box 320 and the side opposed to the front filter guide 332. A projecting part 346 is included in the upper part of the dust box 320. The fixing part 344 may be the rear surface of the projecting part 346. However, in the present embodiment, the fixing part 344 is a rib provided on the rear surface of the projecting part 346 and presses and fixes the front filter guide 332 by contacting the front filter guide 332. Therefore, the fixing part 344 has contact with the front filter guide 332 from the front side and a force is applied to the rear side by attaching the dust box 320, and then the front filter guide 332 can be fixed.     [0176]    By fixing the front filter guide 332 with the fixing part 344 included in the projecting part 346 projected upward the dust box 320, the front filter guide 332 is fixed in the width direction. Therefore, a case does not occur where both sides of the front filter guide 332 are fixed and the center part is not firmly fixed and the center part is slightly moved in the front-back direction. Therefore, a malfunction does not occur in which the filter 140 is not firmly engaged with the conveyance gear 333 and the filter 140 is removed from the conveyance gear 333.     [0177]    Both sides of the dust box 320 are fixed to the filter conveying guide 312. In this state, an opposed part 347 which is a top face of the dust box 320 other than the projecting part 346 enters under the front filter guide 332 and is opposed to the front filter guide 332. An angle between the opposed part 347 and the projecting part 346 is about 90. That is, the opposed part 347 and the projecting part 346 are formed in an L-shape in a side view. The opposed part 347 has contact with the front filter guide 332 from the lower side, and the projecting part 346 has contact with the front filter guide 332 from the front side.     [0178]    With this structure, the front filter guide 332 and the dust box 320 can be arranged in a small sizes. The opposed part 347 of the dust box 320 enters under the front filter guide 332 so as to reduce the size in the vertical direction. The opposed part 347 and the projecting part 346 of the dust box 320 form an angle of about 90 and the projecting part 346 presses the front filter guide 332 from the front side to the rear side so that the size in the front-back direction can be reduced.     [0179]    The fixing part 344 can press and fix the front filter guide 332 so that the front filter guide 332 is not moved in the front-back direction. Therefore, the filter cleaning device 300 which surely and inexpensively conveys the filter 140 without increasing the number of components can be obtained. In the above filter cleaning device 300, the filter 140 is not removed from the conveyance gear 333, and it is not necessary to provide a new pressing member other than the projecting part 346 which is integrally molded with the dust box 320.     [0180]    The front filter guide 332 is pressed by the fixing part 345 included in the dust box 320 from the lower side to the upper side. The fixing part 345 is arranged on the side opposed to the front filter guide 332 and on the upper surface side of the dust box 320. The fixing part 345 may be the surface of the opposed part 347 of the dust box 320. However, in the present embodiment, the fixing part 345 is a rib provided on the surface of the opposed part 347 and presses and fixes the front filter guide 332 by contacting the front filter guide 332. Therefore, the fixing part 345 has contact with the front filter guide 332 from the lower side and a force is applied to the upper side by attaching the dust box 320, and accordingly, the front filter guide 332 can be fixed.     [0181]    By fixing the front filter guide 332 with the fixing part 345 included in the opposed part 347 on the top face of the dust box 320, the front filter guide 332 is fixed in the width direction. Therefore, a case does not occur where both sides of the front filter guide 332 are fixed and the center part is not firmly fixed and the center part is slightly moved in the front-back direction. Therefore, a malfunction does not occur in which the filter 140 is not firmly engaged with the conveyance gear 333 and the filter 140 is removed from the conveyance gear 333.     [0182]    The fixing part 345 can press and fix the front filter guide 332 so that the front filter guide 332 is not moved in the front-back direction. Therefore, the filter cleaning device 300 which surely and inexpensively conveys the filter 140 without increasing the number of components can be obtained. In the above filter cleaning device 300, the filter 140 is not removed from the conveyance gear 333, and it is not necessary to provide a new pressing member.     [0183]    When one of the fixing parts 344 and 345 is included, the effect described above can be obtained. However, to obtain a larger effect, it is preferable to include both the fixing parts 344 and 345.     [0184]    As another unit, which is not shown, to press the front filter guide 332 from the front side, a push rib may be formed which is projected from a part which is on the rear surface of the front panel 150 attached to the indoor unit body 110 and faces the front filter guide 332. The push rib may press the front filter guide 332 from the front side to the rear side. Also, in this case, the filter cleaning device 300 which can surely and inexpensively convey the filter 140 without providing a new pressing member and without increasing the number of components can be obtained.     [0185]    A lifting rib 348 to lift the dust box 320 is projected from a bottom surface part of the dust box 320. By providing the lifting rib 348, the inclination of the dust box 320 in the front-back direction caused by variation of the size can be prevented. That is, when the dust box 320 is inclined forward, it is hard to apply the force to the rear side by the fixing part 344. Therefore, this situation can be prevented by providing the lifting rib 348. Also, the dust box 320 can be easily attached by contacting the lifting rib 348 with the frame of the filter conveying guide 312 and not contacting the entire lower surface of the dust box 320 with it.     [0186]    It is preferable that the lifting rib 348 have a spherical shape. By forming the lifting rib 348 in the spherical shape, the lifting rib 348 is hardly hooked to the frame of the filter conveying guide 312 when the dust box 320 is attached. Therefore, the dust box 320 can be smoothly attached. Also, it is preferable that at least two or more lifting ribs 348 be provided on both sides of the dust box 320 in the width direction. In this way, the dust box 320 is not inclined in the vertical direction, and the dust box 320 is not inclined in the front-back direction across the entire dust box 320 in the width direction. Therefore, the fixing part 344 can surely press and fix the front filter guide 332 from the front side to the rear side.     [0187]    In this way, in the present embodiment, regarding the dust box 320, the front filter guide 332 is fixed at the attachment position of the front filter guide 332 in the device body 310 by pressing the front filter guide 332. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, the front filter guide 332 can be surely fixed.     [0188]    In the dust box 320, the front filter guide 332 is fixed at the attachment position by pressing the front filter guide 332 at least to the rear side. Specifically, on the upper surface of the dust box 320, the opposed part 347 opposed to the front filter guide 332, the projecting part 346 projected from the position on the front side of the opposed part 347 in a plate-shape are provided. The dust box 320 presses the front filter guide 332 to the rear side by using one of both surfaces of the projecting part 346 in the thickness direction.     [0189]    The dust box 320 presses the front filter guide 332 at least upward and fixes the front filter guide 332 at the attachment position. Specifically, the dust box 320 presses the front filter guide 332 upward by using the surface of the opposed part 347.     [0190]    The lifting rib 348 for pressing the filter conveying guide 312 is provided on the lower surface of the dust box 320. It is preferable that the lifting rib 348 have a hemispherical shape. Also, it is preferable that the plurality of lifting ribs 348 be arranged along the horizontal direction of the dust box 320.     [0191]    In the present embodiment, the dust box 320 has a box-like shape having the cross section which substantially has a shape of a trapezoid. The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid are parallel to each other, and the top side is longer than the bottom side. The dust box 320 is provided in a space between the front panel 150 and the heat exchangers 131 and 132 in the front-back direction. The front surface of the dust box 320 is substantially flat and is exposed to the user of the air conditioner when the front panel 150 is opened. The lower surface of the dust box 320 is substantially flat and is arranged on the frame of the filter conveying guide 312. The rear surface of the dust box 320 is obliquely inclined backward from the lower side to the upper side. The rear surface of the dust box 320 is opposed to the heat exchangers 131 and 132 provided on the rear side and is exposed.     [0192]    The oblique inclination to the rear side of the rear surface of the dust box 320 from the lower side to the upper side generates a space on the lower and rear side. A part of the air cleaner 200 can be housed in the space. Therefore, the depth length of the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner can be reduced.     [0193]    In the present embodiment, a part of the filter conveying guide 312 forms the supporting part 500. The supporting part 500 removably holds the air cleaner 200 for cleaning the air which has passed through the filter 140.     [0194]    The air cleaner 200 is provided on the rear side of the dust box 320 placed on the rear side of the front panel 150 and on the front side the heat exchangers 131 and 132. The user of the air conditioner can take out the air cleaner 200 and performs maintenance such as cleaning. The user of the air conditioner can easily take out the air cleaner 200 by grabbing the handle 233 of the air cleaner 200 by one's hands.     [0195]    The air cleaner 200 is arranged below the filter housing guide 313 and between the dust box 320 and the heat exchangers 131 and 132. In this way, wind from the above can easily pass through the air cleaner 200, and the depth length and the height length of the indoor unit 100 of the air conditioner can be reduced by efficiently using a dead space below the filter housing guide 313 and between the dust box 320 and the heat exchangers 131 and 132.     [0196]    As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 6 , a part of the handle 233 of the air cleaner 200 is obliquely inclined downward from the rear side to the front side. It is preferable that both the inclined part and the inclined face part 342 of the dust box 320 be inclined at substantially equal angles. The substantially equal angles mean angles having a difference equal to or less than 30.     [0197]    When the user of the air conditioner places the air cleaner 200 after the maintenance, there is a possibility that the user of the air conditioner inserts the air cleaner 200 to the middle and the user only places the air cleaner 200. In this case, disconnection of electrical contact of the air cleaner 200 causes a loose connection or discharge in the air. This lowers the quality such as generation of a noise.     [0198]    In the present embodiment, even when the air cleaner 200 is not correctly attached, the rear surface including the inclined face part 342 of the dust box 320 has contact with the handle 233 of the air cleaner 200. In this way, an operation of the user of the air conditioner for attaching the dust box 320 forcibly pushes the air cleaner 200 backward and downward while the rear surface of the dust box 320 has contact with the handle 233 regardless of the intention of the user of the air conditioner. Therefore, the air cleaner 200 is automatically attached to the supporting part 500 formed in the filter conveying guide 312.     [0199]    When the length of the inclined face part 342 is equal to or more than half of the length of the entire rear surface, an area of the rear surface of the dust box 320 having contact with the handle 233 of the air cleaner 200 is increased. While sliding the handle 233 of the air cleaner 200 downward or slipping the handle 233 of the air cleaner 200 downward, the handle 233 of the air cleaner 200 can be surely guided downward.     [0200]    The rear surface of the dust box 320 includes two or more surfaces including the inclined face part 342 and a part other than the inclined face part 342 extending in the vertical direction so that the dust removing brush can be easily provided in the dust collecting chamber 324. That is, when the rear surface of the dust box 320 is formed of two or more surfaces of the inclined face part 342, the volume of the dust collecting chamber 324 is larger than that in a case where the rear surface of the dust box 320 is formed of a single surface of the inclined face part 342.     [0201]    When the height of the inclined face part 342 of the rear surface of the dust box 320 is higher than that of a part other than the inclined face part 342 of the rear surface, an area having contact with an extending part 52 is increased. Therefore, while sliding the handle 233 of the air cleaner 200 downward or slipping the handle 233 of the air cleaner 200 downward, the handle 233 of the air cleaner 200 can be surely guided downward.     [0202]    In the present embodiment, the dust box 320 fixes the air cleaner 200 at the holding position of the air cleaner 200 in the filter conveying guide 312 by pressing the air cleaner 200. That is, the dust box 320 fixes the air cleaner 200 to the supporting part 500 by pressing the air cleaner 200. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, the air cleaner 200 is easily attached to the correct position in the filter cleaning device 300.     [0203]    At least a part of the rear surface of the dust box 320 is obliquely inclined downward, and the inclined face part 342 which is the inclined part presses the air cleaner 200. For example, the dust box 320 presses the handle 233 provided in the lower part on the front surface of the air cleaner 200 backward and downward by the inclined face part 342.     [0204]    When the surface area of the inclined face part 342 is larger, the dust box 320 can surely press the air cleaner 200 to the correct position by the inclined face part 342. Therefore, it is preferable that the length of the inclined face part 342 on the rear surface of the dust box 320 in the front-back direction be longer than the length of the other part on the rear surface in the front-back direction. Also, it is preferable that the length of the inclined face part 342 on the rear surface of the dust box 320 in the vertical direction be longer than that of the other part on the rear surface in the vertical direction.     [0205]    The entire rear surface of the dust box 320 may be the inclined face part 342. However, in this case, the volume of the dust collecting chamber 324 is reduced. Therefore, it is preferable that the dust box 320 have a part vertically extending from a part of the rear surface. That is, it is preferable that the part other than the inclined face part 342 on the rear surface of the dust box 320 be vertically extended.     [0206]    In the present embodiment, as described above, the inclined face part 342 is provided on the rear surface of the dust box 320. Therefore, when the dust box 320 is attached to the front side of the filter conveying guide 312 in a state where the air cleaner 200 is positioned in front of the holding position of the air cleaner 200 in the filter conveying guide 312, the air cleaner 200 is pushed into and is fixed to the correct holding position by the dust box 320.     *** Description of effect ***    [0207]    In the present embodiment, at least a part of one first plate-shaped electrode 223 from among the plurality of first plate-shaped electrodes 223 is fitted into the slit 237 of the frame part 230. According to this, the plurality of first plate-shaped electrodes 223 is positioned. Therefore, the intervals between the first plate-shaped electrodes 223 and the second plate-shaped electrodes 224 become more even.     [0208]    In the present embodiment, the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 are attached to the end of the plurality of first plate-shaped electrodes 223 and the plurality of second plate-shaped electrodes 224 arranged in the first direction D1 and at the position separated in the third direction D3 perpendicular to both the first direction D1 and the second direction D2 in which the first connection member 225 and the second connection member 226 are overlapped to each other. According to this, the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 can be arranged in a small space. Therefore, the air cleaner 200 can be miniaturized.     [0209]    In the present embodiment, a hole is provided in the upper surface 510 of the supporting part 500. The third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412 included in the power supply unit 400 are projected through the hole. When the air cleaner 200 is placed on the upper surface 510 of the supporting part 500, the first terminal 227 and the second terminal 228 included in the air cleaner 200 respectively have contact with the third terminal 411 and the fourth terminal 412. Accordingly, the attachment and the electrical connection of the air cleaner 200 can be concurrently performed. Therefore, the air cleaner 200 can be easily attached/removed.     [0210]    In the present embodiment, the center position of the air cleaner 200 in the height direction is a position lower than the connection part 134 between the upper heat exchanger 131 and the lower heat exchanger 132. Since the air cleaner 200 hardly prevents the air flow, the efficiency of the air conditioner is improved.     [0211]    In the present embodiment, the power supply unit 400 is housed in the lower part of the front surface of the indoor unit body 110. Since the power supply unit 400 is not positioned in the air trunk, the efficiency of the air conditioner is improved.     [0212]    In the present embodiment, the air cleaner 200 is supported by a part of the device body 310 of the filter cleaning device 300. Therefore, the air cleaner 200 can be provided apart from the heat exchangers 131 and 132.     [0213]    In the present embodiment, the air cleaner 200 is built in the air conditioner and used. Nevertheless, an air cleaner having the same structure may be built in a different appliance and used. The different appliance includes a cleaner, a hand drier, an air freshener, a humidifier, a dehumidifier, an exhaust fan, an elevator, a refrigerator, a car, and a train. These appliances each include a frame body for housing the air cleaner, and the air cleaner is mounted to each of the appliances by using the frame body, thereby effectively removing or inactivating bacteria, molds, and virus in the air. As a result, the air is cleaned, and the user of the appliance feels more comfortable.     [0214]    The embodiment of the present invention has been described above. Nevertheless, the embodiment may be partially performed. For example, from among ones described as ""units"" in the description of the embodiment, only one unit may be employed, or a combination of some units may be employed. The present invention is not limited to the embodiment and can be variously changed as necessary.

The dots of the dot pattern are printed with an ink that has a chacteristic that absorbs at least a predetermined wavelength light or the characteristic that absorbs the predetermined wavelength light and a visible light transmission characteristic, and the diffuse reflection layer is formed by arranging a directional reflection material so that the predetermined wavelength light that is irradiated by the irradiation means is diffusely reflected toward the dot pattern reading surface.","FIELD OF THE INVENTION    [0001]    The present invention relates to an information input assistance sheet for reading a printed dot pattern, in particular, relating to an information input assistance sheet for reading a dot pattern printed on a minute area.     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION    [0002]    Computers are recently increasingly mounting a touch panel function on a display device as a standard feature. In some computers, to add a touch panel function to a display device which is not equipped with a touch panel function, a film printed with a dot pattern that signifies coordinate information for enabling reading means to input coordinates may be attached to the front of or ahead of the display device (for example, refer to Patent Literature 1)     [0003]    The Applicant has been granted patent rights of an information input sheet that includes an infrared reflection layer having characteristics of reflecting infrared light and transmitting visible light and a dot pattern layer having dots formed of an infrared absorption material arranged thereon (for example, refer to Patent Literature 2).     [0004]    As for the reflection layer, a projection screen that contains 50% or more spiral axis structure area in a polarized light selective reflection layer is known. In the spiral axis structure area, the angle between the spiral axis of the spiral axis structure and the normal line of the substrate plane is made in the range of 0 to 45 degrees by varying containment of leveling agent in a coating liquid for forming a polarized light selective reflection layer, thereby injecting leveling agent inside the polarized light selective reflection layer, thus, influencing the configuration of the cholesteric liquid crystal structure domain at a molecular level (for example, refer to Patent Literature 3).     PRIOR ART LITERATURE    PATENT LITERATURE    [0005]    Patent Literature 1: Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2003-256137Patent Literature 2: The publication of Japanese Patent No. 4129841Patent Literature 3: Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2005-37735    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION    PROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE    [0006]    However, Patent Literature 1 discloses only the idea of the film, yet, does not describe means for realizing the film.     [0007]    Figs. 24A and 24B are diagrams illustrating a conventional grid sheet described in Patent Literature 2. As in Figs. 24A and 24B , for example, if IR-LEDs as optical reading devices are provided at two positions with a lens in-between and infrared light irradiated from the IR-LEDs is specularly reflected off the infrared reflection layer in a manner in which angles of the incident light and reflection light with respect to a normal line direction of the grid sheet become the same, the lens provided in the middle of the two IR-LEDs cannot receive the central portion of the reflection light of the infrared light irradiated from the IR-LEDs.     [0008]    While Figs. 24A and 24B illustrate an example of use of the scanner standing perpendicular to the grid sheet, the scanner is often used with inclination of 30 to 40 degrees out of perpendicular to the grid sheet. Figs. 25A and 25B are diagrams illustrating a conventional grid sheet when the scanner is used with inclination, which arises a problem where only part of reflection light of infrared light irradiated from the IR-LEDs can be received by specular reflection of the grid sheet.     [0009]    While Patent Literature 2 indicates that an infrared diffusion layer is provided between an infrared reflection layer and a dot pattern layer, it does not specifically describe the infrared reflection layer. In Patent Literature 2, the diameter of the opening of the optical reading device illustrated in Figs. 24A to 25B is about 4 mm, within which about 60 dots, each of the size of about 50 m, are printed with intervals of about 508 m. Thus, the optical reading device of the dot pattern is required to have the ability to identify infrared reflection light with high precision.     [0010]    Patent Literature 3 claims favorable diffusibility and visibility for a projection screen which contains 50 percent or more spiral axis structure area where angles between the spiral axes of the spiral axis structure area and the normal line of the substrate plane are in the range from 0 to 45 degrees. However, nanometer level visibility in a super minute area of micrometer level is not assured.     [0011]    Further, in Patent Literature 3, with 50 percent or more containment of spiral axis structure area where the angles between the normal line and the spiral axes are in the range of 0 to 45 degrees, reflection light, of which angle with the normal line of the substrate plane of the projection screen is in the range within 0 to 45 degrees, is collected. Thus, when a contact angle with the grid sheet with respect to the normal line of the projection screen is more than 45 degrees as shown in Fig. 25A , the light reception amount of reflection light decreases, which makes it hard to read the dot patterns.     [0012]    Thus, the objective of the present invention is to provide an information input assistance sheet having an infrared diffuse reflection layer that is formed of a material that makes it possible to read infrared reflection light reflected from an ultra minute area, regardless of the contact angle of the optical reading device with the ultra minute area, when the optical reading device reads a dot pattern by causing infrared light emitted from the light source of the optical reading device to be reflected off the information input assistance sheet printed with dots that absorb infrared light.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS    [0016]    The following will describe the first to twelfth embodiments relating to a directional reflection layer of the information input assistance sheet of the present invention with reference to Figs. 1A to 15 , then, describe the eleventh and twelfth embodiments relating to a dot pattern layer of the information input assistance sheet of the present invention with reference to Figs. 14 to 25B .     [0017]    The following will further describe the first to eighth embodiments relating to an infrared diffusion layer that diffusely reflects infrared light in the directional reflection layer of the information input assistance sheet of the present invention with reference to Figs. 1A to 11 , then, describe the eleventh and twelfth embodiments relating to an infrared recursive reflection layer that recursively reflects infrared light in the directional reflection layer of the information input assistance sheet of the present invention with reference to Figs. 14 and 15 .     (Structure of grid sheet)    [0018]    Fig. 1 A is a section view showing how the grid sheet of the present invention is read by a scanner. Fig. 1B is a diagram illustrating a captured image read by a lens. As shown in Fig. 1A , in order to read information relating to what is displayed on a display using infrared light IR irradiated by the scanner, the grid sheet 1 comprises, from the scanner side, a protecting transparent sheet (protection layer) 2, a dot pattern layer 4 (a dot pattern is printed on the back surface of the protection layer 2), on which are printed dots 3 that include a characteristic material that absorbs infrared light (represented by a sign ""IR"" in Fig. 1A and hereinafter also referred to as ""infrared light IR."" Indication of ""infrared light IRx"" is made to specify the wavelength of infrared light), an infrared diffusion layer 5, provided adjacent to the dot pattern layer 4, which selects infrared light by coated polymer molecules 9 and diffusely reflects the reflection light in the reflection angle  direction that is different from the incident angle  with respect to the normal line of the grid sheet 1, and an infrared reflection layer 6, provided adjacent to the infrared diffusion layer 5, which specularly reflects the reflection light of the infrared light in a reflection angle direction that is the same direction as the incident angle with respect to the normal line of the grid sheet 1 and transmits visible light. The infrared diffusion layer 5 may be an infrared diffuse reflection layer. The infrared reflection layer 6 is not necessary as long as the infrared diffusion layer 5 can sufficiently reflect infrared light.     [0019]    The protecting transparent sheet 2 is made of a material that transmits visible light and infrared light, such as vinyl, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and polypropylene. Since repetitive touch by the scanner on the dots 3 may ware and make it hard to read the dot pattern 7 constituted of the dots 3, the protecting transparent sheet 2 is provided to protect wearing and stain of the dots 3 so as to make the dot pattern 7 to be read correctly for a long time. The dots can be completely protected by printing the dot pattern on the opposite side of the reading surface.     [0020]    The dot pattern layer 4 has a dot pattern 7, in which dots 3 that contain a characteristic material, such as a carbon ink that absorbs infrared light, are printed in accordance with a rule indicating predetermined information.     [0021]    The infrared diffusion layer 5 has a support body 8 and polymer molecules 9 coated on the support body 8. The infrared light transmitted through the protecting transparent sheet 2 is diffusely reflected in a direction of a reflection angle  that is different from the incident angle  with respect to the normal line of the grid sheet 1 by the polymer molecules 9 coated on the infrared diffusion layer 5. To use the infrared diffusion layer 5 also as the infrared reflection layer 6, polymer molecules 9 that diffusely reflect infrared light are deposited on a transparent sheet for deposition that is made of a material that transmits visible light, such as vinyl, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and polypropylene. It should be noted that the support body 8 may not necessary depending on the forming method.     [0022]    The infrared reflection layer 6 is formed by depositing polymer molecules 9 that reflects infrared light on a transparent sheet for deposition that is made of a material that transmits visible light, such as vinyl, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and polypropylene. The infrared light transmitted through the infrared reflection layer 5 is specularly reflected in a direction of a reflection angle that is the same as the incident angle with respect to the normal line of the grid sheet 1 by the polymer molecules 9 deposited on the infrared reflection layer 6. The infrared reflection layer 6 transmits visible light and blocks infrared light from a display.     (Scanner structure)    [0023]    The scanner comprises two IR-LEDs that irradiate infrared light to the grid sheet 1 disposed on the display screen of a display, a lens provided in-between the two IR-LEDs for receiving reflection light of the infrared light, an IR filter that blocks predetermined wavelength elements of the reflection light received by the lens, a diffuser for evenly irradiating the infrared light to the grid sheet 1, and a C-MOS sensor as an imaging element. There may be only one IR-LED as long as sufficient infrared light is irradiated.     [0024]    The C-MOS sensor of the scanner images the reflection light of the infrared light irradiated to the grid sheet 1. Since the dot pattern 7 is printed with an ink that includes a characteristic material that absorbs infrared light, only the portion of the dots 3 where infrared light is absorbed and not reflected is imaged in black in the captured image by the C-MOS sensor.     [0025]    The infrared light irradiated from the IR-LED is diffusely reflected from the infrared diffusion layer 5 and the infrared light transmitted through the infrared reflection layer 5 is specularly reflected off the infrared reflection layer 6. The lens of the scanner can receive reflection light of the infrared light IR from the entire imaging area by diffuse reflection of the infrared diffusion layer 5 as shown in Fig. 1B . Since specular reflection of the infrared reflection layer 6 compensates brightness in the normal line direction of the grid sheet 1, a bright and clear dot pattern 7 is imaged, enabling accurate analysis of the dot codes. The infrared diffusion layer 5 can also function as an infrared reflection layer 6, as long as the infrared diffusion layer 5 sufficiently reflects infrared light and a bright and clear dot pattern 7 is imaged.     [0026]    It should be noted that, while having the protecting transparent sheet 2 is not essential, the infrared reflection layer 6 is not essential either, when the dot pattern layer 4 is provided adjacent to the protecting transparent sheet 2; the infrared diffusion layer 5 is provided adjacent to the dot pattern layer 4; and the infrared reflection layer 6 is provided adjacent to the infrared diffusion layer 5. If the brightness of the infrared reflection light IR is not sufficient, illuminance of the IR-LED may be increased to compensate the brightness.     [0027]    Fig. 2A is a section view showing how the grid sheet of the present invention is read by the scanner with inclination. Fig. 2B is a diagram showing a captured image read by the lens. In Fig. 2A , the infrared diffusion layer 5 is directly disposed on the display screen of the display without having the infrared reflection layer 6 in the grid sheet 1.     [0028]    As shown in Fig. 2B , since the infrared light irradiated from the IR-LED is diffusely reflected off the infrared diffusion layer 5, the lens of the scanner can receive the infrared reflection light from the entire imaging area regardless of the contact angle of the scanner with respect to the grid sheet 1. However, depending on the inclination angle of the scanner, the inclined side may become bright and the opposite side may become dark with a possibility of not receiving infrared reflection light.     <First embodiment>    (Cell of infrared diffusion layer)    [0029]    Fig. 3 is a projection view schematically showing a cell of an infrared diffusion layer of the grid sheet of the first to sixth embodiments of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 3 , the cell 10 of the infrared diffusion layer 5 is made of liquid crystal polymers having cholesteric regularity with a plurality of laminated layers, each of which has a molecular sequence, in which polymer molecules 9 are aligned in one direction, and the cell has a spiral structure where each layer is twisted a little from an adjacent layer.     [0030]    As long as the liquid crystal has cholesteric regularity, the liquid crystal may be chiral nematic liquid crystal or cholesteric liquid crystal, and the twist may be formed by adding chiral agent or the like to a liquid crystal material that has nematic regularity or smectic regularity.     [0031]    The cell 10 selectively reflects, with respect to the spiral axis SA of the spiral structure, only the incident light of the infrared light IR of a wavelength that is determined by the product of a spiral pitch P1 between the polymer molecules 9 and the average refractive index R1 of liquid crystal. Since the selected wavelength is infrared light, the liquid crystal becomes transparent.     [0032]    It should be noted that the shape of the cell 10 is not limited to a pillar shape, such as a column or a prism, as shown in Fig. 3 . The shape of the cell 10 may be a disk shape, a rugby-ball-shaped ellipsoid body, a bread roll shape, a combination of the bread roll shape and the rugby ball shape, or the like.     (Infrared diffusion layer)    [0033]    Fig. 4 is a section view schematically illustrating diffuse reflection of an infrared diffusion layer of the grid sheet of the first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 4 , in the infrared diffusion layer 5 of the grid sheet 1 of the first embodiment, the orientation angles of a plurality of cells 10 where polymer molecules 9 are laminated in the same direction so as to selectively reflect infrared light IR are irregularly changed and arranged with respect to the plane surface of the grid sheet 1. For example, the infrared diffusion layer 5 may be formed by adding a surface conditioner such as leveling agent that is used for improving leveling and flow of the surface of the liquid crustal polymers and adding heat and vibration.     [0034]    As each cell 10 with a different orientation angle with respect to the plane surface of the grid sheet 1 is arranged in the infrared diffusion layer 5, the infrared diffusion layer 5 includes many cells 10, of which spiral axis SA is not arranged perpendicular to the grid sheet 1, and the infrared light irradiated from the IR-LED is reflected in a reflection angle  direction that is different from the incident angle  with respect to the grid sheet 1 by the polymer molecules 9 of each cell 10. Since the orientations of the spiral axes SA of adjacent cells 10 in the infrared diffusion layer 5 irregularly vary, the reflection light of the infrared light is diffusely reflected.     [0035]    As the lens of the scanner can receive reflection light, from the entire imaging area, of the infrared light irradiated from the IR-LED by diffuse reflection of the infrared diffusion layer 5, any light-receiving-disabled area that cannot receive infrared reflection light as shown in Figs. 24A to 25B does not exist as shown in Fig. 1B . However, depending on the inclination degree of the scanner, the inclined side becomes bright and the opposite side becomes dark, generating an area, from which the infrared reflection light cannot be received.     [0036]    Since the size of a dot 3 in the dot pattern layer 4 is about 50 m and the size of a cell 10 in the infrared diffusion layer 5 is several nanometers to several tens nanometers, there are several hundreds to several thousands of polymer molecules 19 of the cells 10 in the infrared diffusion layer 5 for one dot 3 in the dot pattern layer 4. As the image of one dot 3 is captured by diffuse reflection of the several hundreds to several thousands of polymer molecules 19 of the cells 10, infrared reflection light from a micrometer-level minute area can be accurately read in nanometer level.     (Infrared reflection layer)    [0037]    The infrared reflection layer 6 is formed by arranging the orientations of a plurality of cells 10 in a manner in which the orientations of the spiral axes SA of the cells 10, in which polymer molecules 9 are laminated in the same direction, become perpendicular to the grid sheet 1 so as to selectively reflect infrared light. The infrared light irradiated from the IR-LED is diffusely reflected by the infrared diffusion layer 5 and the infrared light IR transmitted through the infrared diffusion layer 5 is specularly reflected by the infrared reflection layer 6. The infrared diffusion layer 5 can also function as infrared reflection layer 6, as long as the infrared diffusion layer 5 sufficiently reflects the infrared light and a bright and clear dot pattern 7 is imaged.     [0038]    According to the first embodiment, since the orientation angles of the plurality of cells 10 where polymer molecules 9 are laminated in the same direction are irregularly changed and arranged, the lens of the scanner can receive the reflection light of the infrared light from the entire imaging area. However, depending on the inclination angle of the scanner, the inclined side becomes bright and the opposite side becomes dark, generating an area, from which the infrared reflection light cannot be received.     <Second embodiment>    (Infrared diffusion layer)    [0039]    Fig. 5 is a section view schematically illustrating diffuse reflection of an infrared diffusion layer of the grid sheet of the second embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 5 , the infrared diffusion layer 25 of the grid sheet 21 of the second embodiment is formed by regularly changing and arranging the orientation angles of the plurality of cells 10, where polymer molecules 9 are laminated in the same direction so as to selectively reflect infrared light, with respect to the plane surface of the grid sheet 21.     [0040]    As the orientation angles of the cells 10 of the infrared diffusion layer 25 with respect to the plane surface of the grid sheet 21 regularly vary, the orientations of the spiral axes SA also regularly vary. Thus, when infrared light is irradiated from the IR-LED, the infrared light reflected by the polymer molecules 9 of the cells 10 is uniformly diffusely reflected with repeated dense and sparse portions in nanometer level.     [0041]    By diffuse reflection of the infrared diffusion layer 25, the lens of the scanner can receive reflection light, from the entire imaging area, of the infrared light irradiated from the IR-LED regardless of the contact angle of the scanner with respect to the plane surface of the grid sheet 21. When the scanner is inclined and infrared reflection light from the area in the outer inclination direction lacks brightness or when infrared light is irradiated from outside of the scanner and infrared reflection light from the surrounding area of the imaging area lacks brightness, illuminance of the IR-LED is set to increase. When the IR-LED irradiates infrared light for predetermined time at predetermined intervals, the irradiation time may be made longer. As an alternative measure, electric current supplied to the IR-LED may be increased or the gain thereof may be increased upon imaging.     [0042]    According to the second embodiment, since the orientation angles of the plurality of cells 10 where polymer molecules 9 are laminated in the same direction are regularly varied and arranged, the lens of the scanner can receive reflection light of the infrared light, which is diffusely reflected from the entire imaging area, while the infrared reflection light becomes repeatedly dense and sparse in nanometer level. When the scanner is inclined, since the amount of incident light decreases in the area in the outer inclination direction and the area surrounding the imaging area, the received reflection light of the infrared light also decreases.     <Third embodiment>    (Infrared diffusion layer)    [0043]    Figs. 6A and 6B are a section view schematically illustrating diffuse reflection of an infrared diffusion layer of the grid sheet of the third embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figs. 6A and 6B , the infrared diffusion layer 35 of the grid sheet 31 of the third embodiment is formed by arranging a plurality of cells 10, 20, 30, which selectively reflect infrared light of different wavelengths, IR1, IR2, IR3, with irregular orientation angles.     [0044]    The cells 10, 20, 30 can respectively reflect infrared light at peak wavelengths; for example, the infrared light IR1 of around 840 nm is selectively reflected by the cells 10, the infrared light IR2 of around 850 nm is selectively reflected by the cells 20, and the infrared light IR3 of around 860 nm is selectively reflected by the cells 30 by changing the product of the spiral pitch of the polymer molecules 19, 2909 of the cells 10, 20, 30 and the average refractive index of the liquid crystal. In this way, infrared light in-between infrared light IR1 and IR2 and in-between IR2 and IR3 can also be reflected ( Fig. 6B ). While IR1 to IR3 are used in this example, the infrared light wavelength may be further divided and infrared light of a wavelength that the cells 20 selectively reflect can be further selectively reflected.     [0045]    The infrared reflection layer 36 is formed by arranging a plurality of cells 10, 20, 30 in order so that the orientations of the spiral axes SA1, SA2, SA3 of the spiral structures of the cells 10, 20, 30, in which polymer molecules 19, 2909 that selectively reflect infrared light IR1, IR2, IR3 are laminated in the same direction, become perpendicular to the grid sheet 31.     [0046]    Since the cells 10, 20, 30 of the infrared diffusion layer 35 are arranged with irregularly varied orientation angles, the infrared diffusion layer 35 has many cells 10, 20, 30, of which the orientations of spiral axes SA1, SA2, SA3 are not arranged perpendicular to the grid sheet 1. The infrared diffusion layer 35 diffusely reflects the infrared light IR1, IR2, IR3 irradiated from the IR-LED in a reflection angle  direction that is different from the incident angle  by the polymer molecules 19, 2909 of the cells 10 where the orientations of the spiral axes SA1, SA2, SA3 are not arranged perpendicular to the grid sheet 31.     [0047]    For example, when infrared light IR1 is irradiated from the IR-LED, the irradiated infrared light IR1 is diffusely reflected by the polymer molecules 19 of the cells 10, while being transmitted through the cells 20 and 30. When infrared light IR2 is irradiated from the IR-LED, the irradiated infrared light IR2 is diffusely reflected by the polymer molecules 29 of the cells 20, while being transmitted through the cells 10 and 30. When infrared light IR3 is irradiated from the IR-LED, the irradiated infrared light IR3 is diffusely reflected by the polymer molecules 39 of the cells 30, while being transmitted through the cells 10 and 20. If the reflection peaks of the cells 10, 30 for the infrared light from the IR-LED are adjacent, a portion of the infrared light is transmitted through the cells 20 that have a reflection peak at another wavelength and the rest of the infrared light is diffusely reflected.     [0048]    When infrared light in a wavelength band of infrared light IR1 to infrared light IR3 is irradiated from the IR-LED, the polymer molecules 19 of the cells 10 selectively and diffusely reflect infrared light IR1; the polymer molecules 29 of the cells 20, infrared light IR2; and the polymer molecules 39 of the cells 30, infrared light IR3.     [0049]    The infrared light of wavelengths from infrared light IR1 to IR3 that is irradiated from the IR-LED is diffusely reflected by the infrared diffusion layer 35, and the infrared light IR1 to IR3 transmitted through the infrared diffusion layer 35 is specularly reflected by the infrared reflection layer 36, thus, the lens of the scanner can receive infrared light of wavelengths IR1 to IR3 irradiated from the IR-LED and the C-MOS sensor can image bright and clear dot patterns. However, depending on the inclination angle of the scanner, the inclined side may become bright and the opposite side may become dark, generating an area, from which the infrared reflection light cannot be received.     [0050]    It should be noted that equipping the infrared reflection layer 36 is not essential, and the infrared diffusion layer 5 can also function as the infrared reflection layer 6, as long as the infrared diffusion layer 5 can sufficiently reflect infrared light when the infrared reflection light IR lacks brightness, and a bright and clear dot pattern 7 can be imaged. Alternatively, the illuminance of IR-LED may be increased to compensate the brightness. When the IR-LED irradiates infrared light for predetermined time at predetermined intervals, the intervals may be shortened and/or irradiation time may be made longer.     <Fourth embodiment>    (Infrared diffusion layer)    [0051]    Fig. 7 is a section view schematically illustrating diffuse reflection of an infrared diffusion layer of the grid sheet of the fourth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 7 , the infrared diffusion layer 45 of the grid sheet 41 of the fourth embodiment is formed by arranging orientation angles of a plurality of kinds of cells 10, 20, 30, which selectively reflect different infrared wavelengths of IR1, IR2, IR3, so as to maintain regularity where the ratio of cells that specularly reflect infrared light is a third, as well as, make the cells 10, 20, 30 specularly reflect infrared light in order. While IR1 to IR3 are used in this example, the infrared light wavelength may be further divided and infrared light of a wavelength that the cells 20 selectively reflect can be further selectively reflected.     [0052]    Since the cells are arranged in a manner in which the ratio of the cells that specularly reflect infrared light becomes a third, as well as, the cells 10, 20, 30 specularly reflect infrared light in order, when infrared light IR1, IR2, and IR3 is independently irradiated and when infrared light of a wavelength band from infrared light IR1 to IR3 is irradiated from the IR-LED, the minimum reflection light of infrared light In1, IR2, or IR3 in the normal line direction of the grid sheet 41 is assured.     <Fifth embodiment>    (Infrared diffusion layer)    [0053]    Fig. 8 is a section view schematically illustrating diffuse reflection of an infrared diffusion layer of the grid sheet of the fifth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 8 , the infrared diffusion layer 55 of the grid sheet 51 of the fifth embodiment is formed by arranging the orientation angles of a plurality of kinds of cells 10, 20, 30, which selectively reflect different infrared wavelengths of IR1, IR2, IR3, so as to maintain regularity where the ratio of cells that specularly reflect infrared light is a half, as well as, make the cells 10, 20, 30 specularly reflect infrared light in order. While IR1 to IR3 are used in this example, the infrared light wavelength may be further divided and infrared light of a wavelength that the cells 20 selectively reflect can be further selectively reflected.     [0054]    Since the cells are arranged in a manner in which the ratio of the cells that specularly reflect infrared light becomes a half, as well as, the cells 10, 20, 30 specularly reflect infrared light in order, when infrared light IR1, IR2, and IR3 is independently irradiated and when infrared light of a wavelength band from infrared light IR1 to IR3 is irradiated from the IR-LED, the amount of the reflection light of infrared light IR1, IR2, IR3 in the normal line direction of the grid sheet 51 becomes larger than the fifth embodiment.     <Sixth embodiment>    (Infrared diffusion layer)    [0055]    Fig. 9 is a section view schematically illustrating diffuse reflection of an infrared diffusion layer of the grid sheet of the sixth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 9 , the infrared diffusion layer 65 of the grid sheet 61 of the sixth embodiment is made by crushing the cells 10 that reflect infrared light IR, mixing with a solvent 68 that has the same refractive index as the cells 10, and coating the support body 8 with the mixture. The crushed cells 10 are arranged in a variety of directions when mixed in the solvent 68, and such a state where the crushed cells 10 are arranged in a variety of directions is maintained in the solvent 68.     [0056]    As the surfaces of the crushed cells 10 are arranged in a variety of directions in nanometer level, the infrared light IR is diffusely reflected. By making the refractive index of the solvent 68 the same as the refractive index of the cells 10, the grid sheet can be prevented from being cloudy, which happens when all visible light is reflected off the surfaces of the crushed cells 10 arranged in a variety of directions, thus, the grid sheet can be used as a transparent sheet.     <Seventh embodiment>    (Cell of infrared diffusion layer)    [0057]    Fig. 10 is a projection view schematically showing a cell of an infrared diffusion layer of the grid sheet of the seventh embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 10 , the cell 70 is made of a nematic liquid crystal polymer with an oblique lamination of a plurality of layers of polymer molecules 79, where each of the layers has a molecular sequence aligned in one direction, and the cell has a spiral structure where each layer is twisted a little from an adjacent layer.     [0058]    The cell 70 selectively reflects only the incident light of the infrared light IR4 of a wavelength that is determined by the product of a spiral pitch P2 between the polymer molecules 79 and the average refractive index R2 of liquid crystal, symmetrically about the spiral axis SA4 of the spiral structure that is formed obliquely in the pillar-shaped cell 70. Since the selected wavelength is infrared light, the liquid crystal becomes transparent.     <Eighth embodiment>    (Infrared diffusion layer)    [0059]    Fig. 11 is a section view schematically illustrating diffuse reflection of an infrared diffusion layer of the grid sheet of the eighth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 11 , the infrared diffusion layer 85 of the grid sheet 81 of the eighth embodiment is formed by arranging a plurality of pillar-shaped cells 70, in which polymer molecules 79 are obliquely laminated in the same direction so as to selectively reflect infrared light IR4, in parallel to one another along the grid sheet 81.     [0060]    The infrared diffusion layer 85 includes many cells 70, of which orientation of the spiral axis SA4 is not arranged perpendicular to the grid sheet 81. The infrared light IR1 irradiated from the IR-LED is reflected in a reflection angle  direction that is different from the incident angle  with respect to the grid sheet 81 by the polymer molecules 79 of the cells 70. Since the orientations of the spiral axes SA4 of adjacent cells 70 in the infrared diffusion layer 85 irregularly vary, the reflection light of the infrared light IR4 is diffusely reflected.     [0061]    By diffuse reflection of the infrared diffusion layer 85, the lens of the scanner can receive reflection light, from the entire imaging area, of the infrared light IR4 irradiated from the IR-LED of the scanner.     [0062]    By diffuse reflection of the infrared diffusion layer 85, the lens of the scanner can receive reflection light, from the entire imaging area, of the infrared light IR4 irradiated from the IR-LED regardless of the contact angle of the scanner with respect to the plane surface of the grid sheet 81. When the scanner is inclined and infrared reflection light from the area in the outer inclination direction lacks brightness, or, when infrared light is irradiated from outside of the scanner and infrared reflection light from the surrounding area of the imaging area lacks brightness, the illuminance of the IR-LED is set to increase. When the IR-LED irradiates infrared light for predetermined time at predetermined intervals, irradiation time may be made longer. As an alternative measure, electric current supplied to the IR-LED may be increased or the gain thereof may be increased upon imaging.     <Ninth embodiment>    (Infrared recursive reflection layer)    [0063]    Fig. 12 is a section view schematically illustrating recursive reflection of an infrared recursive reflection layer of the grid sheet of the ninth embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Fig. 12 , the infrared recursive reflection layer 95 of the grid sheet 91 of the ninth embodiment includes transparent base materials 98a and 98b, intermediate layers 96a and 96b in-between the base materials, and an optical functional layer 90, in-between the intermediate layers 96a and 96b, which has a surface layer 90a where trigonal pyramid-shaped concavities 92 having a right angle at the apex at the bottom are two-dimensionally arranged and a transparent body 90b, of which back surface is formed flat.     [0064]    The concavities 92 of the optical functional layer 90 are formed in generally the same shape and size, the angles and sizes of the apexes may be minutely changed for each area or in a cycle. For example, the interval between the apexes of trigonal pyramid-shaped concavities 92 is defined as several tens to several hundred micrometers; the depth of the concavity 92, 10 to 100 micrometers; and, the depth dimension/plane dimension of the concavity 92, 0.5 or more.     [0065]    The light transmissive body 90b is formed of a transparent resin material, for example, formed of thermoplastics resin, thermosetting resin, energy beam-curing resin, or the like. Particularly, favorable polymers for the light transmissive body 90b include polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate, polyethylene-terephthalate, and polyfunctional acrylate, or crosslinked acrylate, such as epoxy, and a compound of acrylic urethane and monofunctional and polyfunctional monomers. The light transmissive body 90b has a function as a support body supporting the optical functional layer 90 and is formed in a film shape, sheet shape, or plate shape of a predetermined thickness.     [0066]    The surface layer 90a includes an optical multilayer film that reflects light of an infrared range and transmits light of a visible light range and is formed as a laminated film that alternately laminates a metal layer that has high reflectivity in the infrared region and an optical transparent layer or transparent conducting film that functions as an antireflection layer that has high refractive index in the visible region.     [0067]    The metal layer with high reflectivity in the infrared region may contain, for example, a simple substance, such as Au, Ag, Cu, Al, Ni, Cr, Ti, Pd, Co, Si, Ta, W, Mo, Ge, or alloy including two or more kinds of these simple substances, as main components. Further, if an alloy is used as a material of the metal layer, the metal layer may contain AlCu, AITi, AlCr, AICo, AINdCu, AlMgCu, AgPdCu, AgPdTi, AgCuTi, AgPdCagPdMg, AgPdFe, or the like.     [0068]    The optical transparent layer contains a high dielectric, such as niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, titanium oxide, as a main component. The transparent conducting film contains, for example, zinc oxide, indium-doped tin oxide, or the like as a main component.     [0069]    The surface layer 90a, without limitation to a multilayer film constituted of thin films made of inorganic materials, may be a film, in which a thin film made of a polymeric material and a layer where minute particles are scattered in polymers are laminated. The surface layer 90a is formed, on the light transmissive body 90b, with a generally even film thickness d1 that can reflect light of an infrared range.     [0070]    The light transmissive body 90b is formed of a resin material that has a softening point at a temperature of 140C or more, 150C or more, or 170C or more. The light transmissive body 90b has a loss modulus of 1.0  10<-6>Pa or more at 140C and a frequency of 1 Hz. When the storage modulus is less than 1.0 x 10<-6>Pa, the surface layer 90a may be deformed with possible deterioration in retroreflective ability upon thermocompression bonding.     [0071]    The intermediate layer 96a formed between the optical functional layer 90 and the transparent base material 98a embeds the surface layer 90a of the optical functional layer 90. As such, the intermediate layer 96a has a refractive index that is generally the same refractive index as the light transmissive body 90b so as to maintain clearness of the image transmitted through the grid sheet 91.     [0072]    The intermediate layer 96a and intermediate layer 96b are formed of transparent thermoplastic resin. The intermediate layer 96b facilitates the light transmissive body 90b of the optical functional layer 90 to be bonded on the transparent base material 98b by a transparent adhesive layer 97b; and the intermediate layer 96a facilitates the surface layer 90a of the optical functional layer 90 to be bonded on the transparent base material 98a by a transparent adhesive layer 97a.     [0073]    As a material of intermediate layers 96a and 96b, for example, a resin material, such as polymers or the like, which has a softening point at a temperature of 130C or less, such as ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and polyvinyl butyral (PVB), may be used.     [0074]    As shown in Fig. 12 , as the section of the surface layer 90a where concavities 92 of a triangular pyramid shape are two-dimensionally arranged shows rectangular equilateral triangles, the infrared light IR irradiated to the grid sheet 91 is transmitted through the dot pattern layer 4 and the transparent base material 98a and specularly reflected by one side of a concavity 92 of a rectangular equilateral triangle formed on the surface layer 90a of the optical functional layer 90 and specularly reflected again by the opposing slant face of the rectangular equilateral triangle.     [0075]    As such, the infrared light IR irradiated from the IR-LED of the scanner to the grid sheet 91 is transmitted through the dot pattern layer 4, refracted at the transparent base material 98a and the intermediate layer 96a, and specularly reflected by the two sides that has a right angle of the rectangular equilateral triangle in-between, whereby the infrared light IR is recursively reflected with directivity to the IR-LED of the scanner which is the incident direction thereof. The angle of the concavity of the rectangular equilateral triangle is finely adjusted so that the lens adjacent to the IR-LED of the scanner can receive reflection light of the recursively reflected infrared light IR.     [0076]    Whereas, the visible light is transmitted through the surface layer 90a and the light transmissive body 90b of the optical functional layer 90 and exited from the side of the transparent base material 98b. In this way, the display under the grid sheet 91 can be viewed.     [0077]    According to the ninth embodiment, by recursive reflection of the infrared recursive reflection layer 95, the infrared light IR irradiated from the IR-LED of the scanner is returned and received by the lens of the scanner. As such, the scanner can receive reflection light, from the entire imaging area, of the infrared light IR irradiated from the IR-LED regardless of the contact angle of the scanner with respect to the plane surface of the grid sheet 91.     <Tenth embodiment>    (Infrared recursive reflection layer)    [0078]    Fig. 13 is a section view schematically illustrating recursive reflection of an infrared recursive reflection layer of the grid sheet of the tenth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 13 , the infrared recursive layer 105 of the grid sheet 101 of the tenth embodiment includes a transparent resin binder material 108a, a transparent resin binder material 108b, and an optical functional layer 100 that has a bead layer 103b and a bead reflection layer 103a, where hemisphere-like concavities 102 that hold the beads 103 of the bead layer 103b are two-dimensionally arranged, in-between the transparent resin binder materials.     [0079]    The bead 103 may be either glass or resin, as long as the bead has high sphericity and transparent, and fixed by the transparent resin binder material 108 in a manner in which the transparent resin binder material 108 embeds the whole bead 103. The transparent resin binder material 108 is formed of a transparent resin material such as, acrylic resin, epoxy resin, polyvinylidene fluoride resin, polyester, polyimide, polyolefin resin, vinyl chloride resin, and a blend material thereof without particularly limiting the material as long as the material of the transparent resin binder material 108 is transparent. The transparent resin binder material 108b has a function as a support body supporting the optical functional layer 100 and is formed in a film shape, sheet shape, or plate shape of a predetermined thickness.     [0080]    The position of a focus in this bead layer 103b is determined by the size and the refractive index of the bead 103, the thickness of the bead layer 103b, and the refractive index of the transparent resin binder material 108. While the beads 103 are made of glass with a particle diameter of about 40 to 60 m and the same size, larger-sized beads of 0.1 mm or more may also be used. The refractive index of the bead 103 is defined as a high refractive index of, for example, about 2.2 such that the focus point is located at the spherical surface of the bead 103.     [0081]    The bead reflection layer 103a is formed of a vapor-deposited aluminum film, an electrodeposition coating film of silver or the like, or other material that has optical reflection characteristics. The bead reflection layer 103a is formed of a generally even film thickness d2 so that light of an infrared range can be reflected along the bead layer 103b.     [0082]    The infrared light IR irradiated to the grid sheet 101 is transmitted through the dot pattern layer 4 and the transparent resin binder material 108a, refracted at the bead layer 103b, reflected off the surface of the bead reflection layer 103a that is located at a focus point, refracted again at the bead layer 103b, and recursively reflected with directivity in the incident direction thereof. The visible light is transmitted through the bead layer 103b and bead reflection layer 103a of the optical functional layer 100 and exited from the side of the transparent resin binder material 108b. In this way, the display under the grid sheet can be viewed.     [0083]    As such, the infrared light IR irradiated from the IR-LED of the scanner to the grid sheet 101 is refracted at the bead layer 103b, reflected off the surface of the bead reflection layer 103a located at the focus point, and refracted again at the bead layer 103b, whereby the infrared light IR is recursively reflected with directivity in the incident direction to the IR-LED of the scanner. The distance between the bead 103 and the concavity 102 on the surface of the bead reflection layer 103a is finely adjusted so that the lens adjacent to the IR-LED of the scanner can receive the reflection light of the recursively reflected infrared light IR.     [0084]    According to the tenth embodiment, by recursive reflection of the infrared recursive reflection layer 105, the infrared light IR irradiated from the IR-LED of the scanner is returned and received by the lens of the scanner. As such, the scanner can receive reflection light, from the entire imaging area, of the infrared light IR irradiated from the IR-LED regardless of the contact angle of the scanner with respect to the surface plane of the grid sheet 101.     <Eleventh embodiment>    [0085]    Fig. 14 is a diagram showing an example where the grid sheet of the invention is used for a printed matter. Fig. 15 is a diagram schematically showing an enlarged view of the grid sheet of the eleventh embodiment of the invention used for a printed matter of Fig. 14 . The printed matter of Fig. 14 is printed with a plurality of dots , , ,  with inks that absorb infrared light of different wavelengths, the size of the dots , , ,  of the grid sheet 111 is about 50 m, which is hard to be seen by eyes. The grid lines in vertical and horizontal directions and diagonal lines in Fig. 15 are given for illustration only, and do not exist in a real printing surface. Further, the shapes of the dots , , ,  of Fig. 15 are only for illustration, and the shapes and colors of the dots are not limited to those of Fig. 15 .     [0086]    Further, in Fig. 15 , the intersection of diagonal lines that connect reference dots at four corners is defined as a virtual grid point, and an information dot is arranged with this virtual grid point as reference. However, this only shows the state of the dot pattern when it is generated. In reality, if the scanner is inclined or the paper is curved, the dot pattern is deformed. Thus, the virtual grid point is not calculated by diagonally connecting the reference dots. Calculation of the virtual reference points will be described with reference to Fig. 38 .     [0087]    As shown in Fig. 15 , for example, the dot pattern layer 114 of the grid sheet 111 is printed with reference grid point dots  at four corners forming a virtual grid, an information dot  and an information dot  for recognition of information that is arranged at the end point of a vector expressed with the start point at a virtual grid point 112 at the center surrounded by the reference grid point dots  at four corners, and a key dot  indicating a dot pattern of one block by shifting the four reference grid point dots  at the four corners of the block in a certain direction.     [0088]    The information dot  and the information dot  are expressed by the direction and length of a vector with the virtual grid point 112 as the start point. For example, 4 bits can be expressed by one reference grid by arranging information dots  and , which are long and short distances from the virtual grid point 112, in eight directions by rotating the information dots  and  45 degrees by 45 degrees in a clockwise direction with the virtual grid point 112 as the center. Since one block is formed by 16 reference grids 113,4 bits x 16 dots = 64 bits can be expressed by one block of a dot pattern 1.     [0089]    In Fig. 15 , for example, two information dots  and --an information dot  that is printed with an ink that particularly absorbs infrared light IR1 that has a peak wavelength at around 840 nm and an information dot  that is printed with an ink that particularly absorbs infrared light IR1 that has a peak wavelength at least at around 860 nm--are provided at least within a reference grid 113.     [0090]    Fig. 16 is a section view schematically showing a dot pattern layer and an infrared diffusion layer of the grid sheet of the eleventh embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 16 , the grid sheet 111 comprises a dot pattern layer 114 where information dots  that absorb infrared light IR1 of a wavelength of 840 nm and information dots  that absorb infrared light IR1 of a wavelength of 860 nm are arranged in accordance with a predetermined rule and an infrared diffusion layer 35 of the third embodiment where the orientation angles of a plurality of cells 10, 20, 30 that selectively reflect infrared light of different wavelengths IR1, IR2, IR3 are irregularly varied and arranged. While IR1 to IR3 are used in this example, the infrared light wavelength may be further divided and infrared light of a wavelength that the cells 20 selectively reflect can be further selectively reflected.     [0091]    Fig. 17 is a diagram showing an example of output characteristics of IR-LED1 that irradiates infrared light to the grid sheet of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 17 , the IR-LED1 has a sharp output peak at a wavelength of 840 nm. Fig. 18 is a diagram illustrating the infrared absorption rate of information dots when infrared light of 840 nm is irradiated from the IR-LED1 to reference grids.     [0092]    When the infrared light IR is irradiated from the scanner to the reference grids 113, the information dots  absorb a large amount of infrared light IR1 as the information dots  are printed with an ink that contains a characteristic material that absorbs infrared light IR1, thus, the C-MOS sensor captures the image of the portion of the information dots. in thick black. Since the information dots  do not absorb infrared light IR1, the infrared light IR1 is transmitted through the information dots o and reaches the infrared diffusion layer 35 and diffusely reflected by the polymer molecules 19 of the cells 10 of the infrared diffusion layer 35, thus, the C-MOS sensor captures the image of the information dots  in thin black. That is, the information dots  absorb only a portion of infrared light IR1 and the rest of the infrared light is reflected and imaged in thin black. The information dots  and the information dots  can be distinguished from the information dots  using thresholds.     [0093]    Fig. 19 is a diagram showing an example of output characteristics of IR-LED2 that irradiates infrared light to the grid sheet of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 19 , the IR-LED2 has a sharp output peak at a wavelength of 860 nm. Fig. 20 is a diagram illustrating the infrared absorption rate of information dots when infrared light of 860 nm is irradiated from the IR-LED2 to reference grids.     [0094]    When the infrared light IR2 is irradiated to the reference grids 113, since the information dots  absorb only a portion of the infrared light IR2, the rest of the infrared light IR2 is transmitted through the information dots 34 and reaches the infrared diffusion layer 35, and the infrared light IR2 that is diffusely reflected by the polymer molecules 29 of the cells 20 of the infrared diffusion layer 35 is captured by the C-MOS sensor and imaged in thin black. The information dots  absorb a large amount of the infrared light IR2 as the information dots  are printed with an ink that contains a characteristic material that absorbs infrared light IR2, thus, the C-MOS sensor captures the image of the information dots  in thick black. That is, the information dots  absorb only a portion of infrared light IR1 and the rest of the infrared light is reflected and thinly imaged. The information dots  and the information dots  can be distinguished from the information dots  using thresholds.     [0095]    Fig. 21 is a diagram showing an example of output characteristics of IR-LED3 that irradiates infrared light to the grid sheet of the present invention. Fig. 22 is a diagram illustrating the infrared absorption rate of information dots when infrared light of a wavelength band from 840 to 860 nm is irradiated from the IR-LED3 to reference grids. While the IR-LED3 has an output peak in the wavelength band from 840 to 860 nm in Fig. 21 , a plurality of IR-LED1, IR-LED2, and the like, each of which has an output peak at a single wavelength, may be combined to obtain the output characteristics of Fig. 21 .     [0096]    The information dots  absorb infrared light IR1 as the information dots  are printed with an ink that contains a characteristic material that absorbs infrared light IR1, while the information dots  absorb infrared light IR2 as the information dots  are printed with an ink that contains a characteristic material that absorbs infrared light IR2. The C-MOS sensor can acquire a captured image where information dots  and information dots  are imaged in black.     [0097]    According to the eleventh embodiment, a plurality of kinds of cells 10, 20, 30 that selectively reflect infrared light of wavelengths of IR1, IR2, IR3 are provided in the infrared diffusion layer 35, and an information dot  that is printed with an ink that absorbs infrared light R1 and an information dot  that is printed with an ink that absorbs infrared light R2 are arranged within a reference grid 113 of the dot pattern layer 114. Using either infrared light R1 or infrared light R2, reference dots and information dots that are printed with an ink that absorbs a large amount of the infrared light of the wavelength are defined as true values and the other information dots are defined as false values. If the infrared light R1 or R2, of which wavelength is the same as the infrared absorption wavelength of the ink used for printing the information dots that are defined as true values, is irradiated to the dot pattern, the dots that absorb the irradiated infrared light are imaged in thick black, whereby the dot codes can be acquired from the information dots of true values. It should be noted that the information dots that are imaged in thin black may instead be defined as true values. It also should be noted that the reference dots may be imaged in thin black.     [0098]    Further, as the wavelength of the IR-LED mounted on the scanner can be measured to determine the wavelength of the infrared light, infrared light R1 and infrared light R2 can be continuously irradiated to enhance security, and code values can be acquired from the information dots irradiated by the IR-LED of the wavelength for obtaining true values. It should be noted that infrared light R3 may also be used. To further enhance security, information dots imaged in thick black upon irradiation of infrared light R1, R2 (and infrared light R3) may be used to acquire code values, and information defined by a portion of the code values may define which wavelength is irradiated from the IR-LED to capture the image of each information dot, whereby the true values of the information dots are acquired to calculate the dot codes. As described above, an image of information dots, a portion or a whole of which are imaged in thin black, may instead be used as true values. Alternatively, only the user of the scanner may operate an equipped button to use the IR-LED to irradiate the infrared light of the wavelength for acquiring true values. In such a case, the scanner may continuously irradiate either or each of the infrared light R1, 2 to acquire the true values of the information dots, while the scanner may irradiate infrared light R3 in normal use.     [0099]    That is, different information relating to a dot pattern is stored in the same continuous region by printing the dot pattern formed by a plurality of kinds of dots printed with inks that absorb infrared light of different wavelengths within the same continuous region of the grid sheet 111, whereby the information can be output depending on the wavelength of the infrared light that is irradiated to the grid sheet 111. Further, the grid sheet 111 may be a small piece of sticker, which may be used for security (authenticity determination) or traceability purposes. As such, the above sticker can be adhered to a medium or a structure formed of a material that specularly reflects or transmits infrared light, whereby only the dots can be accurately recognized. To make the dots completely invisible, the dots may be printed with an ink that absorbs infrared light or superposedly printed with an ink that is of a color, with which the superposedly printed dots cannot be distinguished, and that does not absorb infrared light. In the above security system, the dot pattern may be printed with a plurality of different infrared light absorbing inks on a medium that diffusely reflects normal infrared light without using a grid sheet.     [0100]    Further, according to the eleventh embodiment, when infrared light that has peaks at a plurality of wavelength bands from infrared light R1 to R3 is irradiated, a plurality of images including information dots  that absorb infrared light R1 and information dots  that absorb infrared light R2 can be simultaneously acquired.     [0101]    While the information dots  and information dots  have been described, the same goes to the reference grid point dots  and key dots . The dots printed on the dot pattern layer 114 are not limited to the information dots , information dots , reference grid point dots , and key dots . Any dots can be printed as long as the dots are printed with an ink that includes a characteristic material that absorbs infrared light.     [0102]    It should be noted that the area where a plurality of dots ,  that absorb infrared light of different wavelengths are printed is not limited to within a reference grid 113. Regardless of the size and shape of the area, as long as the area is continuous, the area may be printed with a plurality of dots ,  that absorb infrared light of different wavelengths.     [Twelfth embodiment]    [0103]    Fig. 23 is a section view schematically showing the grid sheet of the twelfth embodiment of the present invention used for the printed matter of Fig. 14 . As shown in Fig. 23 , the dot pattern layer 124 of the grid sheet 121 is printed with two information dots that absorb infrared light of different wavelengths for each grid area of the 16 grid areas.     [0104]    A grid area where an information dot  is printed with an ink that absorbs infrared light IR1 of a wavelength of 840 nm and an information dot  is printed with an ink that absorbs infrared light IR2 of a wavelength 860 nm is shown in white. A grid area where an information dot  is printed with an ink that absorbs infrared light IR1 of a wavelength of 860 nm and an information dot  is printed with an ink that absorbs infrared light IR2 of a wavelength of 840 nm is hatched.     [0105]    For example, if the information dots  are defined as true values and the information dots  are defined as false values, when IR-LED1 that has output characteristics as shown in Fig. 17 irradiates the grid sheet 100, the C-MOS sensor images information dots  in the white grid areas in thick black and information dots o in the hatched grid areas in thin black. When IR-LED2 that has output characteristics as shown in Fig. 19 irradiates the grid sheet 121, the C-MOS sensor images information dots  in hatched grid areas in thick black and information dots  in white grid areas in thin black. That is, in determination of Boolean values, the dots imaged in thick black by irradiation from the IR-LED1 become true values in the white grid areas, while the dots imaged in thick black by irradiation from the IR-LED2 become true values in the hatched grid areas. If only the IR-LED1 is used, the dots imaged in thick black become true values in the white grid areas, while the dots imaged in thin black become false values in the hatched grid areas. It will be appreciated that, when only the IR-LED2 is used, the contrary is applied. It should be noted that security should be assured by making where white and hatched grid areas are arranged secret to those other than authorized users. On the other hand, when both IR-LED1 and IR-LED2 are used, either ink that absorbs a wavelength of 840 nm or a wavelength of 860 nm may be used for the reference dots  and key dots . If only the IR-LED1 is used, an ink that absorbs infrared light of a wavelength of 840 nm is preferably used. An ink that absorbs infrared light of both a wavelength 840 nm and a wavelength 860 nm may instead be used for printing. It should be noted that, to further enhance security, while not shown, key dots  of false values may be printed with an ink that absorbs infrared light of a different wavelength than key dots  of true values and arranged around reference dots , preventing accurate recognition of the direction and area of the dot pattern.     [0106]    If IR-LED3 with output characteristics as shown in Fig. 21 is used to irradiate the grid sheet 121, the C-MOS sensor images the reference dots , key dots , and information dots ,  all in black. Using the IR-LED3 in combination with the IR-LED1 or IR-LED2, true information dots that are imaged in thin black can be imaged in thick black and, thus, the positions can be correctly recognized.     [0107]    According to the twelfth embodiment, when a plurality of kinds of cells 10, 20, 30 that selectively reflect infrared light of wavelengths IR1, IR2, IR3, at least any one of which is different, are provided on the infrared diffusion layer 35 of the grid sheet 121, and the grid sheet 121 is irradiated by IR-LED that irradiates infrared light of a different wavelength than the infrared light of wavelengths reflected by the cells 10, 20, 30, the whole area does not reflect infrared light and is imaged in black. Thus, to image only the dots in black and other areas in white, the wavelength of infrared light absorbed by an ink used for printing dots and the wavelength of infrared light irradiated by IR-LED need to be included in the wavelengths of infrared light that is reflected by the cells 10, 20, 30. That is, by printing a dot pattern formed by a plurality of kinds of dots that absorb infrared light of a different wavelength for each different grid area of the grid sheet 121, information can be protected by disabling output of information relating to the dot pattern when the wavelength of the infrared light absorbed by the area printed with the dot pattern and the irradiated infrared light do not match.     [0108]    If reaction can be changed using a plurality of infrared wavelengths as described above, when information dots that absorb infrared light of a different wavelength are arranged for each grid, different information can be acquired by irradiation of IR-LED of a corresponding wavelength.     [0109]    Further, according to the twelfth embodiment, as infrared light that has peaks at a plurality of wavelength bands from infrared light R1 to R3 is irradiated, a plurality of images including information dots  that absorb infrared light R1 and information dots  that absorb infrared light R2 can be simultaneously acquired.     [0110]    It should be noted that the area, in which a plurality of different kinds of dots ,  are printed, is not limited to a grid area. Regardless of the size and shape of the area, dots that absorb infrared light of a different wavelength may be printed for each block.     [0111]    In the above security system, the dot pattern may be printed with a plurality of different infrared light absorbing inks on a medium that diffusely reflects normal infrared light, instead of using a grid sheet.     [Thirteenth embodiment using Figs. 26A to 26C]    [0112]    The thirteenth embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 26A to 26C .     [0113]    The feature of the thirteenth embodiment is that a dot pattern 220 is printed on the dot pattern reading surface of the diffuse reflection sheet 210 that has a diffuse reflection layer.     [0114]    Fig. 26A is a diagram where a display 230 is arranged as a medium on the opposite side (hereinafter, referred to as ""back surface"") of the dot pattern reading surface of the diffuse reflection sheet 210. Fig. 26B is a diagram where a transparent medium 240, such as glass, as a medium is arranged on the back surface side. Fig. 26C is a diagram where a print medium 250, such as paper, as a medium is arranged on the back surface side.     [0115]    It should be noted that, in Figs. 26A and 26B , ""200"" indicates an information input assistance sheet (also referred to as a grid sheet) and ""221"" indicates a dot.     [0116]    It should be noted that, while not shown, diffuse reflection is actually performed by each cell within a diffuse reflection sheet 210.     [Fourteenth embodiment using Figs. 27A to 27C]    [0117]    The fourteenth embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 27A to 27C .     [0118]    The feature of the fourteenth embodiment is that a protection layer 260 is arranged for protecting dots 221 on the front side of the dot pattern reading surface of the diffuse reflection sheet 210 that includes a diffuse reflection layer.     [0119]    Fig. 27A is a diagram where a display 230 is arranged as a medium on the opposite side (hereinafter, referred to as ""back surface"") of the dot pattern reading surface of the diffuse reflection sheet 210. Fig. 27B is a diagram where a transparent medium 240, such as glass, as a medium is arranged on the back surface side. Fig. 27C is a diagram where a print medium 250, such as paper, as a medium is arranged on the back surface side.     [Fifteenth embodiment using Figs. 28A to 28C]    [0120]    The fifteenth embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 28A to 28C .     [0121]    The feature of the fifteenth embodiment is that a dot pattern 220 is printed on the opposite surface (hereinafter, referred to as ""back surface"") of the dot pattern reading surface of the transparent sheet 270.     [0122]    According to the fifteenth embodiment, by printing the dot pattern 220 on the back surface of the transparent sheet 270, the transparent sheet 270 can function as a protection layer for protecting the dots 221.     [0123]    Fig. 28A is a diagram where a display 230 is arranged as a medium on the back surface side of the transparent sheet 270 via the diffuse reflection sheet 210. Fig. 28B is a diagram where a transparent medium 240, such as glass, is arranged as a medium on the back surface side via a diffuse reflection layer 210. Fig. 28C is a diagram where a print medium 250, such as paper, is arranged as a medium on the back surface side via the diffuse reflection layer 210.     [Fifteenth embodiment using Figs. 28A to 28C]    [0124]    The fifteenth embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 28A to 28C .     [0125]    The feature of the fifteenth embodiment is that an information input assistance sheet 200 is adhered to or placed on a predetermined medium surface of a display 230 (medium) of the display device, for example, on the display surface or in the vicinity of the medium surface.     [0126]    It should be noted that, while a display device for PC 290 is illustrated as an example as shown in Figs. 28A to 28C without limitation, a display or a touch screen (touch panel) of a laptop PC, a tablet PC, a TV, a mobile telephone, a smartphone, and a variety of electric devices may be considered.     [0127]    The optical reading device 280 reads the dot pattern in or out of contact with the dot pattern reading surface side of the transparent sheet.     [0128]    The optical reading device 280 is connected wiredly or unwiredly with an information processing device, such as PC 290, via a USB cable.     [Description of Figs. 30A and 30B]    [0129]    Figs. 30A and 30B are explanatory diagrams for describing dots. Fig. 30A is a photograph of a read 256-tone image. Fig. 30B is a table of central coordinate values that are acquired from dots of a binary image. According to this table, information (code values) are decoded by decoding means.     <Description of dot pattern>    [0130]    The following will describe an example of the dot pattern using Figs. 31 A to 45 .     [0131]    The embodiments of the dot pattern include the following examples:     [0132]    It should be noted that the embodiments of the dot pattern are not limited to the following (1) to (4):     [0133]    (1) First example (""GRID0,"" Figs. 33A to 37B )(2) Second example (""GRID1,"" Figs. 35A , 36A , and 38 )(3) Third example (""GRID5,"" Figs. 39A to 43C )    [0134]    The information dots in the above first to third examples will be described using the following examples.     [0135]    It should be noted that examples of the information dots are not limited to the following (5) and (6).     [0136]    (4) How information dots are arranged ( Fig. 31 A to 31E )(5) Code allocation of information dot ( Fig. 32A to 32C )(6) Reading a dot pattern ( Figs. 44A to 45 )    <How information dots shown in Figs. 31 A to 31E are arranged>    [0137]    Information dots are arranged as shown in Fig. 31 A to 31 E .     [0138]    It should be noted that the arrangement of information dots is not limited to the examples of Fig. 31 A to 31E .     [0139]    That is, as shown in Fig. 31A , the amount of information can be increased by including, in addition to arranging an information dot above or below a virtual point, or left, right, or diagonal to the virtual point, a case of arranging no information dot, and cases of arranging and not arranging an information dot at a virtual point. In Fig. 31 B , an information dot is arranged in a total of four virtual regions of two rows and two columns. However, in consideration of erroneous recognition that might possibly occur when an information dot is arranged near the boundary, Fig. 31C is an example where virtual regions are arranged with certain intervals in-between. It should be noted that the information amount can be further increased by arranging a plurality of information dots within four virtual regions or by arranging no information dot.     [0140]    In Fig. 31D , an information dot is arranged within a total of nine virtual regions of three rows and three columns. It should be noted that the information amount can be further increased by arranging a plurality of information dots within nine virtual regions or by arranging no information dot.     [0141]    In Fig. 31 E , an information dot is arranged within a total of eight virtual regions that are made by connecting the middle points of a square and the diagonal lines thereof by straight lines or virtual lines. It should be noted that the information amount can be further increased by arranging a plurality of information dots within the eight virtual regions or by arranging no information dot.     [0142]    While the virtual regions of Figs. 31B to 31E are rectangles or triangles, the virtual regions do not have to be in contact with each other as in the case of Fig. 31C and the virtual regions may be any shapes, such as circles or other polygons. Furthermore, the information amount can be increased by increasing the number of virtual regions. It should be noted that the arrangement of an information dot in virtual regions is made in the same way as the arrangement method of an information dot that is arranged by being displaced in a predetermined direction by a predetermined distance from a virtual point as shown in Fig. 31A . This is because, in creating print data, no matter what kind of virtual regions might be used for arranging information dots, the arrangement position should be determined by coordinate data that indicates a certain position, which is equivalent to calculating coordinate data for arranging an information dot by displacing it from a virtual point. Also, in reading dots, with any arrangement method, dots are recognized in an image that is obtained by capturing a dot pattern by setting a dot recognition determination region of a circle, a rectangle, or the like mainly at a plurality of arrangement positions where information dots are likely arranged and determining whether there are dots within the dot recognition determination region, which also can be said equivalent to the above information dot reading method.     <Code allocation of information dot in Figs. 32A to 32C>    [0143]    The code allocation of an information dot is as shown in Figs. 32A to 32C .     [0144]    That is, an information dot may be dedicatedly allocated to a ""code value"" such as a company code as shown in Fig. 32A ; an information dot may be allocated to two data regions of ""X coordinate value"" and ""Y coordinate value"" as a code format as shown in Fig. 32B ; or an information dot may be allocated to three data regions of ""code value,"" ""X coordinate value"" and ""Y coordinate value"" as shown in Fig. 32C . If coordinate values are allocated in a rectangular region, data regions of ""X coordinate value"" and ""Y coordinate value"" may be different in order to decrease the data amount. Further, ""Z coordinate value"" may also be allocated, while not shown, in order to define height in the position coordinate. It should be noted that, if ""X coordinate value"" and ""Y coordinate value"" are allocated, as the values are position information, the coordinate values of X, Y coordinates increase by predetermined amounts in positive directions, thus, all dot patterns are not the same. Further, as evidenced from Figs. 32A to 32C , as the types of allocated codes increase, the dot recognition determination region becomes smaller, making the arrangement positions of information dots hard to be accurately recognized.     <First example (""GRID0""), Figs. 33A to 37B>    [0145]    The first example of the dot pattern is referred to by an alias of ""GRID0"" by the Applicant.     [0146]    The feature of ""GRID0"" is a use of a key dot for recognition of at least one of the range and direction of the dot pattern.     [0147]    ""GRID0"" comprises the following components as shown in Figs. 33A to 37B .     (1) Information dot    [0148]    The information dot is for storing information.     [0149]    It should be noted that how an information dot is arranged is as shown in Fig. 31A to 31E , and the code allocation of an information dot is as shown in Figs. 32A to 32C .     [0150]    It should be noted that the information amount can be increased by including a case of arranging no information dot and cases of arranging or not arranging an information dot at a virtual point.     (2) Reference dot    [0151]    The reference dots are arranged at a plurality of positions that have been set in advance.     [0152]    The reference dots are for identifying positions of virtual points or virtual regions, as will be described later.     (3) Key dot    [0153]    The key dot is arranged by displacing a reference dot or, as shown in Fig. 34A to 34C , arranged by adding a dot at a position that is displaced from the arrangement position of the reference dot. That is, if a key dot is arranged by displacing a reference dot, no reference dot is arranged at the original arrangement position of the reference dot as the reference dot is displaced. Thus, the key dot also plays a role of the original reference dot. The original position of the reference dot is preferably able to be anticipated from the positions of other reference dots. If a key dot is arranged additionally at a position displaced from the arrangement position of the reference dot, both reference dot and key dot are arranged in the vicinity of each other.     [0154]    The key dot is for specifying a reference direction of an information dot with reference to reference dots and a virtual point or of an information dot that is arranged within reference dots and a virtual region. By defining this reference direction, information can be given and read in the direction of an information dot with reference to a virtual point. Further, the key dot can specify the range of a dot pattern that defines a piece of data with a plurality of information dots. As such, even if dot patterns are arranged up, down, left, and right of one another, a range of a dot pattern can be read and the data can be decoded.     (4) Virtual point or virtual region    [0155]    The virtual point or the virtual region is specified by the arrangement of reference dots. As shown in Figs. 35A to 35C , if information is defined by at least any one of a distance and a direction from a virtual point, for the direction, information may be defined based on the above-described key dot that represents the direction of the dot pattern as a reference. For the distance, a distance between predetermined reference dots may be used as a reference. It should be noted that, if information is defined by arranging virtual regions, using the center or a representative point of a plurality of virtual regions as a virtual point for assigning a piece of information, the position of the virtual point is identified by the arrangement of reference points as described above, and the virtual regions may be defined by a distance and a direction from the virtual point. Further, the arrangement positions of all virtual regions may be directly identified by the arrangement of reference dots. It should be noted that, while the adjacent virtual regions may be coupled, virtual regions are preferably arranged with certain intervals in-between, as an information dot that is arranged near the boundary may possibly transmit misrecognition.     [0156]    Figs. 33A to 33C show general examples of the dot pattern of ""GRID0."" Fig. 33A is an example of arranging reference dots in a generally plus sign shape. Fig. 33B is an example of increasing the number of arranged information dots. Fig. 33C is an example of arranging reference dots in a hexagon shape.     [0157]    The general examples of the dot pattern are not limited to the generally plus sign shape or a generally hexagon shape as exemplified in Figs. 33A to 33C . Figs. 34A to 34C show variants of Figs. 33A to 33C , where a key dot is arranged additionally at a position displaced from the arrangement position of a reference dot. As the result, both reference dot and key dot are arranged adjacent to each other.     [0158]    Figs. 35A to 35C show variants of the dot pattern of ""GRID0."" Fig. 35A is an example of arranging reference dots in generally square shapes. Fig. 35B is an example of arranging reference dots in a generally L-shape. Fig. 35C is an example of arranging reference dots in a generally cross shape or a generally plus shape.     [0159]    It should be noted that the variants of the dot pattern are not limited to the generally square shapes, generally L shape, generally cross shape, or generally plus shape as exemplified in Figs 35A to 35C .     [0160]    Figs. 36A to 37B show coupling examples and concatenation examples of the dot pattern of ""GRID0."" Fig. 36A shows a coupling example where a plurality of pieces of dot patterns in which reference dots are arranged in generally square shapes are arranged in contact to one another such that a portion of the reference dots is shared among the dot patterns. The condition of coupling is that the positions of dots on both sides of top and bottom and/or left and right are vertically and/or horizontally at the same positions in a piece of dot pattern. It should be noted that the dot patterns may be coupled only top and bottom to one another or left and right to one another. Fig. 36B shows a first concatenation example in which a plurality of pieces of dot patterns, in each of which reference dots are arranged in a generally L shape, are arranged independently from one another. Fig. 37A shows a second concatenation example in which a plurality of pieces of dot patterns, in each of which reference dots are arranged in a generally plus shape, are arranged independently of one another. It should be noted that concatenation refers to a method of arranging dot patterns top, bottom, left, and right of one another with predetermined intervals. Fig. 37B is a coupling example where a plurality of pieces of dot patterns, in each of which reference dots are arranged in a hexagon shape, are arranged adjacent to one another such that a portion of the reference dots is shared among the dot patterns.     [0161]    Further, the coupling examples and the concatenation examples of the dot pattern are not limited to the arrangements exemplified in Figs. 36A and 36B and Figs. 37A and 37B .     <Second example (""GRID1"")>    [0162]    The second example of the dot pattern is referred to by an alias of ""GRID1"" by the Applicant.     [0163]    ""GRID1"" is made by limiting the arrangement of the reference dots of ""GRID0"" as shown in Fig. 35A , which features that reference dots are arranged in rectangular shapes, for example, squares and rectangles, and that a virtual point is defined as the center of the surrounding four reference points. The center is, as shown in Fig. 38 , calculated as the coordinate value that is obtained by dividing the coordinate values of four surrounding reference points by 4. In this way, even if the arrangement of the dot pattern is distorted in a captured image due to reading of the dot pattern by an inclined optical reading device, lens distortion, or deformity of a print medium where the dot pattern is formed, the arrangement of an information dot is accurately calculated in relation to the shifted arrangement of adjacent four reference dots, as the arrangement of the information dot shifts in the same way as the four reference dots, causing little decrease in the recognition rate. Needless to say, if an information dot is arranged apart from reference dots as in Figs. 35B and 35C , the arrangement position of the information dot may not be accurately read with possible misrecognition.     [0164]    The drawings include a variant of Fig. 35A where reference dots are arranged in square shapes and a coupling example of the dot pattern of Fig. 36A where dot patterns are repeatedly arranged top, bottom, left, and right of one another and the circumference reference dots are overlapped.     [0165]    It should be noted that, while reference dots are arranged in squares as shown in Fig. 35A , the reference dots may be arranged in rectangles without limitation. Further, while reference dots are coupled as shown in Fig. 36A , adjacent dot patterns may be arranged independently from one another with predetermined intervals without limitation.     <Third example (""GRID5"")>    [0166]    The third example of the dot pattern is referred to by an alias of ""GRID5"" by the Applicant.     [0167]    ""GRID5"" uses ""the way reference dots are arranged"" instead of the key dot of ""GRID0"" for recognition of the range and direction of a dot pattern. To recognize the direction of a dot pattern by ""the way reference dots are arranged,"" the dot pattern should be axially asymmetric so that the arrangement of reference dots does not be the same as the arrangement before rotation no matter how much the reference dots are rotated with any point as a center (excluding 360 degrees). Further, even if a plurality of pieces of dot patterns are coupled or concatenated by repeatedly arranging the dot patterns top and bottom and/or left and right of one another, the ranges and orientations of the dot patterns are needed to be recognized.     [0168]    It should be noted that, even if a key dot is included as ""GRID0,"" the range and direction of the dot pattern can be recognized by ""the way reference dots are arranged"" as a dot pattern of ""GRID5"" that has no key dot by having the key dot recognized as a reference dot.     [0169]    Further, as shown in Figs. 40A to 42C , as a particular example of ""GRID5,"" ""the way reference dots are arranged"" can be used to specify only the range of a dot pattern, and the orientation of the dot pattern can be specified by the arrangement position of an information dot, that is, ""the way a virtual point is arranged,"" the orientation of a predetermined information dot, or the arrangement rule thereof. In such a case, the dot pattern may be axially symmetrical in which the arrangement of reference dots become the same as the arrangement before rotation when the reference dots are rotated with an arbitrary point as a center (excluding 360 degrees). Further, even if a plurality of pieces of dot patterns are coupled or concatenated by repeatedly arranging the dot patterns top and bottom and/or left and right of one another, only the ranges of the dot patterns should be recognized. It should be noted that this example is referred to by an alias of ""direction dot"" by the Applicant.     [0170]    Figs. 39A to 39C show general examples of the dot pattern of ""GRID5."" Fig. 39A shows an example where reference dots are arranged in a generally house shape that is asymmetric in a vertical direction. Fig. 39B is an example where reference dots are arranged in a generally cross shape that is asymmetric in a vertical direction. Fig. 39C is an example where reference dots are arranged in a generally isosceles triangle shape that is asymmetric in a vertical direction.     [0171]    It should be noted that the general examples of the dot pattern are not limited to the generally house shape, generally cross shape or generally triangle shape as exemplified in Figs. 39A to 39C .     [0172]    Figs. 40A and 40B show general examples of ""direction dot"" that defines the direction of a dot pattern. Fig. 40A arranges reference dots in a square shape in a manner surrounding information dots, and the information dot at the center thereof defines the orientation of the dot pattern as a ""direction dot"" by the displaced direction of the ""direction dot."" It should be noted that the other information dots are arranged in + and x directions. Fig. 40B arranges reference dots in a generally plus shape, and the ""direction dot"" at the center is arranged by being displaced in a certain direction, where the orientation of the dot pattern is defined by the displaced direction of the ""direction dot."" The arrangement of the ""direction dot"" that defines the orientation of the dot pattern, as shown in Figs. 40A and 40B , may be arranged by displacing the dot in any direction as long as the direction is predefined. Also, the other information dots may be defined in any manner with a distance and a direction from a virtual point.     [0173]    Figs. 41A and 41B show variants of ""direction dot."" Fig. 41A arranges reference dots in a square shape in a manner surrounding information dots, and the orientation of the dot pattern is defined by arranging information dots of + direction at three positions. It should be noted that other information dots are arranged in x direction. That is, the orientation of a dot pattern is defined by the way the ""direction dot"" is arranged, in which the arrangement rule of information dots is differentiated from the other information dots.     [0174]    Fig. 41B is an example in which the orientation of the dot pattern is defined by not arranging an information dot, that is, ""the way a virtual point is arranged."" In other words, as the reference dots are arranged in a square shape, the ""orientation"" of the dot pattern cannot be specified by the arrangement of the reference dots. As such, the ""orientation"" of the dot pattern is determined by not arranging ""reference dot"" at one position of ""virtual point"" that is arranged within the region of reference dots that are arranged in a square shape, that is, ""the way a virtual point is arranged."" It should be noted that the ""virtual point"" where ""reference dot"" is not arranged may be any one of three positions in the upper row or three positions in the lower row.     [0175]    Figs. 42A to 42C show variants of ""direction dot."" In Fig. 42A , reference dots are arranged in a top row and a bottom row and information dots are arranged in-between, and the orientation of the dot pattern is defined by the arrangement of the information dot of + direction at a position other than the vertically center position. It should be noted that other information dots are arranged in x direction. That is, the orientation of the dot pattern is defined by the way the ""direction dot"" is arranged where the arrangement rule of the information dot is differentiated from the other information dots. In Fig. 42B , the orientation of the dot pattern is determined by arranging reference dots in an equilateral triangle shape and arranging information dots in a rectangle shape inside and outside of the triangle. Fig. 42C shows a coupling example of the dot pattern of Fig. 42B. Fig. 42C is a coupling example where a plurality of pieces of dot patterns, in each of which reference dots are arranged in an equilateral triangle shape, are arranged adjacent to one another such that portions of the reference dots are shared among the dot patterns. The condition of coupling is that the positions of dots on both sides of top and bottom and/or left and right are vertically and/or horizontally at the same positions in a piece of dot pattern. It should be noted that the dot patterns may be coupled only top and bottom to one another or left and right to one another. It should be noted that, in this example, information dots on the bottom side of the equilateral triangle are shared. As such, when dot patterns are coupled, not only reference dots but also information dots can be shared. However, information dots cannot be shared when a value varies for each dot pattern such as coordinate values.     [0176]    Figs. 43A to 43C show variants of the dot pattern of ""GRID5."" Fig. 43A shows an example where reference dots are arranged in a generally square shape that is asymmetric in a vertical direction. Fig. 43B is an example where a key dot is also used and reference dots are arranged in a generally L shape that is asymmetric in a vertical direction. Fig. 43C is an example where a key dot is used and reference dots are arranged in a generally cross shape that is asymmetric in a vertical direction.     [0177]    It should be noted that the general examples of the dot pattern are not limited to the generally square shape, generally L shape, or generally cross shape that are asymmetric in a vertical direction as exemplified in Figs. 43A to 43C .     <Reading dot pattern>    [0178]    When the above dot patterns of ""GRID0,"" ""GRID1,"" ""GRID5"" define the same code values within a predetermined region and are arranged repeatedly top, down, left and right of one another, if an arbitrary region is read with a range of the same size of the range of the dot pattern as shown in Figs. 44A and 44B , information dots (1) to (16) (""circle 1 to circle 16"" in Fig. 44A ) or ( 1 ) to (9) (""circle 1 to circle 9"" in Fig. 44B ) that configure the original dot pattern are all included in the region, whereby all defined code values can be read. As such, as the arrangement of information dots can be determined based on the orientation and range of the dot pattern, the arrangement rule of the information dots that are configured as code values can also be identified. Further, as shown in Fig. 45 , in the range of the dot pattern that is read in an arbitrary region, if either left or right information dot outside the range is read, the information dot and an information dot that is located at the other end have the same defined numerical value and are arranged at positions that are displaced by the same distance in the same direction from virtual points. The line segment that connects these two information dots forms a horizontal line. By moving this horizontal line in parallel, the horizontal line that passes through the virtual points can be accurately recognized. This parallel movement is, if there is a corresponding reference dot, equivalent to a distance of the movement of the reference dot from the current position until it reaches the horizontal line. Further, for a top to down direction, if a vertical line is recognized by a like procedure, by calculating the position of an intersection of the horizontal line and the vertical line, the virtual point can be accurately calculated. According to this method, even if a dot pattern is imaged by an inclined optical reading device and the arrangement of the dots is largely deformed, the virtual point can be accurately calculated and the numerical value indicated by the information dot can be accurately recognized.     <Description of calibration>    [0179]    Figs. 46A to 55B are diagrams illustrating calibration that is performed when an information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) is used.     [Embodiment 1 of calibration; Calibration of positional relation]    [0180]    Embodiment 1 of calibration is calibration for appropriately associating the position of the information input assistance sheet 700 and the position of a medium 730 (a display 731 or a print medium 732).     [0181]    To correctly reflect touching by a user on a display 731 or a print medium 732 (printed matter) as a medium 730 to processing corresponding to the touch position, the positional relation between the display 731 or print medium 732 (printed matter) and the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) should match. Thus, calibration for appropriately relating the coordinate system of the display 731 or the print medium 732 (printed matter) and the coordinate system of the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) are performed.     [0182]    Figs. 46A to 47C are diagrams illustrating a case where calibration is performed on the display screen of the display 731.     [0183]    Figs. 46 A to 46C are diagrams illustrating a case where calibration marks 710 are provided on the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet).     [0184]    As shown in Fig. 46A , the calibration marks 710 are provided near the four corners of the one surface side of the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet). It should be noted that the calibration marks 710 are not necessarily provided near the four corners. The calibration marks may be provided at two or more corners or predetermined two or more positions.     [0185]    Calibration can be performed by a variety of methods by matching the dot coordinate values (xmi, ymi) at predetermined four mark positions in the coordinate system of the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) to the coordinate values (Xci, Yci) of the cursor positions in the coordinate system of the display screen data on the display 731. For example, by a plane projection conversion method, based on the dot coordinate values (xt, yt) of the touch position of the optical reading device 740 (scanner) in the coordinate system of the grid sheet, a coordinate value (Xt, Yt) in the coordinate system in the display image data on the display can be calculated by the following conversion equation. It should be noted that the coordinate system in the display image data of the display is a coordinate system in the image storage medium (frame buffer) for causing the display to display an image, instead of the real measure coordinate system on the display. X t = a x t + b y t c / g x t + h y t + 1<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""391707578-ib0001"" />Y t = d x t + e y t f / g x t + h y t + 1<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""391707578-ib0002"" />    [0186]    Since four mark positions (xmi, ymi, i = 1-4) and cursor positions (Xci, Yci, i = 1-4) can be determined by calibration, the positions are substituted to solve the simultaneous equation with eight unknowns to acquire a to h. In addition, an affine transformation equation and a Helmert transformation equation can be used for calibration of predetermined three or more positions. It should be noted that any of these calibration methods can be applied to calibration illustrated in Figs. 46A to 51B .     [0187]    As shown in Fig. 46B , a user moves a cursor to a calibration mark 710 and left-clicks the mouse. The central processing unit of the personal computer recognizes the clicked position. Then, the coordinate system of the display 731 and the coordinate system of the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) are appropriately associated with each other. As such, calibration can be performed.     [0188]    In Figs. 46A to 46C , calibration marks 710 are formed on detachable transparent stickers 720. After calibration, a user peels off the stickers from the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) as shown in Fig. 46C .     [0189]    It should be noted that the calibration marks 710 may be either formed on the transparent stickers 720 or directly printed on the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet). Further, the calibration marks 710 may be provided in a removable manner on the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) and may be removed from the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) after calibration.     [0190]    Figs. 47A to 47C are diagrams illustrating a case where calibration marks 710 are displayed on a display screen of the display 731.     [0191]    As shown in Fig. 47A , calibration marks 710 are displayed near the four corners of the display 731. It should be noted that the calibration marks 710 are not necessarily displayed near the four corners. The calibration marks may be displayed at two or more corners or displayed at predetermined two or more positions.     [0192]    A user touches the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) at the position where a calibration mark 710 is displayed as shown in Fig. 47C . The optical reading device 740 (scanner) reads the dot pattern on the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) and transmits the dot pattern to the personal computer (PC). The central processing unit of the personal computer (PC) recognizes the XY coordinates (X1, Y1) of the dot of the touch position from the transmitted dot pattern and performs calibration for appropriately associating the coordinate system of the display 731 to the coordinate system of the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet).     [0193]    It should be noted that it is preferable not to display the calibration marks 710 any more after calibration.     [0194]    Figs. 48A to 49B are diagrams illustrating a case where calibration is performed for a print medium 732 (printed matter).     [0195]    Figs. 48A and 48B are diagrams illustrating a case where calibration marks 710 are provided for both print medium 732 (printed matter) and information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) provided for the print medium 732 (printed matter).     [0196]    As shown in Fig. 48A , calibration marks 710 are printed near the four corners of the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) and the print medium 732 (printed matter). It should be noted that the calibration marks 710 are not necessarily printed near the four corners and may be printed at two or more corners. Alternatively, the calibration marks 710 may be printed at predetermined two or more positions.     [0197]    A user can place the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) on the print medium 732 (printed matter) by matching the calibration marks 710 of both as shown in Fig. 48B . As such, calibration for appropriately relating the coordinate system of the print medium 732 (printed matter) and the coordinate system of the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) is performed.     [0198]    Figs. 49A and 49B are diagrams illustrating a case where calibration marks 710 are printed only on a print medium 732 (printed matter).     [0199]    As shown in Fig. 49A , calibration marks 710 are printed near the four corners of the print medium 732 (printed matter). It should be noted that calibration marks 710 are not necessarily printed near the four corners, and may be printed at two or more corners. Alternatively, calibration marks 710 may be printed at predetermined two or more positions.     [0200]    A user can place the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) on the print medium 732 (printed matter). Then, as shown in Fig. 49B , the optical reading device 740 (scanner) is matched with the marks. The optical reading device 740 (scanner) reads the dot pattern on the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) and transmits the dot pattern to the personal computer (PC). The central processing unit of the personal computer (PC) recognizes the coordinate values (x1, y1) of the touch position from the transmitted dot pattern and performs calibration for appropriately associating the coordinate system of the print medium 732 (printed matter) with the coordinate system of the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet).     [0201]    Such calibration can match the positional relation between the coordinate positions of the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) and the image on the display 731 or the print medium 732 (printed matter) and accurately output information corresponding to the image and text touched by the user.     [0202]    It should be noted that, in the above-described embodiments, when an information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) is used for a display screen and the like, the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) may be used by being adhered to the display screen with adhesive, by being hooked on the upper portion of the display screen, or by other methods.     <When calibration mark is one>    [0203]    Two or more calibration marks are required in the above calibration method.     [0204]    However, calibration can be performed even with only one calibration mark. The following will describe such a case with reference to Figs. 50A to 51B .     [0205]    The dot coordinate values per unit length on the grid sheet in the coordinate system of the grid sheet and the coordinate values per unit length on the display in the coordinate system of the display image data on the display 731 or the coordinate values per unit length on the print medium in the print data coordinate system of the print medium 732 (printed matter) are stored in the storage means of the information processing device in advance. Further, when a calibration mark is touched by the optical reading device 740 (scanner), the calibration mark is touched in a predetermined axial rotation direction. In this way, calibration can be performed even with one calibration mark.     [0206]    In Fig. 50A , a calibration mark is provided at a predetermined position of a display (the center in Fig. 50A ). In Fig. 50B , a calibration mark is provided at a predetermined position of a printed matter (the lower right in Fig. 50B ). A user touches the calibration mark by the optical reading device. Calibration can be performed, upon the optical reading device touching the calibration mark, by acquiring the rotation angle of the grid sheet in a predetermined axial rotation direction (that is, the rotation angle of the grid sheet with respect to the display).     [0207]    Here, an equation for calculating the corresponding coordinate values (Xt, Yt) in the coordinate system of the display image data on the display by coordinate conversion of the dot coordinate values (xt, yt) of a touch position in the coordinate system of the grid sheet is induced.     [0208]    If the dot coordinate values per unit length on the grid sheet are defined as x, y, and the coordinate values per unit length on the display are defined as X, Y, the distortion coefficient of each coordinate axis becomes x= X/x, y= Y/y. It should be noted that, if the distortion rates of the axes are the same, x= y.     [0209]    When the axial rotation direction of the optical reading device is matched to the upward direction of the display and the calibration mark is touched through the grid sheet, if the coordinate values of the calibration mark in the coordinate system of the display image data of the display are (Xm, Ym); the dot coordinate values of the touch position on the grid sheet are (xm, ym); and the rotation angle of the grid sheet with respect to the optical reading device is m, the following equation can be acquired: X t Y t = X m Y m + cos  m sin  m  sin  m cos  m  x x t  x m  y y t  y m<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""391707578-ib0003"" />    [0210]    As such, a coordinate conversion equation in a case of only one calibration mark can be acquired. This coordinate conversion can also be used in a case where the grid sheet is placed on the printed medium 732 (printed matter).     [0211]    When a grid sheet is placed over a larger display or printed matter than the grid sheet with calibration marks arranged at corners of the display or printed matter, the grid sheet cannot cover the all corners thereof, which makes accurate calibration impossible.     [0212]    Using one calibration mark and the above equation, calibration can be accurately performed even when a grid sheet is smaller than a display or a printed matter.     <Other calibration methods>    [0213]    Figs. 51 A and 51B are diagrams illustrating still another method of calibration.     [0214]    If the optical reading device touches a calibration mark without being matched to a predetermined rotational axis direction, accurate calibration cannot be performed. In such a case, accurate calibration can be performed by providing two calibration marks arranged in a horizontal or vertical direction on a display or a print medium, calculating the inclination of the grid sheet with respect to the display or print medium by the following equation, and performing the coordinate conversion by the above conversion equation with inclination m. Fig. 86A is a case where two calibration marks are arranged in a vertical direction on a display. Fig. 86B is a case where two calibration marks are arranged in a horizontal direction on a print medium.     [0215]    When the dot coordinate values of predetermined two mark positions in the coordinate system of the information input assistance sheet 700 (grid sheet) are (xm1, ym1), (xm2, ym2), and the coordinate values of cursor positions in the coordinate system of the display image data of the display 731 are (Xc1, Yc1), (Xc2, Yc2), m= (ym2-ym1)/(xm2- xm1).If two mark positions are horizontally arranged, x= (Xc2- Xc1)/(xm2- xm1).If two mark positions are vertically arranged, y= (Yc2- Yc1)/(ym2- Ym1).It should be noted that, if the distortion rates of the axes are the same, x= y=  can be applied, and, the following equation can be obtained: X t Y t = X m 1 Y m 1 + cos  m sin  m  sin  m cos  m  x x t  x m 1  y y t  y m 1<img class=""EMIRef"" id=""391707578-ib0004"" />    [0216]    As such, a coordinate conversion equation in a case of two calibration marks can be acquired. This coordinate conversion can also be used in a case where the grid sheet is placed on the print medium 732 (printed matter).     [0217]    It will be appreciated that, when the distortion rate is unidentified as in the case of x= yin the above equation, the dot coordinate values x and/or y per unit length on the grid sheet used in the coordinate conversion equation may be stored in advance in the storage medium as information that is directly defined in the code values defined in association with the coordinate values in the grid sheet or as information corresponding to the code values.     [Embodiment 2 of calibration; Brightness calibration]    [0218]    Embodiment 2 of calibration is calibration for adjusting brightness of the optical reading device 740 (scanner).     [0219]    When a single scanner is used for both print medium 732 (normal printed matter) and grid sheet, the grid sheet and the normal printed matter have different infrared light reflection characteristics.     [0220]    If the light amount of infrared light is determined based on the infrared reflection light that has appropriate brightness with a normal printed matter, dots often cannot be recognized due to the lack of infrared reflection light and, thus, the dot codes cannot be decoded. Thus, for each grid sheet or each of a variety of printed matters that is used with a single scanner, calibration for determining the light amount of infrared light based on the infrared reflection light of appropriate brightness is preferably performed in advance.     [0221]    As such, to use calibration information (infrared light amount) that is determined in advance for each grid sheet or each of a variety of printed matters, each grid sheet or each printed matter need to be identified. This identification can be performed using a dot pattern printed on the grid sheet or printed matter.     [0222]    Fig. 52 is a dot code format when the XY coordinate values and code values are defined in a dot pattern. In such a case, the grid sheet ID, printed matter ID, or the like for specifying each grid sheet or printed matter is defined in the dot pattern as a code value.     [0223]    Fig. 53A is a dot code format when only XY coordinate values are defined in a dot pattern. In such a case, the grid sheet ID, printed matter ID, or the like for specifying a grid sheet or a printed matter is defined by a table, as shown in Fig. 53B , provided in a memory within the scanner or the like. That is, an area that is formed in a unique coordinate range is determined for each grid sheet or printed matter to identify the grid sheet or printed matter. For example, if the coordinate range is an area formed in (X1-X2, Y1-Y2), the grid sheet ID is 1.     [0224]    Further, as described above, when the infrared reflection light is lacking, such as when the scanner is inclined, real time calibration where the brightness of the captured image is measured each time and changed to an appropriate light amount in the next imaging may be performed. It will be appreciated the same can be applied to a case where dots cannot be recognized due to an excessive amount of infrared reflection light. Further, the light amount of infrared light may be controlled only by real time calibration without performing calibration in advance.     [Embodiment 3 of calibration; Calibration of size]    [0225]    Embodiment 3 of calibration is calibration for adjusting the size of a grid sheet or print medium 732.     [0226]    The dot pattern of the grid sheet or print medium 732 defines a calibration parameter as a code value as shown in Fig. 54 . Calibration is performed upon the scanner touching predetermined positions (for example, four corners) of the grid sheet or the like with the scanner, as described in the above ""Embodiment 1 of calibration."" The size of the grid sheet or printed medium 732 is recognized by this calibration. When calibration is performed again after performing the calibration once, calibrated information is retrieved from calibration parameters defined in the dot pattern only by touching with the scanner.     [0227]    It should be noted that a dot pattern may define only XY coordinate values as shown in Figs. 55A and 55B . In such a case, a calibration parameter can be defined by a table as shown in Fig. 55B . That is, an area that is formed by a unique coordinate range is determined for each grid sheet or print medium, and a calibration parameter assigned to each grid sheet or print medium can be identified. For example, if the coordinate range is an area formed by (X1-X2, Y1-Y2), the calibration parameter is 1.     [0228]    As such, by providing a calibration parameter for each grid sheet or each print medium, calibration can be performed using the same scanner among mediums having different sizes, such as an electric black board attached with a grid sheet and a notebook printed with dot patterns. Further, this calibration is also superior in convenience, as once calibration is performed, calibration will not be needed any more.     <Supplementary description of embodiments>    [0229]    The

The refrigerator includes a cabinet having a storage compartment, a first door pivotably installed to the cabinet, the first door being configured to open or close one side of the storage compartment, a second door pivotably installed to the cabinet, the second door being configured to open or close a remaining side of the storage compartment, the second door having a pillar configured to be rotated so as to come into contact with the first door, a first link device [200] provided outside of the storage compartment, the first link device [200] being operated in contact with the first door and the second door at a top of the cabinet, and a second link device [300] configured to be operated by the first link device [200], the second link device [300] serving to rotate the pillar.","REFRIGERATOR    The present invention relates to a refrigerator and, more particularly, to a refrigerator having improved convenience of use, the refrigerator being a dual door type refrigerator in which two doors are used to open a single storage compartment.     Generally, a refrigerator is an apparatus that may keep food fresh for a certain duration by cooling a storage compartment (e.g. a freezing compartment or a refrigerating compartment) while repeating a refrigeration cycle.     The refrigerator includes a compressor, which compresses refrigerant, circulating through a refrigeration cycle, into high-temperature and high-pressure refrigerant. The refrigerant compressed in the compressor cools air while passing through a heat exchanger, and the cooled air is supplied to the freezing compartment or the refrigerating compartment.     The refrigerator has a configuration in which the freezing compartment is at the upper side and the refrigerating compartment is at the lower side. A side by side type refrigerator may be configured such that the freezing compartment and the refrigerating compartment are arranged on the left and right sides, respectively, so as to be adjacent to each other.     In addition, there is another type of refrigerator in which a single storage compartment, provided in the upper or lower region of the refrigerator, may be opened by two doors, which are arranged side by side.     In the case where two doors are arranged side by side to open or close a single storage compartment, a pillar is installed on one of the two doors. The pillar is provided only at one of the two doors and is configured to come into contact with the two doors when the two doors close the storage compartment, thereby functioning to improve the sealing efficiency of the storage compartment.     According to the related art, generally, in order to rotate the pillar, a configuration including a protrusion and a guide groove is formed in an inner case of the refrigerator so as to guide the rotation of the pillar.     With the related art, therefore, a user suffers from inconvenience when using the storage compartment because the configuration for guiding the rotation of the pillar needs to be formed so as to protrude downward from the top of the inner case.     In addition, in the state in which the door provided with the pillar hermetically seals the storage compartment, the pillar is unfolded away from the corresponding door, and may block the path along which a drawer installed in the refrigerator moves. Therefore, when two drawers are installed parallel to each other, it is necessary to provide the two drawers with different widths.     In addition, it is necessary to form a basket installed on the door such that a corner of the basket defines a gently curved surface so as not to come into contact with the unfolded pillar when the basket is rotated along with the door. This may problematically cause a reduction in the storage capacity of the basket.     Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a refrigerator having improved convenience of use, the refrigerator being a dual door type refrigerator in which two doors are used to open a single storage compartment.     In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a refrigerator including a cabinet having a storage compartment, a first door pivotably installed to the cabinet, the first door being configured to open or close one side of the storage compartment, a second door pivotably installed to the cabinet, the second door being configured to open or close a remaining side of the storage compartment, the second door having a pillar configured to be rotated so as to come into contact with the first door, a first link device provided outside of the storage compartment, the first link device being operated in contact with the first door and the second door at a top of the cabinet, and a second link device configured to be operated by the first link device, the second link device serving to rotate the pillar.     The first link device may include a housing coupled to the top of the cabinet, and the housing may be located outside of the storage compartment, which is closed by the first door and the second door, cold air not being supplied to an inside of the housing.     The first link device may further include a first bar configured to be pushed by the first door, a second bar configured to be pushed by the second door, and a rotation gear engaged and rotated between the first bar and the second bar.     When any one of the first bar or the second bar is moved in a rearward direction of the cabinet, the remaining one thereof may be moved in a forward direction of the cabinet.     The first bar and the second bar may respectively include accommodation regions, in which part of the rotation gear is accommodated, and the rotation gear may be placed in the accommodation regions so as to overlap the first bar and the second bar.     The first bar and the second bar may be located lower than a maximum height of the first door and the second door.     The second link device may include a first link member configured to be pushed and operated by the first link device, a second link member configured to rotate the pillar, and a transmission member configured to transmit an operation of the first link member to the second link member.     The second link device may further include an elastic member configured to elastically support the first link member so that the first link member is moved in a rearward direction of the cabinet when external force applied to the first link member is removed.     When any one of the first link member or the second link member is moved in a rearward direction of the cabinet, a remaining one thereof may be moved in a forward direction of the cabinet.     The transmission member may include a first rotator configured to be engaged with and rotated by the first link member, a second rotator configured to be engaged with and rotated by the second link member, and a connection bar configured to connect the first rotator and the second rotator to each other.     The first rotator may be located outside a region defined by a gasket, which is located between the door and the cabinet, and the second rotator may be located inside the region defined by the gasket, which is located between the door and the cabinet.     The connection bar may vertically extend so that installation heights of the first rotator and the second rotator are different from each other.     The second link member may include a first connector configured to be engaged with and moved by the transmission member, and a second connector having one end rotatably connected to the first connector and a remaining end rotatably connected to the pillar.     The first connector may include a first extending portion configured to extend in a rearward direction of the cabinet, and a second extending portion configured to extend toward the first door at a prescribed angle in relation to the first extending portion.     The first connector may be linearly moved so as to maintain a constant distance between the second extending portion and the first door.     The second connector may include a first connecting portion connected to the second extending portion, and a second connecting portion bent from the first connecting portion at a prescribed angle.     The second connector may simultaneously perform linear movement and rotation when the first connector is linearly moved.     A connection portion of the first connecting portion and the second extending portion may be linearly moved when the first connector is linearly moved.     A connection portion of the second connecting portion and the pillar may be rotated when the first connector is linearly moved.     The second connecting portion may have the same rotation direction as a rotation direction of the pillar.     The first connecting portion may have a longer length than a length of the second connecting portion.     The refrigerator may further include a rotation assistance device installed to a rotating shaft configured to rotate the pillar, the rotation assistance device serving to assist rotation of the pillar.     The rotation assistance device may include a first cam supported by an elastic member, the first cam being rotated along with the pillar, and a second cam engaged with the first cam.     The second cam may include a first slope, and the first cam may include a protrusion, whereby the pillar may be rotated in a direction in which the pillar is unfolded when the protrusion is rotated along the first slope.     The second cam may include a second slope, and the first cam may include a protrusion, whereby the pillar may be rotated in a direction in which the pillar is folded when the protrusion is rotated along the second slope.     The pillar may be operated so as to be unfolded when the first door and the second door are changed in state so as to close the storage compartment.     In a state in which the first door and the second door close the storage compartment, the pillar may be rotated so as to be folded in relation to the second door when any one of the first door and the second door is rotated to open the storage compartment.     The refrigerator may further include a first drawer located on a side of the first door, and a second drawer located on a side of the second door, and the first drawer and the second drawer may have the same width.     The first drawer and the second drawer may be arranged in the same horizontal plane, and the first drawer and the second drawer may be configured so as to be pulled outward independently of each other.     The first door and the second door may have the same width.     In accordance with the present invention, because a structure to rotate a pillar does not protrude into a storage compartment, the capacity of the storage compartment may be increased, and user inconvenience owing to any protruding structure may be eliminated.     In addition, because the pillar is not unfolded in the state in which only a door provided with the pillar closes the storage compartment and an opposite door opens the storage compartment, a drawer installed on the side of the opposite door is not caught by the pillar when the drawer is pulled out. This may allow a pair of drawers installed on opposite sides to have the same width.     In addition, because the pillar is not unfolded in the state in which only the door provided with the pillar closes the storage compartment and the opposite door opens the storage compartment, a basket installed on the opposite door is not caught by the pillar when the opposite door is rotated. Accordingly, the basket may be formed to have an angled corner, and thus the storage capacity of the basket may be increased.     The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the invention, illustrate embodiments of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principle of the invention.     In the drawings:     FIG. 1 is a front view illustrating a refrigerator in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;     FIG. 2 is a view illustrating the closed state of a first door and a second door in accordance with the embodiment;     FIG. 3 is a view illustrating the state of a pillar in FIG. 2;     FIG. 4 is a view illustrating major components of FIG. 3;     FIG. 5 is a view illustrating the rotation of the pillar;     FIG. 6 is a view illustrating the open state of the first door in accordance with the embodiment;     FIG. 7 is a view illustrating the state of the pillar in FIG. 6;     FIG. 8 is a view illustrating the open state of the second door in accordance with the embodiment;     FIG. 9 is a view illustrating the state of the pillar in FIG. 8; and     FIG. 10 is a view illustrating a rotation assistance device to assist the rotation of the pillar.     Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in order to concretely realize the objects as set forth above.     In the drawings, the sizes or shapes of components may be exaggerated to emphasize more clearly the explanation in the drawings and for convenience. In addition, the terms, which are specially defined in consideration of the configuration and operations of the present invention, may be replaced by other terms based on intensions of users and operators or customs. The meanings of these terms should be construed based on the whole content of this specification.     FIG. 1 is a front view illustrating a refrigerator in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.     Referring to FIG. 1, the refrigerator in accordance with the embodiment includes a cabinet 1, which defines the external appearance of the refrigerator.     The cabinet 1 has a storage compartment 2 in which food may be stored.     The external appearance of the storage compartment 2 may be defined by an inner case 10, which is provided inside the cabinet 1. The inner case 10 may include a top wall 12 and a bottom wall 14, which form the inner surface of the storage compartment 2. The front side of the storage compartment 2 may be open, so as to allow a user to access the storage compartment 2 through the front side of the storage compartment 2.     The cabinet 1 is provided at the front side thereof with a first door 20 and a second door 40. The first door 20 is pivotably installed to the cabinet 1 and serves to open or close one side of the storage compartment 2, and the second door 40 is pivotably installed to the cabinet 1 and serves to open or close a remaining side of the storage compartment 2. Here, the storage compartment 2 may be wholly closed when both the first door 20 and the second door 40 close the front side of the storage compartment 2.     The second door 40 may be provided with a pillar 100, which is rotated so as to come into contact with the first door 20. The pillar 100 may generally have a rectangular shape and may be coupled to the second door 40 so as to be rotatable relative to the second door 40.     The pillar 100 has a shorter length than the distance between the top wall 12 and the bottom wall 14 of the inner case 10, so as not to come into contact with the top wall 12 and the bottom wall 14. That is, even if the second door 40 is rotated and closes the storage compartment 2, the pillar 100 does not come into contact with both the top wall 12 and the bottom wall 14. Each of the top wall 12 and the bottom wall 14 may define a single plane owing to the structural shape of the inner case 10, i.e. because no constituent element configured to limit the rotation of the pillar 100 is arranged on the top wall 12 or the bottom wall 14.     The first door 20 may have a door dike 22, which defines the external appearance of the rear side of the first door 20. In addition, the second door 40 may have a door dike 42, which defines the external appearance of the rear side of the second door 40.     Baskets 44 and 24 may be installed to the respective door dikes 42 and 22 and may be configured to store various shapes of food therein. Here, in the case of the basket 24, which is provided at the first door 20, which is not provided with the pillar 100, the corner thereof may have an angular shape because the basket 24 does not interfere with the pillar 100 when the first door 20 is rotated. Therefore, the amount of food to be stored in the basket 24 may be increased compared to the case where the basket 24 has a rounded corner.     The storage compartment 2 may include a first drawer 34 located on the side of the first door 20 and a second drawer 32 located on the side of the second door 40. Here, the first drawer 34 and the second drawer 32 may be disposed in the same horizontal plane. That is, the first drawer 34 and the second drawer 32 may be arranged on the left and right sides respectively at the same height within the storage compartment 2. The first drawer 34 and the second drawer 32 may be pulled outward independently of each other.     The first drawer 34 and the second drawer 32 may have the same width. That is, the first drawer 34 and the second drawer 32 may have the same storage capacity, and may be replaced with each other. When the first drawer 34 and the second drawer 32 have different widths, and thus have different shapes, the two drawers need to be differently fabricated, which may increase manufacturing costs. On the other hand, when the two drawers have the same shape, this is advantageous in terms of a reduction in manufacturing costs.     In the embodiment of the present invention, the function described above may be implemented because the pillar 100 is not located in the path along which the first drawer 34 is pulled outward when the first door 20 is opened and the first drawer 34 is pulled outward in the state in which the second door 40 closes the storage compartment 2. The reason why the pillar 100 is not located in the path will be described later with reference to other drawings.     Meanwhile, in the embodiment of the present invention, the first door 20 and the second door 40 may be the same width. Thus, the first door 20 and the second door 40 may share some of the production processes thereof, which may reduce the production costs of the doors. The reason for this will be described later with reference to other drawings.     In particular, no constituent elements for operating the pillar 100 are provided on the top wall 12 or on the bottom wall 14 of the inner case 10. As such, because the pillar 100 may extend lengthwise between the top wall 12 and the bottom wall 14, the contact area between the first door 20, the second door 40, and the pillar 100 may be increased. Because the pillar 100 has an increased length compared to the related art, the efficiency with which the storage compartment 2 is hermetically sealed by the pillar 100 may be improved. Accordingly, the inner case 10 is not provided with any inwardly protruding parts, which may prevent sanitary problems caused when impurities such as, for example, food or dust, become adhered to the protruding parts.     In the present embodiment, a first link device 200 is provided at the outside of the storage compartment 2 and is configured to be operated in contact with the first door 20 and the second door 40 at the top of the cabinet 1.     The first link device 200 may include a housing 210, which defines the external appearance of the first link device 200, and a first bar 220 and a second bar 230, which are pushed into or pulled out of the housing 210. The housing 210 may be coupled to the top of the cabinet 1 so as to be pushed by coming into contact with corner portions of the first door 20 and the second door 40.     At this time, because the housing 210 is separated from the storage compartment 2, rather than being connected thereto, cold air supplied to the storage compartment 2 does not move into the housing 210. Thus, the housing 210 does not need to be thermally insulated using an insulating material, or does not need to have a hermetically sealed configuration in order to prevent cold air from moving outward. That is, the housing 210 is a structure that is located outside of the storage compartment 2, which is closed by the first door 20 and the second door 40.     The internal configuration of the storage compartment 2 is not complicated by the housing 210 because the housing 210 is not installed inside the storage compartment 2. Thus, it is possible to prevent impurities such as, for example, food from being jammed inside the storage compartment 2.     In addition, because the housing 210 is installed outside of the cabinet 1, constituent elements thereof may be easily replaced by an operator in the case of failures thereof.     In addition, the second door 40 may be provided with a second link device 300, which is operated by the first link device 200 and serves to rotate the pillar 100. Here, one side of the second link device 300 may be partially exposed from a corner portion of the second door 40, and thus may be pushed by the second bar 230. Meanwhile, the other side of the second link device 300 may be connected to the pillar 100 so as to allow the pillar 100 to be rotated according to the operation of the second bar 230.     FIG. 2 is a view illustrating the closed state of the first door and the second door in accordance with the embodiment, FIG. 3 is a view illustrating the state of the pillar in FIG. 2, FIG. 4 is a view illustrating major components of FIG. 3, and FIG. 5 is a view illustrating the rotation of the pillar.     As illustrated in FIGs. 2 and 3, the first link device 200 may include the first bar 220, which is pushed by the first door 20, the second bar 230, which is pushed by the second door 40, and a rotation gear 240 rotatably engaged between the first bar 220 and the second bar 230.     That is, the first bar 220 and the second bar 230 are movably coupled to teeth of the rotation gear 240 interposed therebetween. As such, when any one of the first bar 220 and the second bar 230 is moved in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1, the other one of the first bar 220 and the second bar 230 is moved in the forward direction of the cabinet 1.     The first bar 220 and the second bar 230 have accommodation regions 222 and 234 respectively, in which part of the rotation gear 240 is accommodated. The rotation gear 240 may be placed in the accommodation regions 222 and 234 so as to overlap the first bar 220 and the second bar 230 respectively. As such, the space in which the first bar 220, the second bar 230, and the rotation gear 240 are installed may be reduced because the first bar 220, the second bar 230, and the rotation gear 240 overlap each other.     In addition, the coupling force between the first bar 220, the second bar 230, and the rotation gear 240 may be increased because the top and bottom of the rotation gear 240 are surrounded by the top and bottom surfaces of the accommodation regions 222 and 234.     As exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 3, the first bar 220 and the second bar 230 are located lower than the maximum height of the first door 20 and the second door 40. This is because the first bar 220 and the second bar 230 need to be pushed by the firstdoor 20 and the second door 40 respectively. Meanwhile, the first bar 220 and the second bar 230 are installed in the space into which no cold air is supplied from the storage compartment 2.     The second link device 300 includes a first link member 310, which is pushed and operated by the first link device 200, a second link member 330, which is configured to rotate the pillar 100, and a transmission member 380, which transmits the operation of the first link member 310 to the second link member 330.     The second link device 300 includes an elastic member 370, which elastically supports the first link member 310 so that the first link member 310 is moved in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1 when external force applied to the first link member 310 is removed. At this time, the first link member 310 may be inserted into a guide groove, and the elastic member 370 may be provided in one end of the guide groove.     When the first link member 310 is moved in the forward direction of the cabinet 1, the elastic member 370 is compressed. On the other hand, when the first link member 310 is moved in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1, the elastic member 370 may be tensioned.     At this time, the first link member 310 and the second link member 330 may be installed at different heights.     The transmission member 380 may include a first rotator 382, which is engaged with and rotated by the first link member 310, a second rotator 390, which is engaged with and rotated by the second link member 330, and a connection bar 386, which connects the first rotator 382 and the second rotator 390 to each other.     The first rotator 382 and the second rotator 390 may take the form of rotation gears having teeth, and the connection bar 386 may connect rotating shafts of the first rotator 382 and the second rotator 390 to each other so that the rotation of the first rotator 382 is transmitted to the second rotator 390. In particular, as the first rotator 382 and the second rotator 390 are engaged with the connection bar 386 without the risk of spinning within no traction, the rotation of the first rotator 382 may be directly transmitted to the second rotator 390.     Accordingly, when any one of the first link member 310 and the second link member 330 is moved in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1, the other one of the first link member 310 and the second link member 330 may be moved in the forward direction of the cabinet 1.     Meanwhile, the connection bar 386 vertically extends so that the first rotator 382 and the second rotator 390 are installed at different heights. As such, the first rotator 382 is located higher than the second rotator 390, and the first link member 310 is located higher than the second link member 330.     The first rotator 382 may be located outside a region defined by a gasket 46, which is located between the second door 40 and the cabinet 1, and the second rotator 390 may be located inside the region defined by the gasket 46 located between the second door 40 and the cabinet 1.     The gasket 46 comes into contact with the pillar 100 or the cabinet 1 so as to allow the storage compartment 2 to be hermetically sealed when the first door 20 and the second door 40 close the storage compartment 2. The gasket 46 is disposed in a rectangular form along the peripheral contour of the corners of the second door 40. As such, the inside of a rectangle and the outside of the rectangle may be partitioned from each other by the gasket 46. The inside of the rectangle, defined by the gasket 46, may mean the space in the storage compartment 2 in which cold air is distributed.     The first link member 310 and the second link member 330 may be arranged to overlap each other when viewed from the top side because the first rotator 382 and the second rotator 390 may have a height difference therebetween owing to the connection bar 386. As such, the front-and-rear space required to install the first link member 310 and the second link member 330 may be reduced. In addition, the thickness of the insulating material of the second door 40 may be reduced because the first link member 310 and the second link member 330 are installed so as to overlap each other.     The first link member 310 may have teeth corresponding to the teeth of the first rotator 382 so as to be engaged with the first rotator 382.     As exemplarily illustrated in FIGs. 4 and 5, the second link member 330 may include a first connector 340, which is engaged with and moved by the transmission member 380, and a second connector 350, which is rotatably connected at one end thereof to the first connector 340 and is also rotatably connected at a remaining end thereof to the pillar 100.     The first connector 340 may include a first extending portion 342, which extends in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1, and a second extending portion 344, which extends toward the first door 20 at a prescribed angle in relation to the first extending portion 342. Each of the first extending portion 342 and the second extending portion 344 takes the form of an elongated bar. The first extending portion 342 and the second extending portion 344 constitute a single member so as not to move relative to each other and to maintain a prescribed angle therebetween.     Owing to the configuration in which the first extending portion 342 and the second extending portion 344 are arranged at a prescribed angle, the pillar 100 may be easily rotated by force transmitted from the first link member 310. Assuming that the first link member 310 is shaped to extend only in the longitudinal direction thereof, it is difficult to cause the pillar 100 to be rotated by the first link member 310.     The second connector 350 may include a first connecting portion 352, which is connected to the second extending portion 344, and a second connecting portion 354, which is bent from the first connecting portion 352 at a prescribed angle. Each of the first connecting portion 352 and the second connecting portion 354 takes the form of an elongated bar. The first connecting portion 352 and the second connecting portion 354 constitute a single member so as not to move relative to each other and to maintain a prescribed angle therebetween.     At this time, the first connecting portion 352 may be longer than the second connecting portion 354. The pillar 100 may attain a path for easy rotation thereof because the first connecting portion 352 is longer than the second connecting portion 354.     Owing to the configuration in which the first connecting portion 352 and the second connecting portion 354 are arranged at a prescribed angle, the second link member 330 may be operated without interference from other members of the refrigerator. The coupling portion of the second link member 330 and the pillar 100 needs to be rotated in order to ensure that the second link member 330 rotates the pillar 100. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the technical problem whereby interference from other members may occur.     As exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 5, when the first connector 340 is moved in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1 (i.e. in the upward direction in FIG. 5), the first extending portion 342 and the second extending portion 344 are moved together in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1.     That is, the first connector 340 is linearly moved in the forward direction or in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1. Through this linear movement of the first connector 340, the distance between the second extending portion 344 and the first door 20 is equally maintained. On the other hand, when the first connector 340 is linearly moved, the second extending portion 344 is moved away from the second door 40.     At this time, the first connecting portion 352, which is connected to the second extending portion 344, is linearly moved in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1 by the same distance as the linear movement of the second extending portion 344. That is, when the first connector 340 is linearly moved, the connection portion of the first connecting portion 352 and the second extending portion 344 is linearly moved.     On the other hand, when the first connector 340 is linearly moved, the connection portion of the second connecting portion 354 and the pillar 100 is rotated. In addition, the pillar 100 is rotated about the rotation axis thereof because the connection portion of the second connecting portion 354 and the pillar 100 is rotatable. The pillar 100 may be rotatably provided on a pillar coupling portion 48, which is provided at one side of the door dike 42. As such, the pillar coupling portion 48 may provide the axis of rotation of the pillar 100, and the rotation of the pillar 100 about the axis of rotation may be guided such that the connection portion of the second connecting portion 354 and the pillar 100 is located far away from the axis of rotation.     At this time, the second connecting portion 354 is rotated in the same direction as the pillar 100.     When the first connector 340 is linearly moved, the second connector 350 simultaneously performs linear movement and rotation. Therefore, the pillar 100 may be rotated when the first connector 340 is linearly moved.     The state in which the storage compartment 2 is closed by the first door 20 and the second door 40 will be described below with reference to FIGs. 2 and 3.     In the state in which both the first door 20 and the second door 40 close the storage compartment 2, the first door 20 pushes the first bar 220 and the second door 40 pushes the second bar 230.     At this time, the first door 20, which pushes the first bar 220, is not easily deformed, and therefore pushes the first bar 220 with relatively strong force.     On the other hand, in relation to the second door 40, the second bar 230 is pushed by the first link member 310 installed to the second door 40, rather than the second door 40. Because one end of the second bar 230 is supported by the elastic member 370, the elastic member 370 may be compressed.     Because the first bar 220 is pushed by the first door 20 and the second bar 230 is moved in the forward direction of the cabinet 1 as the rotation gear 240 is rotated, the first link member 310 is moved in the forward direction of the cabinet 1 while compressing the elastic member 370.     Meanwhile, as the first link member 310 is moved in the forward direction of the cabinet 1, the first link member 310 may rotate the first rotator 382. At this time, the second rotator 390, which is connected to the first rotator 382 via the connection bar 386, is also rotated.     Accordingly, the second link member 330, which is engaged with the second rotator 390, may be moved in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1. Thereby, because the first connector 340 and the second connector 350 are moved rearward, the pillar 100 may be unfolded so as to come into contact with the first door 20 and the second door 40 as exemplarily illustrated in FIG. 3.     FIG. 6 is a view illustrating the open state of the first door in accordance with the embodiment, and FIG. 7 is a view illustrating the state of the pillar in FIG. 6.     Referring to FIGs. 6 and 7, the second door 40 closes the storage compartment 2 and the first door 20 opens the storage compartment 2.     At this time, the pillar 100 is in the folded state, rather than being unfolded toward the first door 20. Thus, the pillar 100 is not located in the movement path of the drawer located on the side of the first door 20 when the drawer is pulled outward. Accordingly, because the pillar 100 does not cover the drawer located on the side of the first door 20 when the drawer is pulled outward, the drawer located on the side of the first door 20 may have an increased width.     In addition, the basket provided on the rear side of the first door 20 may have an angular shape. This is because, although the basket located on the rear side of the first door 20 may catch on the pillar 100 when the first door 20 is rotated, in the present embodiment, the pillar 100 is not located in the path along which the basket located on the rear side of the first door 20 is rotated, but is folded toward the second door 40. Accordingly, the basket located on the rear side of the first door 20 may have an increased storage capacity.     The first door 20 does not push the first bar 220. Thus, the first link member 310 is moved in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1 because the elastic member 370 provided at the first link member 310 tends to return to its original shape.     The first link member 310 moves the second bar 230 in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1, and the first bar 220 is moved in the forward direction of the cabinet 1 by the rotation gear 240.     Because the first link member 310 is moved in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1, the first rotator 382 is rotated counterclockwise, and the second rotator 390 is also rotated counterclockwise. As such, as the second link member 330 is moved in the forward direction of the cabinet 1, the second link member 330 pulls the pillar 100 in the forward direction of the cabinet 1, whereby the pillar 100 may be rotated so as to be folded.     Meanwhile, to allow the second door 40 to continuously close the storage compartment 2 while coming into contact with the cabinet 1, the restoration force of the elastic member 370 may be smaller than the restoration force by which the contact between the second door 40 and the cabinet 1 is released. The reason for this is that, when the restoration force (tension) of the elastic member 370 is too great to keep the second door 40 adjacent to the cabinet 1, the second door 40 may not be kept in contact with the cabinet 1, and the storage compartment 2 may not be closed by the second door 40.     FIG. 8 is a view illustrating the open state of the second door in accordance with the embodiment, and FIG. 9 is a view illustrating the state of the pillar in FIG. 8.     Referring to FIGs. 8 and 9, to allow the second door 40 to be opened in the state in which the first door 20 closes the storage compartment 2, the pillar 100 needs to be in the folded state. Otherwise, the pillar 100 may be caught by the first door 20, thus preventing the second door 40 from being opened.     At this time, when the second door 40 is rotated, the first link member 310 may be moved in the rearward direction of the cabinet 1 by the elastic member 370 because there is no constituent element, such as the second bar 230 that pushes the first link member 310.     Accordingly, the pillar 100 may be folded according to the same principle illustrated in FIGs. 6 and 7. Thus, a detailed description of the related content will be omitted hereinafter.     FIG. 10 is a view illustrating a rotation assistance device to assist the rotation of the pillar.     When the first door 20 and the second door 40 close the storage compartment 2, the pillar 100 needs to come into contact with the first door 20 and the second door 40, in order to keep the storage compartment 2 hermetically sealed. In addition, when the pillar 100 is pushed toward the first door 20 and the second door 40 as force is continuously transmitted to the pillar 100 in a given direction, the pillar 100 has a reduced risk of generating noise owing to slight shaking of the first door 20 or the second door 40. Therefore, the pillar 100 may continuously receive force in the direction in which the pillar 100 is unfolded while being unfolded.     In the present embodiment, the rotation assistance device may be installed to a rotating shaft about which the pillar 100 is rotated. The rotation assistance device serves to assist the pillar 100 in being rotated to the unfolded state thereof. To this end, the rotation assistance device is adapted to continuously apply force to the pillar 100 such that the pillar 100 is moved to the unfolded state thereof.     In addition, in the state in which any one of the first door 20 and the second door 40 is rotated in order to open the storage compartment 2, the pillar 100 needs to be kept folded. At this time, the force by which the pillar 100 is folded needs to be continuously applied to the pillar 100, which prevents the generation of vibrations or noise caused when the second door 40 is rotated.     In the present embodiment, the rotation assistance device, designated by reference numeral 400, provides a configuration to keep the pillar 100 folded.     The rotation assistance device 400 includes a first cam 410, which is supported by an elastic member and is rotated along with the pillar 100, and a second cam 430, which is engaged with the first cam 410.     The second cam 430 has a first slope 423 formed on one side of an upwardly facing surface thereof, and a second slope 434 at the opposite side of the first slope 423.     At this time, the first slope 432 and the second slope 434 may abut each other, and the contact portion of the first slope 432 and the second slope 434 may protrude upward further than the remaining portion. That is, the overall shape of the first slope 432 and the second slope 434 may resemble a mountain.     In addition, the first cam 410 is formed with a protrusion 412, which is configured to come into contact with the first slope 432 or the second slope 434 so that the movement of the protrusion 412 is guided by the first slope 432 or the second slope 434. At this time, the protrusion 412 may be generally shaped such that the central portion thereof protrudes downward and such that the height thereof gradually increases at opposite ends thereof.     The first cam 410 may be coupled to the pillar 100 so as to rotate in the same manner as the pillar 100 without the risk of spinning with no traction.     Accordingly, in the case where the protrusion 412 is present between the first slope 432 and the second slope 434, the protrusion 412 is guided along the first slope 432 or the second slope 434, thus guiding the rotation of the pillar 100.     With the rotation assistance device 400, the pillar 100 continuously receives force in the direction in which the pillar 100 is unfolded toward the first door 20 and the second door 40, or in the direction in which the pillar 100 is folded.     Meanwhile, when external force is applied to rotate the pillar 100, the protrusion 412 of the first cam 410 may be moved along any one of the first slope 432 and the second slope 434 of the second cam 430.     That is, when external force is applied to rotate the pillar 100, an elastic member 420 may be temporarily compressed because the protrusion 412 is moved along the first slope 432 or the second slope 434. Thereby, the first cam 410 may be moved upward so as to become far away from the second cam 430.     When the protrusion 412 is rotated so as to become closer to either one of the adjacent portions of the first slope 432 and the second slope 434 than to the other one, the protrusion 412 is moved downward along the first slope 432 or the second slope 434.     That is, the pillar 100 is rotated when the protrusion 412 is rotated along the first slope 432 or the second slope 434. The pillar 100 may receive supplementary rotation force from the elastic member 420, which elastically supports the pillar 100.     In addition, once the protrusion 412 has been sufficiently guided along the first slope 432 or has been sufficiently guided along the second slope 434, the pillar 100 is no longer rotated unless external force sufficient to compress the elastic member 420 is applied.     Accordingly, the pillar 100 may be kept folded or unfolded by the rotation assistance device 400.     In particular, in the state in which the first door 20 is closed and only the second door 40 is opened, the second bar 230 does not push the second link device 300. The elastic member 370 is tensioned to the original state thereof as the external force applied thereto is removed. At this time, the elastic member 370 compresses part of the elastic member 420 while returning to the original state thereof, thereby changing the pillar 100 into the folded state. That is, the force required to tension the elastic member 370 from the compressed state to the original state may be greater than the force required to compress the elastic member 420.     Likewise, in the state in which the second door 40 is closed and only the first door 20 is opened, the second bar 230 does not push the second link device 300 with sufficient force. This is because the first bar 220 cannot prevent the movement of the second bar 230 because there is no constituent element for preventing the movement of the first bar 220. The elastic member 370 is tensioned to the original state thereof because no sufficient external force is applied to the elastic member 370. At this time, the elastic member 370 compresses part of the elastic member 420 while returning to the original state thereof, thereby changing the pillar 100 to the folded state. That is, the force required to tension the elastic member 370 from the compressed state to the original state may be greater than force required to compress the elastic member 420.     The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, various other alterations of the embodiments are possible by those skilled in the part as can be appreciated from the accompanying claims, and these alterations fall within the scope of the present invention.     As described above, a related description has sufficiently been discussed in the above Best Mode for implementation of the present invention.     As described above, the present invention may be wholly or partially applied to a refrigerator.

The milk derived, denatured rentate allows the formation of microbubbles in an aerated skimmed milk composition, and thus retains certain desirable sensory perception characteristics such as a good mouthfeel and perceived thickness.","MILK BASED COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING MILK DERIVED, DENATURED RETENTATE     TECHNICAL FIELD     The present invention relates to an improved beverage and method of manufacture.     5 More specifically the invention is directed towards a dairy-based beverage which retains certain desirable sensory perception characteristics such as a good mouthfeel and perceived thickness.     BACKGROUND ART     There is a commercial benefit to providing many beverages, and in many cases foods, 10 which have desirable sensory characteristics, such as flavour, mouthfeel, texture,     smoothness/creaminess, and overall indulgency.     Often this is achieved by ensuring a high amount of fat content is present in the beverage, which generally provides all of these characteristics. A good example of this are thick- shakes as produced by fast-food outlets such as Wendy's, McDonalds and so forth, 15 which will have thick-shakes with a fat content significantly higher than say standard     market milk (3.3% fat), sometimes in the order of up to 9% or more. The products are certainly desirable from an indulgency perspective.     Yet given the high fat and high calorie content in these beverages, they can be disadvantageous from a health perspective, as both a high calorie and high cholesterol diet 20 are associated with a range of health issues such as obesity and heart disease. There is a definite need and desire from the public for beverages that retain these desirable sensory characteristics, yet are also healthier.     An important characteristic of thick-shakes is bubbles/froth, which is created by adding ice-cream. This froth has a positive impact on mouthfeel. However the addition of ice- 25 cream not only increases the concentration of fat but also has other negative impacts - firstly, it's not available everywhere and secondly it contains various non-dairy ingredients such as emulsifiers.     An alternative to thick-shakes are milkshakes which lack ice-cream and subsequently have a lower fat content. However a disadvantage of milkshakes is a loss of sensory 30 characteristics, particularly the indulgent mouthfeel provided by a high fat beverage. In attempt to address these problems, various products and/or methods have been developed.     For example, NZ 563869 is directed towards using hydrophobin proteins and a surfactant to better retain gas bubbles within food products to improve the texture. NZ 587796 is directed towards using alternan (polysaccharides made up of glucose units) as a thickening agent for various foodstuffs or beverages. Even within this document, there is reference to many thickening agents such as starch, gums, and so forth that are well known as conventional thickening agents to improve overall mouthfeel of a product without resorting to, in some cases, increased fat content. NZ 552132 discloses an acidic milk drink that has a low fat, low calorie acidic milk drink yet with achieving a good flavour and light texture. It relies on inclusion of polydextrose and sugar.     In another example, US 2007/0065555 discloses a stabilised dairy foam which includes milk, a surfactant, a polysaccharide and a polymer. In NZ 564378, methods of preparing frothy milk based beverages such as cappuccinos are described, including conventional techniques such as applying pressure and heat to produce bubble formation.     In other examples such as US 2011/0244076, CN 101156629B and WO 1996/033618, carbonation techniques are described in milk-based beverages for a number of reasons. However, these processes require pressurized gas (typically C02or N) which has a number of disadvantages.     First, carbonation requires specialized techniques and equipment, such that the beverage cannot be made conveniently like using mechanical aeration techniques. Second, in the context of milk based products, the fizzy texture from carbonation is not what many users are used to nor desire - such that carbonation is more often not only applied to non-dairy based soft drinks. Third, and again in the context of milk based products, the pH of the milk-based product decreases once carbonated, and this can lead to undesired stability issues with beverages such as coffee, which already lowers the pH somewhat.     These documents exemplify the need and the lengths to which the industry has gone to develop substitutes which provide good sensory characteristics without resorting to high fat products. However, the main disadvantages of such products include:     Resorting to exogenous components such as gum or hydro-colloidal components (i.e. exogenous non-dairy components) to achieve the sensory characteristics, and/or improved volume retention. This is undesirable from a public perspective. The public prefers to have a product with a minimal amount (or none) of exogenous additives.     Some of the added components may lead to a displeasing flavour or texture, despite improving the viscosity and/or bubble retention.     The components may inconveniently lead to added manufacturing costs, complicated processing, or difficulty in its use.     Despite aiming to achieve good bubble formation in cases such as US     2007/0065555 or IMZ 564378, the persistency of the bubbles may be poor, meaning that the end user may only have a short period to consume their beverage before the mouthfeel subsides. - In cases such as NZ 564378, the methodology and products may be overly     complicated, inconsistent, and/or only be applicable to hot drinks. It would be beneficial to have a product that is easy to prepare and is applicable towards cold and hot beverages.     It is an objective of the present invention to address the foregoing problems or at least to provide the public with a useful choice.

Throughout this specification, the word ""comprise"", or variations thereof such as ""comprises"" or ""comprising"", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.     Further aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description which is given by way of example only. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION     Previously, the same Applicant developed a novel composition for producing aerated beverages which has excellent sensory perception results. Unlike the prior art described herein, it avoided use of high fat levels and using exogenous foreign excipients to achieve the beneficial mouth feel, look and taste following aeration. The previous invention was based on the use of recombined milk which had much lower levels of fat (about 1.5 to 5% w/w), yet surprisingly showed excellent sensory perception results. Using recombined milk (preferably with a heat denatured retentate added), it was shown that the sensory results were considerably better than standard 3.5% w/w fat milk, and were even comparable to 9% w/w fat thick-shakes. This represented a considerable breakthrough in the commercial field of frothy beverages, as it provided a low fat, and a more ""natural"" option for many hot and cold frothy beverages easily through simple aeration of the composition (not carbonation), yet still provided the commercially important sensory perception requirements.     According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a milk-based composition including a skimmed milk source characterised in that the composition includes: less than about 0.5% w/w fat; and a milk-derived, denatured retentate.     According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a milk- based composition including a skimmed milk source characterised in that the composition includes: less than about 0.5% w/w fat; and a milk-derived, denatured retentate; and wherein the ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein in the composition is in the range of between about 10:90 to 90:10.     According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided an aerated beverage characterised in that the aerated beverage includes: a skimmed milk source; less than about 0.5% w/w fat; and a milk-derived, denatured retentate.     According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided an non-aerated beverage characterised in that the non-aerated beverage includes: a skimmed milk source; less than about 0.5% w/w fat; and a milk-derived, denatured retentate. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a use of a milk-derived, denatured retentate to create a non-aerated or aerated milk-based composition or beverage with less than about 0.5% w/w fat.     According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of denaturing a milk derived, retentate for use in a milk based composition as described herein characterised by the steps of a) denaturing the milk derived retentate at about 60-95C for a duration of about 5- 120 minutes prior to adding the denatured retentate to a skimmed milk source to produce the composition. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing a milk-based composition as described herein characterised by the step of a) combining a skimmed milk source with a milk derived, denatured retentate; b) optionally increasing solid content to between about 9 to 12 % w/w; c) optional further downstream processing selected from the group consisting of homogenization, pasteurization and/or UHT treatment; and d) optional aeration prior to consumption.     In the present application and as a result of ongoing research and development, the same inventors produced a significantly improved composition which has further commercial advantages. Once the composition has been aerated, the composition displays beneficial stable micro-bubbles, providing a rich mouth feel. These features were surprisingly retained when the fat component (previously from recombined milk) was removed, and the composition simply relied upon a skimmed milk source, and a milk derived, denatured retentate. Without denaturing the retentate, the micro-bubbles did not form, and the beneficial results were not observed.     As a result, the new composition's fat content was kept at essentially zero (about 0.2% w/w) and still showed remarkable foaming and sensory perception results. This is a significant and unexpected result as the composition is substantially devoid of any fat, which was thought to be needed to contribute significantly to the desired characteristics, in terms of viscosity, mouth feel and stability.     Additionally, the inventors surprisingly identified that the combination of the skimmed milk and milk-derived, denatured retentate actually provides an improved mouthfeel as an non-aerated beverage compared to Calci-trim (having similar fat (0.2% w/w) and protein levels to the preferred composition) and even Light Blue having a higher fat content of about 1.5% fat. Therefore, the present invention has applicability not only as an aerated beverage, but also as a non-aerated low fat milk based beverage with improved mouthfeel.     Taking a step further, the inventors then identified a significant phenomenon, in that if the ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein in the composition is in the range of between about 30:70 and 70:30, the beneficial results (foam volume and foam quality (i.e. micro- foam), which gives the mouth feel are particularly well pronounced, as will be illustrated further in this specification. The denatured protein may typically be provided by the denatured retentate, and the un-denatured protein may be provided by the skimmed milk source (or other component, as discussed further below).     The avoidance of fat is beneficial because:     It is healthier than the high fat alternatives, or even the lower fat option previously invented by the Applicant which typically used 1-5% fat content (unpublished);     Milk containing fat may have long term shelf-life issues;     Fat addition, either in the process of using recombined milk, or other sources, may be expensive and cumbersome.     The use of the denatured retentate appears to be a key in converting an otherwise unstable system such as aerated skimmed milk into a composition that produces very stable, velvety foams.     Other milk based compositions such as those described in WO 2012/110705, WO     2013/004895 and WO 2012/056106, which are used for different applications such as low lactose milk or whey protein products, include milk derived ultra filtrate retentates.     However, any heat treatment which has been in processing these compositions are performed under different conditions due to their different purpose (i.e. simply to sterilise the final composition, or to pre-treat the raw milk to develop certain characteristics, not the isolated retentate itself).     Like the previous composition developed by the Applicant, it requires only dairy based constituents and therefore provides good customer acceptance, negates the need for high fat, and is easy to store and ultimately use.     It should also be appreciated that the inventors of the present invention are all food scientists with established track records in the industry. One co-inventor in particular is not only a food scientist, but has worked with and processed milk for a number of years in India and also New Zealand.     Further advantages of the present invention and its preferred features will become apparent with the ensuing description. Preferred Embodiments     Throughout the specification, the term ""aerated"" or variations thereof should be taken as meaning a beverage which has been adapted, developed, or prepared to include air or gas bubbles (i.e. typically, although not solely, atmospheric air) dispersed homogenously within, or just within a portion of, the beverage for a period of time.     In a liquid, the term ""non-aerated"" used throughout this specification should be taken as meaning a composition or beverage that has not been manipulated to include a higher than normal level of air or gas bubbles. Of course, most compositions or beverage will have some underlying natural level of dissolved gas or air trapped within it, and the term ""non-aerated"" is intended to encompass this.     It should be appreciated that the term aeration should not be confused with the well known process of carbonation, the latter which utilises gas (C02) under pressure to create bubbles. Aeration, on the other hand, requires mechanical energy to help create the bubbles. The use of composition according to the present invention helps to produce such bubbles under mechanical aeration, improve stability and provide a number of other benefits which will be discussed throughout this specification.     Therefore according to one aspect of the present invention of forming an aerated beverage does not correspond to previously known carbonation techniques. However, it should be appreciated that the present invention could also be used with carbonated beverages if so desired. In many aspects of the present invention, carbonation is seen to be disadvantageous as it lowers the pH of neutral milk. In one example, coffee lowers the pH of milk, so application of carbonation techniques would disadvantageously lower the pH further and result in stability issues which are avoided by the present invention.     Throughout this specification, the term ""bubbles"" should also be understood to encompass foam within or as part of a liquid, and so forth. Micro-foams are discussed throughout this specification, which are well known in the art to be distinct to macro- foams. Micro-foams can be advantageous over macro-foams as they provide a beneficial velvety foam, and are often linked to a good mouth feel and overall taste.     The composition may be provided as a powdered form, a solid form and/or as a liquid form (or combinations thereof). Throughout the specification, the term ""beverage"" should be taken as meaning any liquid fit for animal (typically human) internal consumption. Examples include, but are clearly not limited to, cold drinks such as milkshakes, thick-shakes, frozen beverages, smoothies, frappuccinos, or hot drinks such as hot chocolate, fluffies (frothy hot milk drinks for children), or coffee-based drinks, or a frothy portion thereof, such as mochaccinos, cappuccinos, and so forth.     The present invention may also be used for nutritional or medicinal based beverages, for instance to improve the flavour, texture and mouthfeel of either medicines or supplements or as a carrier of functional ingredients. In a further context of the invention, the term ""beverage"" should be understood to also encompass food and/or culinary products that have a liquid or semi-liquid based composition. For example, the present invention could be utilised for desserts which normally are heated or cooled in order to increased volume or overall mouthfeel before eating. Another example tested by the Applicant is quiche, where the composition was successfully used to replace cream. The present invention provides an alternative to such foods, where the volume (if aerated) or overall mouthfeel may be provided by the composition.     Throughout the specification, the term ""bubble retention"" should be referred to frequently and should be understood to mean the extent, duration and/or persistency of the increased volume of the beverage due to foam/air/gas entrapped within the beverage following aeration. An acceptable level of bubble retention will depend on the circumstance. However, in most cases a beverage is normally consumed within 20 minutes, so an acceptable duration would be approximately this timeframe or more. As will be seen in the examples, bubble duration is measured through total (liquid and foam) volume vs. time.     Throughout this specification, there is also frequent reference to sensory perception data. This sensory data was provided by a trained panel of 7-10 members, who evaluate dairy products year round. The panel has been trained for dairy sensory characteristics. For every attribute, they are provided with a guideline. For example, when assessing overall mouthfeel out of maximum score of 10, stiff creamy chocolate mousse would score a 9 for mouthfeel scale, a thick-shake (> 9% fat) would score a 7 and latte made out of regular market milk (3.3 % w/w fat) would score a 5. The panel proved to be very consistent in describing and scaling the various attributes. The sensory data covers froth volume (visually), mouthfeel (connected to froth type and stability), creaminess of the film, overall flavour and finally, the thickness/body of the beverage. These are all attributes that contribute to a beverage which is aimed at providing a drink with a feeling of indulgency, flavour and overall feel.     Milk     Throughout the specification the term ""milk based composition"" should be taken as meaning a mixture, either solid, semi-solid, or which includes milk-derived components. This would encompass a composition with dried skimmed milk powder, reconstituted skimmed milk, and/or skimmed milk.     The term ""milk"" should not be limited to milk from cows or goats, but should also encompass other milk sources such as buffalo, sheep, horses or camels for example.     Preferably, the composition only has milk-based components in it.     A goal of the project was to develop and market a composition to be used for aerated beverages, where the base composition only utilised milk-based components, for instance without relying on not high fat or exogenous thickeners. Not only is this advantageous from a public viewpoint as providing a more ""natural"" product, but it also avoids complicated processing techniques and increases in costs, and potential instability which might arise from combining multiple components that don't normally co-exist. However, optionally, the composition may be supplemented with other non-milk based additives such as flavourings if so desired. For example, the milk-based composition may be used to prepare flavoured compositions, such as ready to use coffee sachets.     Throughout this specification, the term ""skimmed milk source"" should be taken as meaning milk which has substantially all the fat (cream) has been removed from the whole milk. Although countries differ in the exact definition of fully skimmed milk, we herein define skimmed milk as having less than 0.3% w/w fat. This is comparable to semi- skimmed milk which typically has 1.5 - 1.7% w/w fat, and whole milk which typically has 3.3 - 4% w/w fat.     For clarity and comparison, recombined milk as used in the previous application, included a milk fat component, a non-fat milk component (often skimmed or partially defatted milk powder) and typically a fluid such as water. Most typically, the milk fat component is anhydrous milk fat, or freshly frozen milk-fat for recombining (FFMR), or butter, or ghee.     Fat content     A key and unexpected advantage is that, in using the combination of a skimmed milk source and the denatured milk-derived retentate (essentially without fat), the composition still shows advantageous sensory perception and bubble retention results compared to currently available full fat and low fat milk options.     Preferably, the composition has a fat content below 0.3% w/w. If using a standard skimmed milk of 0.3% w/w fat, the resulting composition may have less fat after dilution with other excipients.     More preferably, the composition has less than 0.25% fat.     Most preferably, the composition has about 0.2 % w/w fat or less.     The inventors have shown the composition works when using skimmed milk with 0.2 % w/w fat, which is essentially zero. It is fully expected that if one were to use a 0.0% fat skimmed milk powder, the same results would be seen in both aerated and non-aerated samples.     Sensory perception results showed that despite the lack of fat in the composition, overall mouthfeel, texture and taste did not suffer as a consequence. Both bubble retention and sensory perception characteristics are maintained, and simultaneously may provide a much healthier option due to the lack of fat content.     In comparison to the market control products (1.5% and 3.3% commercial pasteurized milk), the present invention showed a remarkable ability as a base to be used for preparing aerated beverages with good sensory characteristics and bubble retention.     Milk-based retentate The composition includes a milk-derived, denatured retentate. This retentate is a key to the invention, and its characteristics, advantages and preferred features will be discussed below.     In the case of aerated beverages, the denatured retentate is thought to be a key to enabling formation of micro-bubbles, and hence the rich mouth feel. Dry foams (or otherwise known as macro-foams) do not significantly contribute to a good mouth feel. Whereas micro-bubbles (also termed wet foam) do contribute significantly to a rich mouthfeel and are caused where the air and liquid phases are mixed together (not separated). Without the essential incorporation of the retentate (or for that matter the denaturation of the retentate), a dry foam is observed following aeration of the composition.     In the case of non-aerated beverages, the denatured retentate is also significantly contributing to the improved mouthfeel in comparison to controls.     Throughout the specification the term ""milk-derived retentate"" should be taken as meaning a retained portion (typically high in protein content) of a milk which does not pass through a cross flow membrane or filter, and therefore can be collected and used for a particular purpose. In the context of milk, retentates are well characterised and utilised<1>. The methodology for producing the retentate according to the present invention may rely on any such processes to prepare the retentate, although preferred features are discussed below which have been found to be particularly beneficial for the present invention.     A self-imposed preference of only using milk-based products made the task of providing a fat free composition with good foam characteristics significantly more difficult, as conventional approaches using non-dairy based ingredients were left aside (although it should be appreciated that the present invention could include non-dairy based ingredients).     The previous success of identifying and using recombined milk, preferably with a milk- derived retentate certainly offered many advantages. It is thought that the recombined milk based composition will be very successful as a base for aerated beverages for many reasons, for instance as it outperformed compositions using non-dairy based thickeners (carrageenan). However, the present invention offers a very commercially useful advantage distinct from using recombined milk, the latter which includes fat.     Preferably, the milk-based retentate is an ultra-filtrated retentate.     Ultra-filtration (UF) is a low pressure fractionation of selected milk components by molecular size. UF separates on the basis of molecular weight and the molecular weight Properties of Ultrafiltrated Skim Milk Retentate Powders, Journal of Dairy Science, Volume 69, Issue 2, Pages 329-339, February 986 cut off (MWCO) can range from about 1000 to 300,000. The portion of stream which passes through membrane is referred as permeate. The remainder of the stream, termed retentate, contains the solutes or suspended solids which have been rejected by the membrane. Depending on MWCO selected, the membrane will concentrate high molecular weight species while allowing dissolved salts and low molecular weight materials to pass.     UF membranes are used in numerous industries for concentration, clarification and diafiltration of large process streams. Goodman Fielder New Zealand's UF plant for retentate production uses a polyethersufone (PES) spiral wound membrane organized into three loops (modules) with MWCO of 30,000. This membrane is commonly used in dairy industry to concentrate whey and casein proteins, skim milk for various dairy applications such as milk standardization for cheese/yoghurt, and protein/calcium fortifications in milks/yoghurt.     The retentate of the present invention includes both whey protein and casein, which the inventors consider may be important to the results seen in the present invention. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors consider heat treatment of milks at or above 70C cause denaturation of whey proteins (-lactoglobulin), some of which may complex with casein micelles (involving K-casein) or can simply self aggregate to form polymeric products. The degree of interaction between -lg and K-casein might depend on the time and temperature of heating, concentrations of protein, pH and presence of salts.     Denatured whey proteins associated with casein micelle appear as appendages or filaments on the micellar surface in electron micrographs. These aggregates are thought to be responsible for an observed increase in viscosity, and potentially are the cause of the improved functional (such as foamability) and foam stability and sensorial properties observed in the present invention.     The retentate is denatured.     Throughout the specification, the term ""denatured"" should be taken as meaning that a substantial amount, or all of, the proteins within the milk-derived retentate have partially or fully lost their quaternary, tertiary or secondary structure which is present in their native state, as a result of an external stress or compound imposed on the retentate. There are numerous methods to achieve denaturation which should not be beyond the scope of the present invention. For example, heat denaturation, acid / base denaturation, use of organic solvents such as methanol and ethanol, cross-linking agents such as formaldehyde and/or radiation.     Preferably, the retentate is heat denatured.     Heat denatu ration is preferred as a denaturant because of its simplicity, and because it retains an over-riding commercial preference to not include exogenous (non-milk based) materials or non-food grade materials or processes. Heat denaturation will be discussed further below.     Preferably, the milk-derived retentate contributes at least 10% w/w of overall protein to the composition. The protein content composition can be important to achieve particularly optimal results, as is discussed further below. The use of the retentate beneficially also provides a substantial amount of protein to the composition and in this way further aids in the composition's advantages.     More preferably, the milk-derived, denatured retentate contributes approximately between 10 to 90 % w/w of the overall protein to the composition.     Even more preferably, the milk-derived, denatured retentate contributes approximately between 30 to 70% w/w of the overall protein to the composition.     Most preferably, the milk-derived, denatured retentate contributes approximately between 40 to 60% w/w of the overall protein to the composition. The inventors found that when the denatured retentate contributed more than about 70% w/w to the overall protein, then the final product became overly diluted and/or watery. This led to a loss of overall mouth feel.     As an example, a test product was prepared such that the retentate contributed 75% w/w of the total protein (4.3% w/w protein from the retentate out of a total of 5.7% w/w protein). Contrary to expectations, the sample was very watery and had a poor mouth feel. This may be due to low total solid content in the final product as retentate is devoid/low in lactose.     Oppositely, the inventors found that if the retentate contributes less than about 30% w/w to the overall protein in the composition, it is disadvantageous because as the protein level, particularly from the retentate lowers, the body and texture of the product, including bubble stability, diminishes substantially.     The beneficial were even more pronounced in the most preferred range of 40-60% w/w, and approximately 50% was seen as the most optimal amount. A further advantage of the retentate contributing more than 30% w/w of total protein is that the retentate may be richer in calcium. Therefore, the beverages according to the present invention may easily provide about 50% of RDI of calcium, assuming a serving size of 200 mL.     The studies performed thus far indicate the most beneficial results were present when the milk-base retentate contributes about 40-60 % w/w of the total protein in the     composition. Advantageously, this also corresponds to the approximate ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein ratio, as discussed below (denatured protein being provided by the heated retentate).     Protein level Preferably, the composition includes at least 1% w/w protein.     Preferably, the composition includes between 1 to 10% w/w protein, more preferably 3 to 8 % w/w, and most preferably 3.5 to 6 % w/w.     The minimum protein level tested thus far in the composition was 3.5% w/w, however it is reasonable to expect that this is not the minimum amount which still provides the desired effects. The most optimum protein level seen in initial trials was at 5.7% w/w as reflected in the results.     Increasing the protein content using heat denatured whey protein solution (instead of the retentate) did not improve the mouthfeel or bubble retention of the resulting aerated product. Therefore, this experiment showed whey protein as an alternative to the retentate was not effective, although as discussed below may be useful as an additive.     Beneficial results were observed when the ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein in the composition was configured between 10:90 and 90:10. For instance, within this range, foam stability of the composition was improved and overall flavour was also improved compared to samples with no denatured protein (i.e. normal blue top (3.3% fat) or light blue top milk (1.5% fat) samples)). Also, at the other end of the spectrum, a test sample with 100% denatured protein showed only minor improvements compared to the no denaturation sample, and showed poor taste. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate these results.     Preferably, the composition includes a ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein of approximately 30:70 to 70:30. More preferably, the composition includes a ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein of approximately 40:60 to 60:40.     Even more preferably, the composition includes a ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein of approximately 45:55 to 55:45.     Most preferably, the composition includes a ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein of approximately 50:50.     As shown in Figures 4 and 5, preliminary trials indicate the most beneficial results may be seen when between a ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein is configured at about 50:50, although alternate ratios still show lesser (albeit still beneficial) levels of foamability compared to samples with 0% denaturation (i.e. 1.5 % or 3.3 % fat milk) or a 100% denatured test sample.     Total solids     Total solids can be an important factor which may contribute to both viscosity and mouthfeel.     Preferably, the total solid content is configured to be between about 9.0 % w/w to about 12 % w/w.     Although the present invention provides the ability to retain a markedly improved result with essentially no fat, one issue faced by the inventor is that the ""no fat"" composition has slightly less total solids (about 1.5% w/w less) than the recombined milk variety as previously developed. To help circumvent this issue, the total solid level may be manipulated to achieve the desired level.     If the total solid level falls below about 9.0% w/w, gradual decreases in viscosity and mouth feel may be observed.     Alternatively, one disadvantage of increasing the total solid content beyond 12% w/w is that the calorific content will increase. More preferably, the total solid content is configured to be approximately 10.5% w/w.     For example, the total solid content may be increased to fall within the preferred range, by adding components such as whey powder (12.5% protein, 74.5% lactose, 0.9% fat), skimmed milk powder or lactose powder. Whey powder is preferred because it is cost effective and easier to handle than most other options.     To exemplify this beneficial effect, in preliminary trials, total foam volume was significantly improved when 1.5 % w/w whey powder was added to a composition containing skimmed milk and a heated retentate. This brought the total solid level from 9.5% w/w to 10.5 % w/w, and resulted in a product with better foamability and foam stability.     Phospholipid     Preferably, the composition is substantially void of phospholipid.     Without being bound by theory, it is thought that the phospholipids compete with milk proteins for the water-bubble (air) interface, which could cause bubble instability and collapse.     Method of manufacture of the composition     In the context of the present invention, it should be appreciated that method of manufacture of the composition can encompass at least the following scenarios (or combinations thereof): a) wherein the composition either forms the whole of, or a part of, a pre-prepared beverage well before the intended aeration and consumption (e.g. as a pre-made stored drink); b) wherein the composition is used on its own as the actual beverage (without addition to another beverage or liquid base) for subsequent aeration; and/or c) wherein the composition is provided as a base for subsequent preparation of an aerated beverage and consumption.     Taking these scenarios into account, the following preferred embodiments are discussed.     Preferably, the method includes agitating the composition in a liquid aerated beverage form to introduce entrapped bubbles into the beverage. The inventors have trialed two different whisking speeds (9000 rpm and 13000 rpm) for the test samples. It was surprisingly found that at both high and low speeds, the beneficial bubble formation, retention and sensory-perception results were substantially better than the market control product (1.5% fat commercial pasteurized milk). Even at low whisking speed (9000 rpm), which may more desirable from a usage perspective, the test samples was comparable to the Carrageenan test sample, (0.035% carrageenan added to baseline control product) and outperformed it on the grounds of overall mouthfeel and creaminess.     These results are significant, as it means the ease of use and reproducibility of the invention may be substantially better than compared to previous techniques to produce a frothy beverage. For example, in NZ 564378 it describes a complicated process of using pressure and temperature and then tries to manipulate and/or improve this process to improve the quality of froth/bubble formation in hot milk-based beverages. The current invention does not rely on pressure or steam in order to produce the beneficial results, and the longevity of the bubbles is also remarkably improved. Another significant advantage of the present invention is its versatility to both hot and cold (or intermediate temperature drinks). Many conventional drinks or processes such as that described in NZ 564378 are essentially limited to one or the other. Commercially, having a solution to the problems that satisfies both hot and cold beverage requirements is hugely beneficial. In one very useful embodiment, the invention is provided as a ready to drink (RTD) beverage that can be aerated by shaking before drinking in a bottle itself or in a closed container.     Method of manufacture of the denatured retentate     Preferably, the milk-based retentate is heat treated to denature (fully or partially) at least the some or all of the whey proteins.     It should be appreciated that denaturing a milk-based retentate is not a standard practice.     In trials, the inventors found that denaturing the proteins in the retentate substantially helped to increase viscosity of the resulting beverages, and in doing so further improved bubble retention. This treatment also was found to improve overall sensory perception results. Denaturing the retentate produced better results than use of un-denatured retentates. Additionally if whey protein alone is heated (without casein or other proteins), it did not give desired foamability characteristics.     Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors think heating the retentate according to the preferred conditions described herein causes the whey protein to denature. It is possible the whey protein, once denatured, binds to casein micelles (also in the retentate) and leads to different characteristics than seen with just heating a solution containing only the whey proteins. It may also be possible that the protein aggregate formed by heat treatment adsorb onto the bubble-water interface which in some way improves the bubble retention.     Heat treatment may be performed through numerous methods as described further below.     The method includes heating the milk-derived retentate completely separate to the skimmed milk in the composition. This supports the previous preferred embodiment regarding the ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein in the composition.     The retentate is heated between 60-95C for a duration of 5-120 minutes.     More preferably, the retentate is heated between 80-90C for a duration of 70-85 minutes.     Surprisingly, the foaming and/or mouthfeel characteristics of the beverage were significantly heightened when the latter conditions were used. For instance, if a lesser time / temperature parameters are used, decreased levels of denaturation may be observed, and the beneficial results may not be as pronounced.     These conditions suit an industrial setting where the retentate can be heated using a heat exchanger using the desired temperature in a short period of time. Then the heat can be maintained in an insulated temperature controlled environment.     Also, the time frame represents an industrial heating environment where the temperature is already raised to that level prior to heating.     Preferably, the milk-based retentate has been prepared through ultra-filtration. The advantages of using ultra-filtration methods include that no coagulation of protein occurs, it is a very common and easy process, it is non-erosive, requires no chemical treatment, uses existing capabilities of most plants, and is in liquid form.     Summary of the advantages of the present invention: - The desirable effects seen in the sensory perception trials is imparted by the bubble quality, and bubble retention are not reliant on any substantial fat or exogenous thickeners being required in the composition. Therefore, the indulgent, good mouthfeel may be provided without an unhealthy aspect to the drink, and may be considered naturally made; - The results may be achieved even when the product is fully derived from milk components, an important commercial advantage and focus of the applicant's invention. This reflects that in New Nutrition Business 2014 forecast, natural functionality is the number 1 predicted trend;     Comparable or improved bubble retention compared to positive market controls (e.g. 1.5% or 3.3% w/w fat pasteurized milk and the commercial formulation containing Carrageenan );     Similar or improved sensory perception compared to market controls (as above);     The method of use is very simple compared to prior art methods using techniques such as pressure and heat to froth milk. Commercially, this is a very important advantage.     The present invention may be used towards hot, ambient or cold temperature beverages. In the past, cold application has been particularly difficult. This innovation is considered to be particularly ground-breaking in relation to development of froth formation and retention in cold beverages but it may also be applied to either hot or ambient beverages and provide very beneficial results.     The resulting composition has beneficial advantages when used for a non-aerated beverage, as it shows improved mouthfeel compared to other low fat milk options. The resulting composition may undergo optional downstream processing without negative results being observed, including homogenization, pasteurization, or UHT treatment.     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Further aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the ensuing description which is given by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:     Figure 1 Sensory evaluation of pasteurized ""no fat"" milk according to the present invention following after whisking in a milkshake maker for 30 seconds Figure 2 Sensory evaluation of texture of pasteurized ""no fat"" milk according to the present invention as a non-aerated milk alternative.

The total solids (TS) equates to 10.5% w/w.     Example 2: Method of Preparing the Retentate     1. A skimmed milk sample was passed through an UF spiral membrane such as a polysulfone or ceramic filter.     2. The permeate is passed through the filter, containing the lactose. 3. The retentate is collected, and comprises the concentrated milk proteins.     4. The retentate is then heated at 85C for 80 minutes to allow denaturation. Example 3: Method of Manufacture of the composition     1. Skim milk and pre-heat treated UF retentate are mixed to form a first mixture.     The skim milk is pre-warmed to 65C prior to combination.     2. The whey powder is added and then mixed with the first mixture to form a second mixture.     3. This second mixture is pre-homogenized in a high shear mixer (such as a Silverson) or a high speed mixer for 2 min at 65-70C.     4. The pre-homogenized mixture is then homogenized at 65-70C in a 2-stage     homogenizer at 200/50 bar.     5. The homogenized mixture is then pasteurized at 74C for 15 seconds and filled in bottles. Alternatively, the mixture is UHT treated.     6. This milk may then be stored or used immediately for aeration purposes before consumption.     It should be appreciated that the beverage can be spray dried. For example, the drying method can be freeze drying, drum drying or tray drying.     Example 4: Method of aerating a beverage including the composition     1. Prior to consumption, the composition is made into a solution, if this has not already been done.     2. Aeration of a cold beverage is done by whisking the beverage by hand mixing or mechanical mixing at a speed of 1000-15000 rpm for approximately 10-120 seconds.     3. In another use, ready to drink (RTD) beverages can be prepared using the     composition and packed in bottles or carton after pasteurization/UHT/hot fill/Tunnel pasteurization. Preferably some headspace will be provided in the packaging. Shaking of the bottle/carton will create broth/bubble within the beverage, which will subsequently enhance the sensory characteristics.     It should be appreciated that although preliminary tests were performed with a cold beverage, it is expected that application of the present invention to hot beverages may be more common. The tests were performed on a cold beverage as foam stability was seen by the inventors as more of a potential technical issue compared to hotter conditions.     Example 5: Sensory evaluation of composition     Figure 1 illustrates sensory results of the composition as shown in Example 1, after being aerated according to Example 3. Figure 1 showed that the test composition performed significantly better foamability and associated sensory characteristics than blue and light blue top milk, despite having only 0.2% fat content.     Figure 2 illustrates sensory results of non-aerated samples. It shows that the test composition had better texture profiles than ""Calci-trim"". Calci-trim includes a similar level of fat (0.2%) and protein (5.9%) to the test composition. Therefore, a key difference is the denatured retentate in the test composition which is leading to the beneficial results seen. The test composition also slightly better texture profiles compared to non-aerated 1.5% fat (light blue) milk.     Example 6: Effect of adding whey powder Total solid content is considered to be a highly beneficial aspect to control which can contribute to both improved foamability and foam stability characteristics.     As shown in Figure 3, the test composition containing 10.5% total protein outperformed the test composition containing 9.5% total solids, especially over the first 13 minutes following aeration when a beverage is most likely to be consumed. After 13 minutes both products foam stability declined, but at an equal rate.     Example 7: Effect of varying ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein within test composition     It was found that careful adjustment of the denatured : un-denatured protein ratio led to different foam volume results. As illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, it was identified that by configuring the composition to include approximately 50:50 ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein provided the most optimal foamability and stability results. However, there is clearly a beneficial range between about 10:90 to 90:10 ratio of denatured to un-denatured protein. Although not shown in Figures 4 and 5, tests were conducted on Blue top (3.3 % fat) milk, Light blue top (1.5 % fat) and a test sample with 100% denatured protein.     For the Blue top milk sample containing a ratio of 0:100 denatured to un-denatured protein, the total foam volume depleted quickly to 245 ml within 7-8 minutes.     For the Light Blue top milk sample (also with no denatured protein), the total foam volume also depleted much faster than all the test samples shown in Figure 4 and 5, albeit not at the sharp rate as seen with the Blue top milk. Total volume had depleted to about 285 by about 10 minutes, and to 245 ml by about the 13 minute time point.     For the 100:0 denatured test sample, it performed very similarly (poorly) to the Light Blue top milk sample, again significantly worse than all the test samples with varying degrees of denatured to un-denatured protein.     A further point of difference is that with the Blue Top, Light Blue Top and the denatured test sample, each produced disadvantageous macro-foams, and hence lower sensory quality compared to the micro-foams produced by the present invention.     Example 8: Stability (viscosity / particle size and pH vs time) The test composition (of Example 1) was analysed over a two week period at 4C. The results are shown below. Viscosity, particle size and pH are all stably maintained.     Preliminary results from long-term (3 month) stability trials for UHT treated samples show full stability (results not shown) at 20C, 30C and 40C. No effect was seen on UHT samples with regards to foamability, foam stability and/or overall mouth feel.     Viscosity Partic e size     (mPa.S) D(3,2) D(4,3) PH     Week O 3.24 0.1 0.121 6.7     Week l 3.41 0.1 0.121 6.61     Week 2 3.49 0.1 0.121 6.64     Example 9: Viscosity measurements     Various samples were analysed to assess their viscosities. As noted previously, it is thought the aggregates caused by the denaturation of the retentate lead to an increased viscosity of the composition, and thus might be contributing to the improved functional (e.g. foamability) and foam stability and sensorial properties.     As can be seen in the table below, the heated retentate shows considerably higher viscosity levels than the unheated retentate. Equally, the ""no fat"" composition (skim milk + heated retentate and whey powder) has a higher viscosity that it's closest counter-part; Calci-trim.     <img class=""EMIRef"" id=""368300449-imgf000026_0001"" />    These are some examples of how the present invention may be applied to commercial products (should not be seen as limiting):     a) Hot and cold application     b) Milk shakes, coffee, beverage at home     c) A ready to drink (RTD) beverage that can be aerated by shaking before drinking in the bottle itself or in a closed container. d) Milk shakes, coffee beverage at cafe, food service or fast food outlets e) RTD beverage- processed and stored under frozen, chilled and ambient conditions f) Powder form     g) Smoothie     h) Frozen beverages     i) Ready to eat desserts     j) In capsules for coffee or beverage machines, as powder or liquid source of milk k) Cold cappuccino     I) Blended with soy, juice etc.     m) Fortified with functional ingredients     n) Carbonated     o) Added/flushed with liquid nitrogen     Aspects of the present invention have been described by way of example only and it should be appreciated that modifications and additions may be made thereto without departing from the scope thereof as defined in the appended claims.

The dry flowable composition may for instance be used in the treatment and/or prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) such as cystitis.","FIELD    [0001]    The present invention relates to compositions comprising powdered plant extracts, e.g. extracts of birch leaves or solidago leaves; in particular, dry flowable compositions intended for dissolution in water in order to provide a drinking solution of the plant extract. The present invention further relates to compositions used in the treatment and/or prevention of urinary tract infections.     BACKGROUND    [0002]    In the field of bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs), the use of plant extracts is still very common. Known plants and/or plant components exhibiting for instance a diuretic effect include bearberry leaves (or meal berry), birch leaves, solidago leaves (also called goldenrod), orthosiphon leaves, dandelion, horsetail herbs, parsley, restharrow roots, juniper berries, black currant leaves, garden lovage and asparagus. Other plant extracts are assumed to prevent or limit the attachment of UTI-inducing bacteria to the bladder mucosa, the so-called urothelium; e.g. cranberry extract.     [0003]    Since it is generally recommended to increase the amount of consumed liquids during UTIs in order to remove as many bacteria as possible via the urine, drinking solutions present an advantageous vehicle for the plant extracts. As a further benefit, drinking solutions are easily swallowable by subjects of any age. Hence, some of the plant extracts are sold as alcoholic solutions; e.g. as concentrated drops, often to be taken with a bit of sugar (often sucrose) or diluted in water to mask their taste. However, this is not an appropriate approach for e.g. infants, kids or any subject which does not want to consume alcohol, either due to alcoholism, religious concerns and/or risk of affecting co-medication.     [0004]    One approach was to provide powdered plant extracts, either milled or obtained by spray-drying or freeze-drying liquid extracts. A common issue with at least some of these powdered plant extracts, though, is that they tend to self-agglomerate and form lumps upon dispersion into water, leading to reduced dissolution rates and in some cases sediments. In some but not all cases, this problem may be overcome to some degree by vigorous stirring; yet often such stirring then causes the mixture to foam, which is unsightly and may affect dosing accuracy.     [0005]    It is thus an object of the present invention to provide compositions for oral delivery of powdered plant extracts which can be stored in dry state and easily dispersed and dissolved in water prior to consumption without the formation of foam, agglomerates and/or sediments. A further object is to provide a method for the treatment and/or prevention of urinary tract infections such as cystitis using said compositions, for instance compositions comprising birch leaf extract and/or solidago leaf extract.     [0006]    Further objects will become apparent on the basis of the following description including the examples, and the patent claims.     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION    [0007]    In a first aspect, the invention provides a dry flowable composition comprising granules, said granules comprising (a) a powdered plant extract, (b) a carrier mixture comprising a water-soluble substance selected from a sugar and/or sugar alcohol and a separating agent at a weight ratio of 1 : 1 or higher, and optionally (c) a surfactant. The powdered plant extract may for instance be a birch leaf extract and/or a solidago leaf extract, the birch leaf extract optionally comprising at least 2 % flavonoids.     [0008]    Typically, the inventive granules in the dry flowable composition comprise from about 10 to about 70 wt.-% powdered plant extract; from about 20 to about 80 wt.-% sugar and/or sugar alcohol; from about 3 to about 20 wt.-% separating agent; and/or from about 0.01 to about 3 wt.-% surfactant. In a more specific embodiment, the granules comprise from about 30 to about 50 wt.-% powdered plant extract; from about 40 to about 60 wt.-% sugar and/or sugar alcohol; from about 5 to about 10 wt.-% separating agent; and/or from about 0.05 to about 1 wt.-% surfactant.     [0009]    The sugar and/or sugar alcohol may be selected from glucose, fructose, mannose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol, isomalt, or mixtures thereof. The separating agent may be selected from calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate, fumaric acid, or mixtures thereof.     [0010]    Preferably, the weight ratio of the sugar and/or sugar alcohol and the separating agent in the carrier mixture of the granules ranges from about 4 : 1 to about 11 : 1, or from about 5.5 : 1 to about 8.5 : 1.     [0011]    The granules may for instance comprise sucrose, calcium carbonate as the separating agent and polysorbate as the surfactant (e.g. polysorbate 20).     [0012]    The dry flowable compositions may further comprise mannose (preferably D-mannose), optionally at an amount of about 10 to about 70 wt.-%; and/or one or more vitamins, e.g. vitamin A and/or vitamin D3. Furthermore, the compositions may comprise one or more, preferably extragranular, excipients selected from edible acids (e.g. citric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid or lactic acid, or combinations thereof); pH-modifying agents such as citrates; natural and/or artificial flavours; anti-foaming agents such as medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) with 6 to 12 carbon atoms or simethicone; and/or sweeteners (e.g. aspartame, sucralose, cyclamate, neotame, neohesperidin, acesulfame potassium, saccharin, advantame, thaumatin, stevia, stevioside, and/or mixtures thereof).     [0013]    A typical composition according to the invention may comprise about 30 to 60 % mannose; about 5 to 20 % powdered birch leaf extract and/or powdered solidago leaf extract; about 10 to30 % sucrose; about 0.5 to 3 % calcium carbonate; about 5 to 25 % citric acid; about 3 to 15 % trimagnesium dicitrate; about 3 to 15 % monosodium citrate; and about 0.001 to 2 % surfactant.     [0014]    In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for the preparation of the dry flowable composition according to the invention, comprising the steps ofa) mixing the sugar and/or sugar alcohol and the separating agent,b) adding a solution comprising an alcohol selected from ethanol or isopropanol, and optionally a surfactant, to the mixture of step a to form a carrier mixture,c) adding the powdered plant extract to the carrier mixture of step b, andd) drying the product of step c, ande) adding to the product of step d mannose and/or vitamin(s) and/or at least one extragranular excipient selected from edible acids (e.g. citric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid or lactic acid, or combinations thereof); pH-modifying agents such as citrates; natural and/or artificial flavours; anti-foaming agents such as medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) with 6 to 12 carbon atoms or simethicone; and/or sweeteners (e.g. aspartame, sucralose, cyclamate, neotame, neohesperidin, acesulfame potassium, saccharin, advantame, thaumatin, stevia, stevioside, and/or mixtures thereof).    [0015]    In a further aspect, the invention provides a single dose unit or package comprising the dry flowable composition according to the invention. Typically, the amount of the total composition is about 2000 to 6000 mg, the amount of granules in said composition is about 800 to 1200 mg, and/or the amount of flavonoids is about 5 to 20 mg.     [0016]    In a yet further aspect, the invention provides an oral liquid composition obtained from dissolving or dispersing the dry flowable composition of the invention, or the single dose unit thereof in water or an aqueous ingestible liquid.     [0017]    In a further aspect, the invention provides the use of the dry flowable composition as well as single dose units or oral liquid composition thereof in the treatment and/or prevention of urinary tract infections, such as cystitis.

For instance ""%"" is to be understood as ""wt.-%"" unless otherwise specified.     [0022]    As used herein terms like ""about"", ""approximately"" or ""ca."" shall compensate for any variability allowed for in the pharmaceutical and/or nutraceutical industry and inherent in their respective products, such as differences in content due to manufacturing variations and/or time-induced product degradation.     [0023]    The expressions, 'one embodiment', 'an embodiment', 'a specific embodiment' and the like mean that a particular feature, property or characteristic, or a particular group or combination of features, properties or characteristics, as referred to in combination with the respective expression, is present in at least one of the embodiments of the invention. These expressions, occurring in various places throughout this description, do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment. Moreover, the particular features, properties or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments     [0024]    The term ""sugar"" refers to sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates from various sources. The term includes monosaccharides (such as glucose, fructose or mannose), and disaccharides (such as sucrose, maltose, lactose, lactulose, maltulose, trehalose or palatinose).     [0025]    The term ""sugar alcohol"" refers to organic compounds of the general formula: HOCH2(CHOH)nCH2OH. They are typically derived from sugar and, unlike sugars, usually linear molecules. They are also known as polyhydric alcohols, polyalcohols, alditols or glycitols. Common examples of sugar alcohols include mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol, isomalt, lactitol or inositol.     [0026]    A ""separating agent"" as used herein is a solid, fine powdered substance, typically below 10 m particle size, which is practically insoluble, very slightly soluble or at most slightly soluble in water at room temperature; and which is capable of covering, or coating the surface of other solid particles, typically particles with a larger particle size than the separating agent. Any solubility provisions such as ""slightly soluble"" as used herein shall be understood as aqueous solubilities and ranked according to pharmacopoeial standards (e.g. European Pharmacopeia) unless specified otherwise.     [0027]    Any particle size provisions such as <20 m or <10 m shall be understood as sieve diameters; i.e. particles of a sieve diameter <20 m would normally pass through a sieve having an aperture, or opening size, of 20 m. Within a formulation comprising a plurality of particles, these particle sizes should be interpreted to characterise the preferred mass median sieve diameters of particles (so-called D50 value), unless where provided otherwise. The D90-value refers to the particle size of the sieve which 90 % of the particle would pass. It is to be understood that commonly the particle size values of D50 and/or D90 are calculated from the measured particle size distribution. The latter may be measured using laser diffraction or other dynamic imaging techniques using e.g. pulsed LED light.     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION    [0028]    In a first aspect, the invention provides a dry flowable composition comprising granules, said granules comprising (a) a powdered plant extract, (b) a carrier mixture comprising a water-soluble substance selected from a sugar and/or sugar alcohol and a separating agent at a weight ratio of 1 : 1 or higher, and optionally (c) a surfactant.     [0029]    In one specific embodiment of the invention, the powdered plant extract is a birch leaf extract and/or a solidago leaf extract. In a more specific embodiment, the powdered plant extract is a birch leaf extract comprising at least 2 % flavonoids. Earlier attempts to formulate such powdered birch leaf extracts and/or solidago leaf extracts into drinking solutions without the inventive granules suffered from noticeable, unsightly foam formation and poor dissolution with residues/sediments remaining at the bottom of the drinking vessel. The foam formation is presumed to be associated - at least in parts - with the saponin content in birch leaf extracts and solidago leaf extracts; though the 'foaming problem' is by no means limited to saponin-containing plant extracts. Similar problems are known from other powdered plant extracts such as sage (clary, salvia), ginseng, horse chestnut or gynostemma (Jiaugulan), harpagophytum, echinacea or urtica.     [0030]    This problem was successfully overcome by the granules of the invention. The inventors surprisingly found that granules based on the carrier mixture provide improved dissolution properties to powdered plant extracts, characterised by limited foam formation during stirring and complete and rapid dissolution in cold water, typically within less than 30-40 seconds after short stirring (e.g. about 10 seconds).     [0031]    The mechanism for this improved dissolution performance is not yet understood in detail. One aspect is that the combination of a powdered plant extract with a water-soluble substance selected from a sugar and/or sugar alcohol and a separating agent helps to prevent the agglomeration of the powdered plant extract by coating the surface of the water-soluble substance with it, thereby separating and/or dispersing the powdered plant extract. It is further believed that upon dissolution of the granules, the main carrier mixture component - namely the sugar and/or sugar alcohol - allows for rapid dissolution of the granules, while the separating agent ensures that the powdered plant extract particles do not 're-agglomerate' and hence also dissolve quicker as they would without the carrier mixture.     [0032]    As defined above, the separating agent is a finely powdered, poorly soluble material (at most slightly soluble), with a particle size that enables the agent to cover, or coat, surfaces of larger sized particles evenly. Due to its larger surface area per weight, the amount of separating agent needed is smaller than the amount of the water-soluble main carrier mixture component, the sugar and/or sugar alcohol; hence, the ratio of sugar and/or sugar alcohol and the separating agent is 1 : 1 or higher. In one embodiment, the weight ratio of the sugar and/or sugar alcohol and the separating agent in the carrier mixture of the granules ranges from about 4 : 1 to about 11 : 1. In another embodiment, the weight ratio is from about 5.5 : 1 to about 8.5 : 1; for instance 6 : 1, 6.5 : 1, 7 : 1, 7.5 : 1 or 8 : 1. In one of the preferred embodiments, the ratio is about 7 : 1.     [0033]    In one embodiment, the sugar and/or sugar alcohol is selected from glucose, fructose, mannose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol, isomalt, or mixtures thereof; and/or the separating agent is selected from calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate, fumaric acid, or mixtures thereof. Any combination is possible as long as the selected separating agent is capable of adhering to the surface of the sugar and/or sugar alcohol.     [0034]    In one embodiment, the sugar and/or sugar alcohol is sucrose. In one embodiment, the separating agent is calcium carbonate. In a specific embodiment, the sugar and/or sugar alcohol is sucrose, the separating agent is calcium carbonate, and/or the surfactant is a polysorbate. Optionally, the polysorbate is polysorbate 20 (also known commercially as Tween<>20).     [0035]    In one of the preferred embodiments, the sugar and/or sugar alcohol is sucrose, the separating agent is calcium carbonate and the surfactant is polysorbate 20. Exemplary formulations using this carrier mixture are described in the examples. In this embodiment, the sucrose is preferably used in particle sizes as commonly found in caster sugar; i.e. between about 100 and 1000 m, or between about 200 and 800 m; and the calcium carbonate in particle sizes below 20 m, or below 10 m, or with a D90-value below 10 m, such as to allow good adherence of the calcium carbonate to the sucrose crystals' surfaces.     [0036]    In one embodiment, the granules in the dry flowable composition comprise from about 10 to about 70 % powdered plant extract; from about 20 to about 80 % sugar and/or sugar alcohol; from about 3 to about 20 % separating agent; and/or from about 0.01 to about 3 % surfactant. In a specific embodiment, the granules comprise about 30 to 50 % powdered plant extract; about 40 to 60 % sugar and/or sugar alcohol; about 5 to 10 % separating agent; and/or about 0.05 to 1 % surfactant. In another specific embodiment, the granules comprise about 35 to 45 % powdered plant extract; about 45 to 55 % sugar and/or sugar alcohol; about 6 to 9 % separating agent; and/or about 0.05 to 0.2 % surfactant. In one of the preferred embodiments, the granules comprise about 42 % powdered plant extract (e.g. birch leaf extract and/or solidago leaf extract), about 50 % sugar and/or sugar alcohol (e.g. sucrose); about 7 % separating agent (e.g. calcium carbonate) and about 0.1 % surfactant (e.g. polysorbate 20).     [0037]    In one embodiment, the dry flowable composition further comprises mannose, optionally at an amount of about 10 to about 70 %. In cases where the composition is intended for use in the treatment and/or prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) such as cystitis, D-mannose is preferred, since it prevents or limits the attachment of UTI-inducing bacteria to the bladder mucosa, the so-called urothelium.     [0038]    In addition or alternatively, the composition further comprises a vitamin. Optionally, the vitamin is selected from vitamin A (retinol), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and vitamin E (tocopherol). These vitamins provide mucosal protection, as is preferred e.g. in the treatment and/or prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) such as cystitis and other infections involving mucosal tissue. In one specific embodiment, the vitamin is vitamin A, vitamin D3 or a combination thereof.     [0039]    In one embodiment, the composition further comprises one or more preferably extragranular excipients selected from edible acids, pH-modifying agents, sweeteners, natural and/or artificial flavours, and/or anti-foaming agents.     [0040]    Optionally, the edible acid is selected from citric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid and lactic acid or combinations thereof. Further optionally, the pH-modifying agent is selected from citrates; for instance from trimagnesium dicitrate, monosodium citrate, disodium citrate. In one embodiment, citric acid is used. In one of the preferred embodiments, citric acid is used in combination with monosodium citrate and/or trimagnesium dicitrate.     [0041]    Further optionally, the sweetener is selected from aspartame, sucralose, cyclamate, neotame, neohesperidin, acesulfame potassium, saccharin, advantame, thaumatin, stevia or stevioside, or mixtures thereof.     [0042]    Optionally, the natural and/or artificial flavours are selected from dried fruit juice or herbal extracts and/or artificial flavours such as honey-, orange-, lemon-, cherry-, tropical fruit-, grapes-, berries-, banana-, contramarum-, or peach aroma, or mixtures thereof. Artificial flavours may be nature identical.     [0043]    Further optionally, the anti-foaming agent is selected from medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) with 6 to 12 carbon atoms, such as medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) with 8 to 12 carbon atoms (e.g. Miglyol<>812), or simethicone.     [0044]    In one of the preferred embodiments, the dry flowable composition comprises from about 30 to about 60 % mannose; from about 5 to about 20 % powdered birch leaf extract and/or powdered solidago leaf extract; from about 10 to about 30 % sucrose; from about 0.5 to about 3 % calcium carbonate; from about 5 to about 25 % citric acid; from about 3 to about 15 % trimagnesium dicitrate; from about 3 to about 15 % monosodium citrate; and from about 0.001 to about 2 % surfactant.     [0045]    In this embodiment, the powdered birch leaf extract and/or the powdered solidago leaf extract, the calcium carbonate, the polysorbate and parts of the sucrose content is provided in the form of granules. Yet, further sucrose may be added extragranular as well in order to optimise the taste of the composition. Further optional excipients for this embodiment include sweeteners, flavours, vitamins and anti-foaming agents such as medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) with 6 to 12 carbon atoms (e.g. Miglyol<>812) or simethicone.     [0046]    In one embodiment, the dry flowable composition comprises about 35 to 45 % mannose; about 5 to 15 % powdered birch leaf extract and/or powdered solidago leaf extract; about 15 to 20 % sucrose; about 1 to 2 % calcium carbonate; about 10 to 15 % citric acid; about 5 to 10 % trimagnesium dicitrate; about 5 to 10 % monosodium citrate; and about 0.01 to 0.1 % surfactant.     [0047]    In a specific embodiment, the dry flowable composition comprises about 43 % mannose; about 10 % powdered birch leaf extract and/or powdered solidago leaf extract; about 17 % sucrose (in total); about 2 % calcium carbonate; about 12 % citric acid; about 8 % trimagnesium dicitrate; about 7 % monosodium citrate; and about 1 % in total of polysorbate 20, vitamin A, vitamin D3, sucralose, aspartame, and a C8-C12-MCT (e.g. Miglyol<>812). An exemplary formulation is described in the examples below.     [0048]    While the invention is particularly useful for powdered plant extracts which contain saponins and/or exhibit foaming when stirred into aqueous liquids, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to only those extracts. It is irrelevant from which type of plant the extract is derived (e.g. herbs, bushes, trees), or from which part of the plant (e.g. roots, leaves, flower, fruits) or by which extraction method and/or extraction medium.     [0049]    It should further be understood, that depending on the specific extract to be obtained, the extraction method and/or the extraction medium, some powdered plant extracts as commercially available may comprise additional substances such as excipients, i.e. substances which were not derived, or extracted from the plant as such, but which are added during the preparation process of the powdered plant extracts. For instance, the commercially available powdered solidago leaf extract as employed in Examples 1-3 further below comprises 10 % maltodextrin.     [0050]    In a further aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of the dry flowable composition described above, the process comprising the steps ofa) mixing the sugar and/or sugar alcohol and the separating agent,b) adding a solution comprising an alcohol selected from ethanol or isopropanol, and optionally a surfactant, to the mixture of step a to form a carrier mixture,c) adding the powdered plant extract to the carrier mixture of step b, andd) drying the product of step c, ande) adding to the product of step d mannose and/or vitamin(s) and/or at least one extragranular excipient selected from edible acids, optionally selected from citric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid and/or lactic acid;pH-modifying agents, optionally selected from citrates;sweeteners, optionally selected from aspartame, sucralose, cyclamate, neotame, neohesperidin, acesulfame potassium, saccharin, advantame, thaumatin, stevia, stevioside, and/or mixtures thereof;natural and/or artificial flavours; and/oranti-foaming agents, optionally selected from medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) with 6 to 12 carbon atoms or simethicone.    [0051]    The process may be performed in any common granulation device suited to homogenously apply the particles of the separating agent and the powdered plant extract to the surfaces of the water-soluble main component of the carrier mixture (i.e. the sugar and/or sugar alcohol). For instance, a 'single-pot' granulation device may be used, optionally equipped with vacuum means such as the Topo-granulator.     [0052]    The sugar and/or sugar alcohol and the separating agent should not dissolve in the alcoholic solution, or at most to a negligible degree. This helps to spread small amounts of solution more easily between the two powders without the risk for agglomeration and to thereby cover, or coat, the surface of the sugar and/or sugar alcohol crystals evenly with the fine powdered separating agent. Hence, the water content in the alcoholic solution should be kept below 10 %, or preferably below 7 %. In one embodiment, the pure alcohol is used. In one of the preferred embodiments ethanol is used as the alcohol, for instance ethanol 96 % (V/V).     [0053]    Optionally, a surfactant, such as a polysorbate, may be dissolved in the alcoholic, or ethanolic, solution in order to improve the wetting of the powders.     [0054]    Once a homogenous mixture is obtained, the powdered plant extract is added and dispersed in the carrier mixture. Since most powdered plant extracts are at least partially soluble in alcoholic solutions, the extract will 'stick' to the wetted carrier mixture particles while the separating agent prevents the auto-agglomeration, or self-agglomeration, of the plant extract particles during this process. Like this, an even layer of plant extract (partially in particulate state, partially dissolved) is formed on top of the carrier mixture particles, yielding the granules of the invention.     [0055]    The thus obtained granules are subsequently dried; optionally using increased temperatures and/or vacuum. For instance, the granules may be dried at 50 C under vacuum, optionally within the 'single-pot' granulator. During the drying step, the alcohol should evaporate completely, such as to leave no alcohol (other than e.g. sugar alcohols) in the final product.     [0056]    Since the size of the sugar and/or sugar alcohol crystals typically exceeds the particle sizes of the separating agent and the powdered plant extract by at least a multitude of two, only a small size increase of the sugar and/or sugar alcohol particles is noticeable after granulation, such that the dried product is ready for further processing. Nonetheless a sieving step may be performed - if considered expedient - to remove any oversized particles after the drying and prior to processing the granules further.     [0057]    Alternatively, to the process described above, the powdered plant extract may also be added directly to the sugar and/or sugar alcohol and the separating agent in step (a); i.e. prior to the addition of the alcoholic solution. Whether sufficient homogeneity of the granulation mixture can be obtained with this approach, depends on a number of factors, such as the solubility of the extract in the alcoholic solution and/or the extent of its auto-agglomeration tendencies. It should be noted that this alternative process does not deviate from the current invention, as long as the plant extract and the separating agent can be applied evenly and homogenously to the sugar and/or sugar alcohol particles.     [0058]    The dried granules of step (c) may then be mixed with any further excipients of the composition; for instance with mannose and/or vitamins and/or excipient selected from edible acids, pH-modifying agents, sweeteners, natural and/or artificial flavours and/or anti-foaming agents. It is understood that any mixing device, mixing duration and any order of adding the further components is allowed as long as the final dry flowable composition is homogenous. The final composition is then ready for packaging.     [0059]    In a yet further aspect the invention provides a single dose unit or package comprising the dry flowable composition described above. The single dose unit may be packaged in any suitable packaging material, such as foil-lined sachets or stickpacks, or small vials or bottles made from either glass or plastic materials. In one embodiment of the single dose unit or package, the amount of the total dry flowable composition is from about 2000 to about 6000 mg, and the amount of granules in the composition is from about 800 to about 1200 mg; and/or wherein the amount of flavonoids is from about 5 to about 20 mg. In a specific embodiment, the amount of the total dry flowable composition is about 4000 to 5000 mg (e.g. about 4500 mg or about 4600 mg), and the amount of granules in the composition is about 1000 to 1100 mg (e.g. about 1050 mg); and/or wherein the amount of flavonoids is from about 8 to about 15 mg (e.g. about 10 mg or about 15 mg).     [0060]    If the single dose unit comprises mannose and/or vitamins in addition to the granules, their respective amounts should be chosen in such a way as to not exceed the recommended daily intake when taking into account the intended number of single dose units to be administered per day.     [0061]    The dry flowable composition and/or the single dose unit or package thereof are intended for dissolution in water or another aqueous ingestible liquid in order to prepare a drinking solution. Hence, the invention further provides an oral liquid composition obtained from dissolving the dry flowable composition according to the invention or the single dose unit or package thereof in water or an aqueous ingestible liquid. Such drinking solutions are on one hand advantageous in that they can be easily swallowed by subjects of any age; they may even be administered by nasal or oral feeding tubes if needed. A further advantage of drinking solutions is that they increase the fluid uptake of the subject as is particularly desirable in the treatment and/or the prevention of urinary tract infections, such as cystitis.     [0062]    Hence, in a final aspect, the invention provides the dry flowable composition as described above, or the single dose unit or package thereof, or the oral liquid composition obtained thereof for use in the treatment and/or prevention of urinary tract infections.     [0063]    In one of the preferred embodiments, a composition is used comprising both, a birch leaf extract and D-mannose; or a solidago leaf extract and D-mannose; or alternatively a combination of birch leaf and solidago leaf extract together with D-mannose. Like this a synergistic effect is obtained:D-mannose prevents or limits the attachment of UTI-inducing bacteria to the bladder mucosa, the so-called urothelium; andthe birch leaf extract and/or the solidago leaf extract provide(s) a diuretic effect which helps to 'flush out' said bacteria quickly. Furthermore, vitamins A and D3 were found to be advantageous to protect the urothelium.    Examples    Example 1 - Preparation of plant extract granules    [0064]    In a laboratory scale experiment, granules according to the invention (1) are prepared by blending sucrose and calcium carbonate and granulating them with an ethanolic solution comprising 1 % polysorbate 20 (e.g. 0.2 g Polysorbate dissolved up to 20 mL in ethanol) to improve the surface wetting of the sucrose and calcium carbonate particles. To the thus obtained carrier mixture, either powdered birch leaf extract (here with a flavonoid content of about 2.3 %; granules 1-3) or powdered solidago leaf extract (granules 4-6), or an exemplary 50:50 blend of both extracts (granules 7) is added gradually and mixed until homogeneity.     [0065]    The resulting granules are dried to constant weight at 50 C under vacuum.     [0066]    For comparison, similar granules were prepared omitting either the use of the calcium carbonate (2, 5) or the use of the sucrose (3, 6). The composition of all three granules is provided in Table 1 below.Table 1: Composition (amounts in gram) of granules 1-7 Sucrose10.512.0---10.512.0---10.5Birch leaf extract8.78.78.7---------4.35Solidago leaf extract---------8.78.78.74.35Calcium carbonate1.5---12.01.5---12.01.5Polysorbate 200.02*0.02*0.02*0.02*0.02*0.02*0.02** 0.2 g Polysorbate dissolved up to 20 mL in ethanol; 2 mL added to sucrose/CaCO3    Example 2 - Preparation of dry flowable composition    [0067]    About 1 part of the plant extract granules obtained in Example 1 are combined with about 4 parts further excipients and blended until homogeneity to form a dry flowable composition according to the invention. The components of the composition and their respective contents in wt.-% are provided in Table 2 below.     [0068]    A single dose unit of this composition comprises about 2 g D-mannose, about 10 mg flavonoids from birch leaf extract (granules 1-3), about 120 g Vitamin A and about 200 I.E. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). The single unit may be packaged in a sachet or stickpack; alternatively, it may be packaged in ampoules, vials or small bottles.     [0069]    Upon use, the dry flowable composition is dissolved in water (e.g. about 200 mL) and stirred for about 10 seconds or until the composition is completely dissolved and ready for oral consumption.Table 2: Components of a dry flowable composition and their contents in wt.-% D-Mannose43.48Birch leaf extract (comprising 2.3 % flavonoids), and/or Solidago leaf extract9.46Vitamin A-palmitate 250.000 IE/g0.05Cholecalciferol 100.000 SD/S0.05Sucrose17.05Citric acid (anhydrous)11.96Trimagnesium-dicitrate (anhydrous)7.83Monosodium citrate7.39Calcium carbonate1.63Aspartame0.59Aroma0.33Sucralose0.15Polysorbate 200.02Medium chain triglycerides (C8to C12)0.02    Example 3 - Dissolution behaviour of plant extract granules    [0070]    The plant extract granules obtained in Example 1 are mixed with further ingredients in analogy to Example 2 and the resulting dry flowable compositions 1-3 were dissolved at room temperature in about 200 mL water and stirred for about 10 seconds. About 30 seconds after stirring the obtained drinking compositions are inspected visually.     [0071]    The results are provided in Table 3 below.Table 3: Results of visual inspection of dissolution behaviour of compositions 1-3  1 Composition completely dissolved; very minor foam formation 2 Composition not completely dissolved; Brown sediment of plant extract remains even after 120 s 3 No visual plant extract sediments; but lots of persisting foam Taste and pH not optimal for repeated oral consumption 4 Composition completely dissolved; very minor foam formation 5 Composition not completely dissolved; Brown sediment of plant extract remains even after 120 s 6 No visual plant extract sediments; but lots of persisting foam Taste and pH not optimal for repeated oral consumption 7 Composition completely dissolved; very minor foam formation    [0072]    As can be seen from these results, only the combination of sucrose with the separating agent calcium carbonate provides the desired dissolution performance with compositions 1, 4 and 7 dissolving completely with only very minor foam formation. Without the use of the separating agent, the plant extract particles do not dissolve properly and form a sediment instead. This shows that the inventive effect does not reside in simply dispersing plant extract particles in sucrose particles to counter-act their agglomeration tendencies. On the other hand, without the use of the water-soluble sucrose (and more calcium carbonate instead), lots of persisting foam is formed upon stirring.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION    [0006]    It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, where appropriate, reference numerals have been repeated among the different figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. In addition, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments described herein. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments described herein can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, methods, procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the related relevant feature being described. Also, the description is not to be considered as limiting the scope of the embodiments described herein. The drawings are not necessarily to scale and the proportions of certain parts have been exaggerated to better illustrate details and features of the present disclosure.     [0007]    The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to ""an"" or ""one"" embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.     [0008]    Several definitions that apply throughout this disclosure will now be presented.     [0009]    The term ""outside"" refers to a region that is beyond the outermost confines of a physical object. The term ""inside"" indicates that at least a portion of a region is partially contained within a boundary formed by the object. The term ""substantially"" is defined to be essentially conforming to the particular dimension, shape or other word that substantially modifies, such that the component need not be exact. For example, substantially cylindrical means that the object resembles a cylinder, but can have one or more deviations from a true cylinder. The term ""comprising,"" when utilized, means ""including, but not necessarily limited to""; it specifically indicates open-ended inclusion or membership in the so-described combination, group, series and the like.     [0010]    Referring to FIG. 1 , an atomizer 100 is shown. The atomizer 100 is configured (i.e., structured and arranged) for coupling with a power supply 200 to form an electronic cigarette (as seen in FIG. 6 ). Referring to FIGS. 2-3 , the atomizer 100 includes a liquid supply 20 for storing tobacco liquid, and a connecting component 30 configured for connecting the liquid supply 20 and the power supply 30. The connecting component 30 includes a liquid conducting element 33 and a heating element 34 in contact with the liquid conducting element 33. The connecting component 30 has a first end 31 and a second end 32. The first end 31 is configured for connecting with the liquid supply 20, while the second end 32 is configured for connecting with the power supply 200.

[0002]    Generally, chocolate or crme mass continuously tempered by the apparatus according to the invention encompass all types of suspensions of non-fat particles such as sugar, milk powders and cocoa solids mixed up with a liquid fat constituent, so that the suspensions are capable of crystallizing. It could be both chocolate types used in any kind of production of chocolate articles or it could be crme mass used inside articles as filling, upon or as ""sandwiching"" layers in articles in both production of bakery articles as well as of chocolate articles. When it comes to the most widely used chocolate mass types, the fat constituent comprises genuine cocoa butter typically in a content of up to approximately 35%. However, the fat phase may also comprise substitutes as well. A small content of up to 2-3 % of genuine cocoa butter may still be left in the recipe. Substitutes may be in the form of other types of fat-containing oils such as palm-kernel oil. Chocolate types having the cocoa butter been replaced by other fats are often named commercially as compound chocolate, especially when the cocoa butter has been replaced completely by palm-kernel oil. Mass made of up to 100% cocoa butter may however also be continuously tempered. It is used later on as constituent in the production of different chocolate mass recipes.     [0003]    For the continuous tempering to be performed, it is decisive, that whether the fat phase constitutes of genuine cocoa butter or substitutes, the fat phase must be capable of crystallizing into stable crystal types, such as the V-crystals developing in genuine cocoa butter. However, it is important to avoid instable crystals in the solidified mass. Only then, eatable chocolate articles with good taste, crisp break and shiny appearance are created. The solidified chocolate articles will also achieve the longest possible shelf life and the best resistance against bloom, as instable crystals are diminished. If there is a content of in-stable crystals left in the mass, they will give rise to shorter shelf-life as the articles will bloom more quickly as when in-stable crystals are not present.     [0004]    For the manufacturers of articles made by such masses, it is always desirable, that the prior art tempering apparatus can deliver tempered mass having a content of the stable crystal-type only, such as V-crystals in chocolate mass. Only then, the manufacturer can rely on, that the quality of his chocolate products are consistent.     [0005]    The prior tempering apparatus of the introductory art comprise a cooling stage, a crystallization stage and a reheating stage arranged in the column. The stages are typically arranged each in their own separate section of the column, often separated by an isolation disc between neighboring chambers. Some apparatuses have the cooling and crystallization stages arranged in the same section of the column. However, all the prior art apparatuses have columns, which are high, heavy and extensive.     [0006]    Before the chocolate or crme mass is supplied to perform the actual tempering process it is heated to around 40-50C in a premature step. All the crystals in the particular mass are melted out and dissolved in the mass before the mass is pumped continuously through the cooling stage of the column. The premature step is typically arranged distant to the tempering apparatus, the mass being heated in a storage tank. However, a premature heating step could also be arranged in the tempering column in front of the cooling stage, which then makes the column even higher.     [0007]    The chamber surfaces of the cooling and crystallisation stages are kept ""cold"" with temperatures typically between 8-15 C regulated by the temperature and flow of the water in the intermediary chambers. The low temperatures are necessary for the heat-exchange of the cooling and crystallisation stages of the column to be as effective as possible. Otherwise, the columns would be even higher for a particular maximum capacity and mass type. However, the disadvantages of the ""cold"" surface temperatures in the cooling and crystallisation chambers are creation of in-stable crystals simultaneously with the creation of the stable crystals. This phenomenon is especially extensive in the cooling stage.     [0008]    In the reheating stage, the temperature of the mass is raised only slightly being sufficient for melting up again the in-stable crystals only. They are then not present in the mass any longer, however, the desirable stable crystals, such as the V-crystals in chocolate, are still preserved. A high and extensive reheating stage of the column is necessary when complete re-melting of the undesirable, instable crystals must be ensured.     [0009]    When mass with high fat content such as milk chocolate, white chocolate, nougat or filling mass for pralines are tempered, then the amount of in-stable crystals created in the cooling stage is often much too high. The surfaces must be even colder for obtaining an acceptable capacity of tempered mass per hour. So, when chocolate with high fat content is tempered, then, the problems of the high columns are even more relevant     [0010]    A given size of a tempering machine at the market has a fixed length of the column and consequently fixed areas for cooling, crystallisation and reheating.Due to the above described problematic of continuous tempering of masses with a high fat content, it is well-known today, that the maximum capacity measured in kilograms per hour of tempered mass for a given tempering machine at the market, is lowered severely when recipes with a high fat content are tempered. The maximum capacity is achieved when tempering dark chocolate having a fat content between 20-34%. In comparison herewith the capacity is typically lowered around 20% when milk chocolate, compound chocolate, nougat or other mass with a fat content between 30% and 40% is tempered. When high fat recipes having fat content between 40% and 100% are tempered, the maximum capacity is lowered up to 50%.     [0011]    Another major disadvantage for the high columns is a very high energy consumption, firstly for cooling down the total mass and secondly for reheating the mass. Also the energy requirements are high for the chocolate pumps and the gear motors of the tempering columns.     [0012]    The center of gravity of the columns are high above the floor level, which makes the apparatus difficult and cumbersome to transport, maneuver and install in factories. When adapted for tempering of higher capacities of mass, such as typically more than 3000kg/hour, the apparatuses are so high, that they have to be tilted or laid down to horizontal during handling and transportation. This especially applies when the apparatuses are adapted for tempering of mass with high fat-content such as nougat, raw chocolate mass or chocolate liquor requiring around the double cooling capacity than dark chocolate. The columns constitute of heavy cast-iron elements each having a water and a mass chamber. Each element of the big columns may weight up to more than hundred kilograms. When being stacked upon each other the elements constitute the column. Handling and stacking of the heavy elements are difficult and time-consuming and has to be done directly on the apparatus support frame for the bigger versions. Afterwards, the high and heavy columns are difficult to handle and move around in the production environment, for example when the electrical installations has to be made in another area of the factory.     [0013]    EP0685168A1 discloses an apparatus of the introductory art by which a cooling stage A1, a crystallization stage Ak and a reheating stage A2 are arranged in the column. The column itself is high and heavy with the center of gravity at a high level. The apparatuses are then both cumbersome and difficult to build, handle and install in a chocolate production factory.     [0014]    The inventive apparatus is characterised in, that the cooling stage is arranged in a heat exchanger having at least one row of parallel plates arranged in a stack sealed at their edges providing intermediary, neighbouring channels each having an inlet and an outlet, that every second channel in the row is connected with a common first inlet and a common first outlet for the flow of mass there through,and that each of the intermittent, neighbouring channels are connected with a common second inlet and a common second outlet for the flow of water medium there through.     [0015]    In the common first inlet the mass is being split into several streams when entering each second channel in the row. The mass is then flowing in a row of parallel streams through the heat exchanger, simultaneously being tempered by intermittent, neighboring channels each with water medium flowing there through.     [0016]    The tempering of the parallel streams of mass is highly effective. Consequently, the inventive heat exchanger has much smaller outside dimensions than the cooling stage of a prior art column, but is however, still achieving the same cooling effect. Advantageously, the cooling stage heat exchanger fits in several places in the apparatus beside the column, so that the cooling stage is no longer part of the column itself. The inventive apparatus is then both smaller in size and much lower in height than the prior art apparatus. The weight savings are very high as the inventive plate heat exchanger typically reduces the weight of the cooling stage 200-500% in comparison with the prior art apparatus.     [0017]    The mass channels of the cooling stage heat exchanger of the inventive apparatus are free from any intermediary scrapers, discs or wings moving through the chambers such as by the cooling stages of the prior columns. The channels are slim in comparison to the extension of the plates. The row of the many parallel channels ensure that the mass is split into several ""plate-like"" streams, each of them all being exposed to accurately the same tempering conditions exercised by each of the intermittent, neighboring water channels. The inventive heat exchanger is then much more effective than a column of the same volume. When comparing length or width of the inventive cooling stage heat exchanger with diameter of the column, the inventive heat exchanger is superior.     [0018]    The plates of the row of parallel plates can have several forms such as being planar or corrugated as long as the mass is flowing in a row of parallel streams through the cooling stage heat exchanger, simultaneously being tempered by intermittent, neighboring channels each with water medium flowing there through.     [0019]    When the channels have a width of 1-10 mm, the mass flow through the channels simultaneously as a row of parallel plates or sheets. Most preferably, the channels have a width of 2-5 mm, so that the mass flow through the channels as thick, separated pages in a big book. When the channels have a width of 1-2 mm the mass flow as film-like sheets or as pages in a big book.     [0020]    The cooled mass is completely homogenous and uniform in constitution and temperature when leaving the common first outlet. The temperature of the mass leaving the common first outlet is then controlled sharply within tenths of a degree. Consequently, the particular mass can be controlled exactly to a temperature just above the crystal-creating temperature of that mass. This is especially desirable when high-quality mass is tempered. No crystals are made in the mass in the cooling stage, and when the mass enters the crystallization stage of the column, very little cooling is necessary for the creation of the crystals. With other words, the mass is cooled in the inventive plate heat exchanger without the creation of any crystals, which then is ignited when the mass enters the crystallization stage of the column. When no crystals are made in the inventive cooling stage - neither the desirable V-crystals for chocolate mass, nor any lower melting crystals, such as the IV-crystals, then is the process extremely well-controlled.     [0021]    When the crystallization stage extends over all the chambers of the column, the reheating section is omitted. This requires, that the crystallization stage is able to create the desirable, stable crystals in the mass only, such as the the V-crystals in chocolate mass. Creation of undesirable lower melting crystals in the mass must be avoided, otherwise the reheating section is needed.However, when the crystallization stage extends over all the chambers of the column, so that the reheating section is omitted, the height and weight of the column and consequently of the inventive apparatus is the lowest possible in comparison with the prior art.     [0022]    When the row of plates is arranged as a cubic stack, and the common first inlet is connected with a mass inlet tube part at one side of the stack and the common first outlet is connected with a mass outlet tube part at the opposite side of the stack, and the common second inlet is connected with a water inlet tube part at one side of the stack and that the common second outlet is connected with a water outlet tube part at the opposite side of the stack, or vice versa, then the cooling stage heat exchanger is easy and fast to assemble and mount in the apparatus. The geometric cubic stack shape provides for easy fitting in of the stack in corners of the apparatus, close to the floor in the support frame of the apparatus or beside the column.     [0023]    When the mass inlet tube part and the water outlet tube part are arranged at the same side of the stack, and at the opposite side of the stack are arranged both the mass outlet tube part and the water inlet tube part, then are the mass and the water flowing in opposite directions through the stack. When it is desired to obtain the most effective heat transfer between mass and water during the cooling of the mass, such counter-flow is advantageous. The cooling stage heat exchanger stack then obtains the highest heat exchange effect or the smallest possible outer dimensions. When the mass inlet tube part and the water inlet tube part are arranged at the same side of the stack, and at the opposite side of the stack are arranged both the mass outlet tube part and the water outlet tube part, then are the mass and the water flowing in the same direction through the stack. When it is desired to obtain temperatures of mass and water which are close to each other at the end of the stack, i.e. at the termination of the cooling process, such co-current flow or parallel flow of mass and water is advantageous.     [0024]    When a pre-heating stage for the mass is arranged in a second inventive plate heat exchanger in front of the cooling stage, the height of the inventive apparatus is reduced to the lowest possible level in comparison with the height of a prior art apparatus. An apparatus having a column with a pre-heating stage, a cooling stage, a crystallisation stage and a re-heating stage is the highest of all prior tempering apparatuses. For example, is the height reduced from 300 cm for the mentioned prior art apparatus and to a height of 100 cm for the inventive apparatus having the same capacities.

[0026]    The inventive apparatus 1 for continuous tempering of fat-containing, crystallisable mass such as chocolate mass or crme mass comprises a column 2 of stacked circular elements 3 made of cast-iron. Each element 3 has an upper mass chamber 4 and a lower water chamber 5, as disclosed in figure 11 . By the stacking of the elements 3, gaskets 6 ensures that the mass chambers 4 are closed of properly between the neighbouring elements 3. All the mass chambers 4 in the column are connected with each other by non-disclosed openings providing passage vertically through the water chambers 5. The water chambers 5 of the elements 3 are connected to each other in a particular crystallisation or re-heating stage. All the elements 3 in the crystallisation stage are connected to each other and to a supply of temperature controlled water. Many different layouts of water circulation systems are well-known, so these are not described in further detail.     [0027]    A central drive shaft 7 is shown schematically in part, and is driven by a gear motor 8 arranged on the frame or support 9 of the apparatus 1, as disclosed in figure 1 and 2 . The drive shaft 7 is in engagement with mixing elements 10 arranged in each of the mass chambers 4. The mixing elements 10 of the known columns are propels, discs or even planetary mixers. In figure 11 is disclosed a commonly applied mixing propel, seen in section.     [0028]    The cooling stage of the mass tempering apparatus 1 is arranged in a heat exchanger 11 having a row of parallel plates 12 arranged in a stack 13, i.e. figures 1-6 . The plates 12 are mutually sealed by intermediary gaskets 15 at their neighbouring surfaces, typically close to their edges 14 or periphery, i.e. figure 5 . The ""mass flow side"" of the heat exchanger is disclosed in figure 4 . The arrows C represents the flow of the chocolate. The common first inlet 18 and the common first outlet 19 for the mass, are disclosed in figure 4 in a simplified manner as blank holes. By studying figures 5 and 6 it is clearly seen, that the inlet 18 and outlet 19 for the mass are created by the holes in the plates.     [0029]    The ""water flow side"" of the cooling stage heat exchanger is disclosed in figure 6a . In greater detail and in simplified view are in figure 6b disclosed the intermediary, neighbouring channels 16, 17 between the plates 12.     [0030]    Every second channel 16 in the row of plates 12 are connected with the common first inlet 18 and the common first outlet 19 for the flow of mass there through. Each of the intermittent, neighbouring channels 17 are connected with a common second inlet 20 and a common second outlet 21 for the flow of water there through.     [0031]    The figures 3-6 are schematic drawings focused on disclosing the principal build-up of the inventive cooling stage in terms of understanding the inventive solution. Especially may the number of plates 12 in practice deviate from the disclosed numbers.     [0032]    The plates 12 are disclosed as being planar. However, they can have several other forms such as being corrugated or other types of depressions, as long as the mass is flowing simultaneously in a row of parallel streams being cooled by intermittent water channels through the heat exchanger.     [0033]    At figure 3 , the stack of plates 13 is arranged in a cubic box 22 made up of side panels 23-28, which provide for easy cleaning on the outside of the heat exchanger. However, many configurations are possible as long as the intermittent, neighbouring channels for mass and water are available. The stack of plates and intermittent gaskets may for example be arranged on bars and squeezed together, so the channels between the plates thereby are kept tight. Side panels are then not necessary.     [0034]    The common first inlet 18 is connected with a mass inlet tube part 29 at one side 26 of the heat exchanger 11. The common first outlet 19 is connected with a mass outlet tube part 30 at the other side 28 of the exchanger 11, i.e. figures 3 and 4 .     [0035]    As disclosed in figures 3 and 6 is the common second inlet 20 connected with a water inlet tube part 31 arranged at the side 28 of the exchanger 11. The common second outlet 21 is connected with a water outlet tube part 32 arranged at the opposite side 26 of the exchanger 11. The arrows W depict the flow directions of the water. With this embodiment, the mass and the water are in counter-flow in the heat exchanger 11 providing a highly effective heat transfer between the mass and the colder water. The water inlet tube part 31 and the water outlet tube part 32 are adapted to be connected with a circuit of temperature regulated water, which is not disclosed, as it is not part of the invention as such. Important only, is that the circuit continuously delivers water flow to the inlet tube part 31, so that the heat exchanger is controlled to the desired extent or level for the temperature of the mass leaving the exchanger through the mass outlet tube part 30.     [0036]    A mass pump 33 is connected to the mass inlet tube part 29 as disclosed in figure 2 . The pump 33 is to its suction side adapted to be connected with a non-disclosed conduit leading mass to the pump from a tank or other supply of mass. The mass outlet tube part 30 at the other side of the cooling stage heat exchanger 11, is via a mass conduit 34 connected with the column 2. A temperature measurement unit 35 is arranged in the conduit 34 and is wired 36 to a control screen 37, which in this embodiment comprises a CPU or other process control unit. A mass outlet conduit 38 from the column comprises a second temperature measurement unit 39, which is also wired 40 to the control screen 37. A dotted line 41 represents the housing of the apparatus 1 in which the control screen 37 is arranged. In figure 1 is the control screen 37 shown in its correct position in the housing 41, however, in figure 2 the screen 37 is depicted schematically above the housing 41 for the sake of clarity.     [0037]    During production the pump 33 runs continuously, so that the mass is feed from a storage tank and to the cooling stage heat exchanger 11. When the mass is a chocolate mass recipe it is heated in the storage tank to a temperature of 45-50 C. The mass is then free from any crystals as the temperature is then well above the highest melting temperature for crystals available in solid chocolate mass.     [0038]    In a liquid state is the mass pumped into the common first inlet 18, in which it is being split into several streams when entering each second channel 16, i.e. figures 4-6 . The mass is then flowing simultaneously in a row of parallel streams through the channels 16 to be mixed again in the common first outlet 19.Simultaneously, water is pumped to the common second inlet 20, in which it is being split into several streams by entering each second, intermittent, neighboring channel 17. Flowing through the parallel channels 17 the water is heat-exchanging with the mass in the channels 16, where after the water streams are mixed again in the common second outlet 21, i.e. figure 6 .     [0039]    The mass channels 16 of the inventive cooling stage heat exchanger 11 are free from any intermediary scrapers, discs or wings moving through the chambers such as being common in the cooling stages of the prior columns. The channels 16 are slim, having a width of 1-10 mm, in comparison to the extension of the plates 12. The row of the many parallel channels 16 ensure, that the mass is split into several ""plate-like"" streams, which are simultaneously exposed to accurately the same cooling conditions exercised by each of the intermittent, neighboring water channels 17. When mass from each of the channels 16 are mixed again in the common first outlet 19, it is completely homogenous and is having the same temperature in all parts of the mass flow. In the cooling stages of the prior art columns the mass flow is mixed and cooled differently during its passage through the successive, serially connected mass chambers in the elements. The surface temperatures and mixing intensity of a particular mass chamber varies from center to periphery which provides for in-homogenous mass in a cooling stage.     [0040]    In the embodiment disclosed, the channels have a width of 3 mm, so that the mass flows through the parallel channels 16 as parallel sheets or like thick pages in a big book.     [0041]    The temperature of the uniform and homogenous mass leaving the common first outlet 19 of the cooling stage heat exchanger 11, is controlled sharply within tenths of a degree. A desired mass temperature is pre-set at the control screen 37, and is measured continuously by the mass temperature measurement unit 35 extending into the mass in the conduit 34, which is connecting the outlet 19 and the crystallization stage in the column 2. The CPU or computer of the control screen 37 then controls the cooling water temperature and flow continuously being delivered to the common second inlet 20. The control is in accordance with the obtained mass temperature received from the unit 35, so that the cooling stage 11 removes the necessary heat from the mass for obtaining the desired pre-set mass temperature in the conduit 35.     [0042]    Depending on the temperature, at which crystals are created in the particular mass, the pre-set temperature to be obtained at the unit 35 could be set slightly above the crystal-creation temperature. When the mass is a certain recipe of milk chocolate, the temperature could be set to 27C at the unit 35. The crystal-creation temperature is 26,5C.     [0043]    A desired output temperature for the ready crystallized mass to be obtained at the second temperature measurement unit 39, is also pre-set via the control screen 37. For the particular recipe of milk chocolate, it could for example be 26C. The water circuit of the column 2 is controlled automatically, so that when the water flow through the chambers 5 of the elements, the mass is cooled accurately enough for obtaining the desired pre-set temperature when it is leaving the crystallization column through the output conduit 38. The gear motor 8 continuously revolves the shaft 7 with the mixing propels 10, thereby mixing the created crystals up into the mass.     [0044]    At the specific apparatus being used for tempering of milk chocolate mass, the inventive apparatus according to figures 1-6 has a maximum capacity of 4000 kg of milk chocolate per hour. When orientated as in figures 1 and 2 , the cooling stage heat exchanger 11 has the dimensions of width: 500 mm and height: 250 mm. The horizontal depth of the exchanger 11 is measured in the stacking direction of the plates 12. It is 300 mm when 35 plates 12 are stacked with an average width of each of the channels 16 or 17 of 3 mm. The total effective heat exchange area of the plates 12 are then around 8 m2.     [0045]    The crystallization stage column 2 constitutes of four elements 3 each having a diameter of 650 mm.     [0046]    Due to the parallel cooling provided in the inventive cooling stage heat exchanger, it is possible to provide a uniform and homogenous mass, that can be controlled sharply in temperature. Creation of any crystals and especially undesirable, lower melting crystals such as IV-crystals and -crystals in chocolate mass are then avoided though the mass is cooled to a temperature within tenth of a degree above the highest crystals creation temperature for the particular mass.In the present example of the inventive apparatus according to figures 1-6 , the crystallization stage column 2 is further controllable to such extent, that the milk chocolate mass is kept homogenous, and only a slight temperature lowering of 0,5-1,0C through the column 2 is obtained. The desirable, stable V-crystals are then created in the mass, however, lower melting, unstable crystals are avoided. It is then possible to avoid any re-heating stage on top of the crystallization stage of the column for melting out again such undesirable and unstable crystals.     [0047]    In figure 10 is schematically disclosed a prior art column 42 having a maximum capacity of tempering 4000 kg milk chocolate per hour. The column 42 has a cooling stage 43 of 5 elements height, a crystallization stage 44 of 4 elements height and a re-heating stage 45 of 2 elements height. A total of 11 elements constitute the height of the column 42. In the cooling stage 43 are the mass and the water in counter-flow, and the water is cold, typically 10-14C for providing the necessary cooling effect on the mass with that capacity. Different types of crystals are then created in especially chocolate mass, such as the milk chocolate mass. Consequently, the re-heating stage 45 is necessary to melt out the undesirable, lower melting crystals again.     [0048]    To the difference from the 11 elements height of the prior art column 42, the column 2 of the inventive apparatus 46 only requires a column having a height of 4 elements. The building height and the center of gravity of the inventive apparatus 46 is then much lower than for the prior art column 42 as seen in figure 10 .     [0049]    In figure 7 is disclosed the inventive apparatus 47 having all the parts of the apparatus 1 of figures 1-6 . Furthermore, is under the housing 41 arranged a further inventive heat exchanger 48, which is used for heating up the supplied mass to a crystal-free temperature before entering the cooling stage heat exchanger 11. By the prior art columns 42, such pre-heating stage is arranged with even further elements 3 in front of the cooling stage 43, i.e. at the bottom of the column 42 in figure 10 . The column then grows in height and becomes even more difficult to handle and transport.     [0050]    The innovative heat exchanger 48 providing the pre-heating stage is arranged at the support 9 and preserves the low center of gravity. A further temperature measurement unit 49 is arranged in the tube-connection between the heat exchangers 48 and 11. The unit 49 is wired 50 to the control screen 37, so that the mass temperature is controlled to a desired level, such as 45-50C for chocolate mass before entering the cooling stage exchanger 11.     [0051]    In figure 8 and 9 are disclosed another embodiment 50 of the inventive apparatus. In in excess to the apparatus 1 of figures 1-6 , the apparatus 50 of figures 8 , 9 has an upper re-heating stage 51 arranged in further elements 3 on top of the column 2 of figures 1 and 2 .The column 52 of the tempering apparatus 50 then constitutes both a crystallization stage 53 and a re-heating stage 51 upon that. A further temperature measurement unit 54 is inserted in between the crystallization stage 53 and the re-heating stage 51 and is wired to the control screen 37. This embodiment is necessary when it is not possible to avoid undesirable crystals in the mass during its passage through the crystallization stage 53 of the column 52. The pre-set temperature to be achieved at the unit 39 is then set to be slightly higher than the temperature to be achieved at the unit 54 after the crystallization stage. The temperature could typically be 0,5-1,0C higher at the unit 39 than at the unit 54. The height of the column 52 is disclosed in figure 10 for comparison with the much higher prior art column 42.1: : apparatus for continuous tempering2: : column3: : cast-iron element4: : mass chamber5: : water chamber6: : gasket7: : shaft8: : gear motor9: : frame or support10: : mixing elements11: : plate heat exchanger12: : plates13: : stack of plates14: : edges of plates15: : gaskets16: : mass channels17: : water channels18: : common first inlet for mass19: : common first outlet for mass20: : common second inlet for water21: : common second outlet for water22: : cubic box23-28: : side panels29: : mass inlet tube part30: : mass outlet tube part31: : water inlet tube part32: : water outlet tube part33: : mass pump34: : mass conduit35: : temperature measurement unit36: : electrical wire37: : control screen38: : mass outlet conduit39: : temperature measurement unit40: : electrical wire41: : housing42: : prior art tempering column43: : cooling stage44: : crystallization stage45: : re-heating stage46: : inventive apparatus47: : inventive tempering apparatus48: : heat exchanger49: : temperature measurement unit50: : another embodiment of tempering apparatus51: : re-heating stage52: : column53: : crystallization stage54: : temperature measurement unit55: : wiring","                                                                                                                                                                        1.

TECHNICAL FIELD    [0002]    Embodiments of the present invention relate to network information security technologies, and specifically to a method, apparatus and storage medium for defending against malicious clicks.     BACKGROUND    [0003]    With the rise of the Internet advertisement and marketing promotion, increasingly more Internet companies have started online promotional services. There are numerous means for the Internet companies to charge businesses for the online promotional services, including view-based pay, click-based pay and result-based pay, and the click-based pay is currently the most popular and widely used. However, the click-based pay has problems of false or intentional malicious clicks driven by various motives. As a result, the business' promotional costs may increase sharply. At the same time, the advertisement publisher, in particular, an alliance member of the advertisement publishers, reaps additional profits.     [0004]    A typical situation is a business pays for the opportunities to display promotional content at a search website, and when Internet users click the promotional content, the search website charges the business according to the number of clicks. Due to market competition, a competitor of the business, or an Internet user with a malicious intent towards the business, may on his own or cause others to search and click the business's promotional content. If there is no effective prevention mechanism, the business's promotional costs will increase sharply and the business's customer service and consultation resources will be occupied.     [0005]    A current widely adopted conventional method for defending against malicious clicks is to judge click activities and parameters at the back end of a server, to determine whether or not malicious clicks have occurred, and then to process the detected malicious clicks as no charge in a click log.     [0006]    This conventional method has some major shortcomings: (1) after-the-fact, the back-end filtering can only deal with malicious clicks that have occurred by reversibly non-charging or refunding the business, and cannot prevent them at their sources; and (2) poor timeliness, when the malicious clicks occur, this method cannot quickly respond to prevent the clicks in real time, such that these malicious activities will occupy the business's promotion and customer service resources.     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION    [0007]    The embodiments of the present invention provide a method, apparatus and storage medium for defending against malicious clicks, to timely prevent malicious clicks on promotional content.     [0008]    In a first aspect, the embodiments of the present invention provide a method for defending against malicious clicks, including:acquiring a shielding policy corresponding to promotional content;determining a user in a shielding policy list as the user to be shielded based on the shielding policy and historical click information of users; andif the user to be shielded in the shielding policy list conducts a retrieval, performing shielding processing on the promotional content for the user to be shielded.    [0009]    In a second aspect, the embodiments of the present invention provide an apparatus for defending against malicious clicks, including:a service module, wherein the service module includes a shielding policy acquisition unit, which is configured to acquire a shielding policy corresponding to promotional content;an anti-fraudulence module, wherein the anti-fraudulence module includes a shielded user determination unit, which is configured to determine a user in a shielding policy list as the user to be shielded based on the shielding policy and historical click information of users; anda retrieval shielding module, which is configured to perform shielding processing on the promotional content for the user to be shielded if the user to be shielded in the shielding policy list conducts a retrieval.    [0010]    In a third aspect, the embodiments of the present invention provide a non-volatile computer storage medium, the non-volatile computer storage medium storing one or more modules, wherein when the one or more modules are executed by an apparatus that performs methods for defending against malicious clicks, the apparatus is activated to perform the following operations of:acquiring a shielding policy corresponding to promotional content;determining a user in the shielding policy list as the user to be shielded based on the shielding policy and historical click information of users; andif the user to be shielded in the shielding policy list conducts a retrieval, performing shielding processing on the promotional content for the user to be shielded.    [0011]    According to the technical solutions provided by the embodiments of the present invention, malicious clicks are prevented at the stage of displaying promotional content in a front end of a server.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION    [0013]    The technical solution in the embodiments of the present invention will be clearly and completely described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is apparent that the embodiments to be described are only a part rather than all of the embodiments of the present invention, and are intended to describe the principle of the present invention instead of limiting the present invention to the specific embodiments. All other embodiments derived by those of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present invention without making creative efforts will fall within the protection scope of the present invention.     First Embodiment    [0014]    FIG. 1 is a flow chart of a method for defending against malicious clicks according to a first embodiment of the present invention, which method may be performed by an apparatus for defending against malicious clicks implemented by means of hardware and/or software. Generally, the apparatus is configured in a server that provides search services in order to defend against malicious click activities in real time. FIG. 2 is a schematic structural diagram of an apparatus for defending against malicious clicks applicable to the embodiments of the present invention. A preferred architecture of the apparatus includes a service module, an anti-fraudulence module, a retrieval shielding module and a data statistics module. The method will be described below in combination with the architecture of the apparatus. However, those skilled in the art should understand that apparatuses that may perform the defending method according to the embodiment of the present invention should not be limited to the present one employing the architecture as described herein.     [0015]    The method for defending against malicious clicks according to the embodiment includes the following.     [0016]    S110, acquiring a shielding policy corresponding to promotional content.     [0017]    This operation may be implemented by the service module, which provides an interface for a business user who sets up the promotional content, and may acquire a shielding policy independently set by the business user. The business user may set a uniform shielding policy for all of the promotional content, or different shielding policies respectively for different promotional content. The business user may flexibly adjust the shielding policy or policies before or during the course of promoting the promotional content.     [0018]    The shielding policy preferably includes a policy name, an effective range, an effective time, a threshold of the click number and other items. The policy name is configured to distinguish different policies, and is used as a unique identification of a policy. The effective range is configured to clarify whether the shielding policy is effective for all promotional content or only for certain promotional content of the business user. The effective time is configured to determine the time interval of a click condition monitored by the shielding policy, for example, 15 minutes, 1 hour or 6 hours, and different shielding policies may be set up with different time ranges. The business user may set a threshold of the number of clicks according to the past click condition of the promotional content. If the same retrieval user clicks the promotional content within the effective range in the effective time more than the threshold of the number of clicks, the retrieval user hits the shielding policy. The business user generates a shielding policy after setting the above parameters, and the shielding policy may be transmitted to the anti-fraudulence module through data streams, in order to distinguish the identified retrieval user.     [0019]    S120, determining a user in a shielding policy list as the user to be shielded according to the shielding policy and historical click information of users.     [0020]    This operation is implemented by the anti-fraudulence module, which processes click data streams on an on-going basis and may acquire historical click information of a retrieval user in real time from the search log of a search engine. The historical click information may include a retrieval user, retrieval time, information including the promotional content and the number of clicks displayed in a retrieval result, and it is mainly configured to enable the anti-fraudulence module to gather statistics on clicking the promotional content by the retrieval user.     [0021]    It is possible to identify whether a retrieval user satisfies the shielding policy based on the historical click information of the user. The retrieval user that satisfies the shielding policy is the user to be shielded corresponding to the promotional content set by the business user, and may be added into a shielding policy list to form a mapping relationship with the business user or with part of his promotional content. For example of the above preferred shielding policy, the operation of S120 may be specified as follows: according to the historical click information, determining a user in line with the effective range, effective time and threshold of the number of clicks in the shielding policy as the user to be shielded, and adding the user into the shielding policy list. The shielding policy list is transferred to the retrieval shielding module by the anti-fraudulence module in real time and comes into effect immediately.     [0022]    The user to be shielded may be differentiated by using an IP, an account identification (cookie), a unique visitor identification or the like to recognize the identity, and the user to be shielded may be a single user or a user group such as all users in a certain IP sub-network. The unique visitor identification is a unique user identification that is determined based on various information of the retrieval user as long as the identification may uniquely identify the retrieval user. For example, it may be an identification combining his IP and account information.     [0023]    S130, shielding the promotional content from the user to be shielded if the user to be shielded in the shielding policy list conducts a retrieval.     [0024]    This operation may be performed by the retrieval shielding module. The retrieval shielding module is configured to provide retrieval services for each retrieval user. In this embodiment, the retrieval shielding module acquires the shielding policy list from the anti-fraudulence module, treats the retrieval user as the one making malicious clicks when it monitors that a retrieval user is the user to be shielded in the shielding policy list, and performs a shielding process, thus preventing the user making malicious clicks from continuously clicking the promotional content of the business user before the promotional content is displayed.     [0025]    The operation of performing the shielding processing to shield the promotional content for the user to be shielded preferably includes:prohibiting displaying the promotional content for the user to be shielded; orexchanging the promotional content with replacement content, and displaying the replacement content to the user to be shielded.    [0026]    On one hand, performing the shielding processing on the promotional content may directly prohibit displaying the corresponding promotional content. On the other hand, it may also display a substitute solution rather than the promotional content. That is, the shielding processing prohibits the promotional content from being displayed to the retrieval user, and at the same time it searches the replacement content of the promotional content, which may be the promotional content of other business users similar to the current promotional content, or content beneficial to the public, and displays the replacement content to the user to be shielded. This kind of replacement still meets the search needs of Internet users and promotion needs of other business users.     [0027]    According to the technical solution of the embodiment of the present invention, malicious clicks are prohibited at the front end of the server before the promotional content is displayed. On one hand, it is possible to determine malicious clicks based on the real-time click information and conduct timely and effective defense, thus improving timeliness of the defense. On the other hand, the shielding policy may be set by the business users, thus improving the business users' autonomy on controlling malicious clicks. In addition, the solution considers Internet users' experience as it does not need to take measures such as imposing resource occupation against those Internet users who make malicious clicks. Further by providing the replacement content, this technical solution may also meet the shielding demands of the business user against the Internet users and the promotion demands of other business users that need to display promotional content. Therefore, this solution achieves a tripartite win.     [0028]    With the rise of the Internet marketing promotion and advertisement, more and more modes of click-based pay are generated, not only on search promotions but also on Internet alliance promotions, video pre-movie adverts, and the like. As long as the payment is click-based, it will encounter malicious click problems, and such problems will directly threaten the foundation of the click-based pay business. Therefore, the new method for defending against malicious clicks according to the embodiment of the present invention may effectively prevent the malicious clicks before they occur, protects the benefits of the businesses and the promotion platforms, and thus enhances the customers' return on investment (ROI), degree of satisfaction and long-term sound development of the promotion platforms.     Second Embodiment    [0029]    FIG. 3 is a flow chart of a method for defending against malicious clicks according to a second embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment makes an optimization and improvement on the above technical solution, and further comprises a technical measure of defending against malicious clicks through a manual shielding list. That is, on the basis of the foregoing embodiment, this embodiment further includes the following steps.     [0030]    S310, acquiring a manual shielding list corresponding to the promotional content.     [0031]    The operation of acquiring a manual shielding list may also be performed by the service module. The business user may set a retrieval user as the one to be shielded according to his/her judgement that this retrieval user should be shielded, using an IP, account information (Cookie), a unique visitor identification or the like as the identity recognition of the retrieval user. When the retrieval user is set as the user to be shielded by the business user, the manual shielding list is formed, and the list is directly transmitted to the retrieval shielding module through data streams, and configured to shield the promotional content from the retrieval user. The user to be shielded in the manual shielding list may be effective for all or part of the promotional content of the business user.     [0032]    S320, performing a shielding processing to shield the promote content for the user to be shielded if a user to be shielded in the manual shielding list conducts a retrieval on the promotional content.     [0033]    The operation may be performed by the retrieval shielding module, and the operations based on the manual shielding list are similar to that according to the shielding policy list.     [0034]    The technical solution of this embodiment achieves effects of policy-based shielding and manual shielding. The business user may further manually add a designated Internet user as the user to be shielded, so that the Internet user cannot retrieve the promotional content of the business user.     Third Embodiment    [0035]    FIG. 4 is a flow chart of a method for defending against malicious clicks according to the third embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment further includes a solution of feeding back the execution condition of the shielding processing on the basis of the above embodiments. This embodiment may still be performed by the apparatus for defending against malicious clicks as shown in FIG. 2 .     [0036]    This embodiment further provides the following steps in the method according to the foregoing embodiments:S410, recording the execution condition data of the shielding process.    [0037]    This operation may be performed by the anti-fraudulence module, which, while forming the shielding policy list, records the execution condition data of the shielding process, for example, a shielding policy list that records hits according to the shielding policy, the number of times the promotional content is shielded when the user to be shielded conducts a retrieval, and the like.     [0038]    S420, feeding back and displaying the execution condition data upon a query request.     [0039]    This operation may be performed by the data statistics module. The data statistics module is an optional module, configured to effectively analyze and store the execution condition data of the shielding processing performed by the anti-fraudulence module and store the data reports obtained after analyzing the data. When the service module receives a query request from the business user, the data statistics module retrieves the statistical information, displays the data to the user with a visual chart, and guides the business user regarding the data disclosure and related configuration.     [0040]    Based on the technical solution provided by the embodiment of the present invention, after the business user sets a shielding policy or a manual shielding list, the subsequent Internet users' detailed information and statistical data hit by the shielding policy, and the manual shielding list may be viewed through the service module. Upon receipt of a view request from the business user, the service module will initiate a data query request to the data statistics module, the data statistics module then returns a corresponding statistical report to the service module, displays the report information to the business user through a visual chart and facilitates the business user to evaluate the usefulness of the shielding policy.     Fourth Embodiment    [0041]    FIG. 5 is a flow chart of a method for defending against malicious clicks according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment adds a solution of feeding back the execution condition of the shielding processing on the basis of the above embodiments. This embodiment may still be performed by the apparatus for defending against malicious clicks as shown in FIG. 2 .     [0042]    This embodiment further includes the following steps on the basis of the methods according to the foregoing embodiments:S510, recording the execution condition data of the shielding process; andS520, calculating a filtering ration between the traffic of the shielding processing and the display traffic of the promotional content.    [0043]    This operation may be performed by the anti-fraudulence module. For example, according to the execution condition data, it is possible to conduct a strategically and newly shielded Internet user statistics on a daily basis, which data is imported into the data statistics module for query by the service module. The daily strategically and newly shielded Internet user statistics means that, on a daily basis, the occurrences that the promotional content is shielded from a retrieval user are recorded as the traffic of the shielding process, the occurrences that the promotional content are displayed on the same date is recorded as the display traffic, and a ratio between the two traffics is calculated as the filtering ratio. The statistical information on the daily filtering ratio may be transmitted to the data statistics module through data streams for processing by the subsequent module.     [0044]    S530, generating, feeding back and displaying a shielding policy setting proposal based on the filtering ratio.     [0045]    The data statistics module may generate a proposal according to the filtering ratio. For example, when the filtering ratio is greater, it indicates that most promotional content is shielded from being displayed and the setting of the shielding policy may be too strict, and it may propose to increase the identification threshold for malicious clicks and reduce the number of users to be shielded. This proposal may be transmitted to the service module from the data statistics module, as a feed back to the business user.     [0046]    The technical solution of this embodiment can provide more data support for the business user to configure the shielding policies, resulting in a better match between the setting of the shielding policy and the defense against the malicious clicks.     [0047]    The two solutions that the anti-fraudulence module cooperates with the data statistics module for recording and feedback respectively provided in the third and fourth embodiments may be adopted separately, but preferentially adopted jointly.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION     Disposable test kits such as home pregnancy test kits or laboratory test kits using bodily fluids such as urine or blood to detect or diagnose disease or other medical conditions are in common use throughout the world. Such test kits typically comprise a test strip sealed in a moisture barrier packaging before use in order to keep the test strip stable and protected during storage and transportation, to extend the shelf life of the test kit. The moisture barrier packaging typically comprises a foil bag or pouch. The test strip may additionally be encased in a plastic cassette for easier handling by the end user, in which case the test strip and cassette are both sealed in the moisture barrier bag before use. Where the test kit includes a cassette, the cassette is typically provided with an open reaction window that allows one or more test lines on the test strip to be viewed during use. Depending on the method of fluid analyte collection that the test strip is designed for, the cassette is configured accordingly to allow a sample collection portion of the test strip to receive the fluid analyte either via a drop collection or dipstick/mid-stream collection method.     As disposable test kits are used in great quantities internationally, there is a need to provide them at as low a cost and as conveniently as possible, particularly in order to benefit those in impoverished circumstances. In epidemic situations, there is also a need to ensure that tests can be safely and effectively performed, and results effectively captured and stored.     SUMMARY OF INVENTIO     According to a first aspect, there is provided a disposable test kit comprising a base sheet; a sealing sheet having at least one sealed sample collection opening before use of the test kit; at least one test strip sealed between the base sheet and the sealing sheet before use of the test kit; and at least one top sheet layered over the sealing sheet before use of the test kit to keep the at least one sample collection opening sealed, the at least one top sheet further configured to be at least partially detached from the sealing sheet to open the at least one sample collection opening and expose a sample collection portion of the at least one test strip for receiving a fluid analyte thereon during use of the test kit.     l The at least one sample collection opening and the sample collection portion may be configured to allow the fluid analyte to be received by the sample collection portion via one of: a dipstick method, a drop method and a mid-stream collection method. The sample collection opening may be sealed by a cover before use of the test kit, the cover being attached to the top sheet such that at least partially detaching the top sheet from the sealing sheet detaches the cover from the sealing sheet to open the sample collection opening. The at least one test strip may be at least one of: a lateral flow test strip and a dipstick test strip.     The at least one test strip is at least one dipstick test strip and the sample collection portion comprises at least one test pad impregnated with a reagent. The sealing sheet may further comprise at least one transparent portion configured as a reaction window and wherein the at least one test strip is at least one lateral flow test strip having at least one test line viewable through the reaction window.     Alternatively, the at least one top sheet may further comprise at least one transparent portion aligned with the reaction window of the sealing sheet. The base sheet, the sealing sheet and the at least one top sheet may each comprise a moisture barrier polymeric film.     The test kit may require no additional moisture barrier packaging to keep the at least one test strip stable during storage of the test kit before use.     The test kit may comprise at least one quick response code provided thereon for storing information therein.     The at least one top sheet may be configured to be reattachable to the sealing sheet to cover the at least one sample collection opening after use of the test kit to prevent the fluid analyte on the sample collection portion from coming into contact with another object.     The at least one top sheet may comprise a first top sheet layered over the sealing sheet and configured to keep the sample collection opening sealed before use of the test kit, the first top sheet having a drop collection opening sealed before use of the test kit and a second top sheet layered over the first top sheet and configured to keep the drop collection opening sealed before use of the test kit, wherein the first top sheet is further configured to be at least partially detached from the sealing sheet to open the sample collection opening of the sealing sheet and expose the sample collection portion of the test strip for receiving a fluid analyte thereon via one of: a dipstick method and a mid-stream collection method during use of the test kit, and wherein the second top sheet is further configured to be at least partially detached from the first top sheet to open the drop collection opening on the first top sheet and expose the sample collection portion for receiving a fluid analyte thereon via a drop method during use of the test kit, thereby providing a user of the test kit with a choice of which of the first top sheet and the second top sheet to detach according to how the user prefers the fluid analyte to be received by the test kit.     The test kit may comprise a plurality of test panels each comprising a test strip having a sample collection portion and individually sealed between the base sheet and the sealing sheet before use of the test kit, the sealing sheet having a plurality of sealed sample collection openings before use of the test kit, each sample collection opening configured to be opened by at least partially detaching the at least one top sheet from the sealing sheet to expose each sample collection portion during use of the test kit. The plurality of test panels may be configured to perform a different immunoassay.     The test kit may comprise at least one line of perforations provided therethrough and located between two adjacent test panels to allow at least one of the plurality of test panels to be manually separated from the test kit.     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES     In order that the invention may be fully understood and readily put into practical effect there shall now be described by way of non-limitative example only exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the description being with reference to the accompanying illustrative drawings.

Fig. 8 is an exploded assembly illustration of the test kit of Fig. 7 before use.     DETAILED DESCRIPTION     Exemplary embodiments of the disposable test kit 10 will be described below with reference to Figs. 1 to 7. Same reference numerals are used throughout the figures to denote the same or similar parts of the test kit 10 among the different embodiments. s shown in Figs. 1 and 2, in a first embodiment, the disposable test kit 10 is a dipstick test kit and comprises a base sheet 20, a sealing sheet 30 having a sealed sample collection 31 opening before use of the test kit 10, a dipstick test strip 40 sealed between the base sheet 20 and the sealing sheet 30 before use of the test kit 10, and a top sheet 50. The top sheet 50 is configured to be attached to the sealing sheet 30 before use of the test kit 10 to keep the sample collection opening 31 sealed. The base sheet 20, sealing sheet 30 and top sheet 50 are preferably rectilinear in shape and of the same size so that the disposable test kit 10 is a simple, almost flat rectangular package.     As shown in Fig. 2, the top sheet 50 is further configured to be at least partially detached from the sealing sheet 30 to open the sample collection opening 31 during use of the test kit 10. When the sample collection opening 31 has been opened, a sample collection portion 41 of the dipstick test strip 40 is exposed through the sample collection opening 31 and can then receive a fluid analyte thereon. This may be achieved by layering the top sheet 50 over the sealing sheet 30 and providing the top sheet 50 with appropriately located die cut lines 57 (e.g. on at least one side of the sample collection opening 31 ) to allow the top sheet 50 to be at least partially peeled away from the sealing sheet 30.     The sample collection opening 31 is preferably sealed by a cover 38 before use of the test kit 0. The cover 38 is attached to the top sheet 50 such that at least partially detaching the top sheet 50 from the sealing sheet 30 detaches the cover 38 from the sealing sheet 30 to open the sample collection opening 31. The cover 38 is preferably integral with or part of the sealing sheet 30 before use of the test kit 10.     The top sheet 50 is preferably also configured to be reattachable to the sealing sheet 30 to cover the sample collection opening 31 after use of the test kit 10, in order to prevent the fluid analyte on the sample collection portion 41 from coming into contact with another object. This is a safety or hygiene feature to minimize or prevent human handlers of the used test kit. 10 from being contaminated by contaminants in the fluid analyte, and to minimize or prevent cross contamination with other used test kits 10. As a dipstick test kit 10, the sample collection portion 41 comprises at least one test pad 45 impregnated with a suitable reagent for reacting with various compounds in the fluid analyte, which may be a urine sample, for example. The sample collection opening 31 and sample collection portion 41 are configured to allow a fluid analyte to be received by the sample collection portion 41 via a dipstick or mid-stream method once the sample collection opening 31 has been opened by detaching the top sheet 50.     In a second embodiment as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the test kit 10 is a lateral flow test kit, therefore the test strip 40 is a lateral flow test strip having at least one test line 43, and preferably also at least one control line 47. In this embodiment, the sealing sheet 30 is provided with a transparent portion configured as a reaction window 33 aligned over the test line 43 and the control line 47 so that they 43, 47, can be seen through the reaction window 33. In this embodiment, as the top sheet 50 is layered over all of the sealing sheet 30, the top sheet 50 also comprises a transparent portion 53 aligned with the reaction window 33 of the sealing sheet 30 to allow the test line 43 and the control line 47 to be seen through both the sealing sheet 30 and the top sheet 50 layers. In an alternative embodiment, the top sheet 50 may be layered only partially over the sealing sheet 30 without being layered over the reaction window 33, in which case no transparent portion needs to be provided in the top sheet 50. Similar to the first embodiment, the second embodiment test kit also has a sample collection opening 31 in the sealing sheet 30 that is sealed before use of the test kit 10, and similarly opened by detaching the top sheet 50 from the sealing sheet 30.     The sample collection opening 31 and the sample collection portion 41 of the lateral flow test kit 10 are configured to allow the fluid analyte to be received by the sample collection portion 41 by various possible methods such as a dipstick method, a drop method and/or a midstream collection method depending on the type of fluid analyte to be collected and as already known in the art. For example, for an HIV test, the lateral flow test kit 10 will be configured to have the sample collection portion 41 receive blood via a drop method. As a pregnancy test, the lateral flow test kit 10 can be configured to have the sample collection portion 41 designed to collect urine via one or more of a drop collection, mid-stream collection or a dipstick method.     In a third embodiment as shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the test kit 10 is also a lateral flow test kit having a lateral flow test strip 40 and a reaction window 33, but configured to allow a user to select the sample collection method, i.e. via a dipstick or drop method. To that end, the sealing sheet 30 of the third embodiment is provided with two top sheets 51 , 52. The first top sheet 51 is layered over the sealing sheet 30, and is configured to keep the sample collection opening sealed 31 before use of the test kit. The first top sheet 51 is additionally provided with a drop collection opening 56 that is sealed before use of the test kit 10. The drop collection opening 56 is located to be aligned over part 46 of the sample collection opening 31 of the sealing sheet 30. The second top sheet 52 is layered over the first top sheet 51, and is configured to keep the drop collection opening 56 on the first top sheet 51 sealed before use of the test kit 10. The drop collection opening 56 is preferably sealed by a cover 58 before use of the test kit 10.     Similar to the first embodiment, in the third embodiment, the first top sheet 51 is further configured to be at least partially detached from the sealing sheet 30 to open the sample collection opening 31 of the sealing sheet 30 and expose the sample collection portion 41 of the test strip 40 for receiving a fluid analyte thereon via one of: a dipstick method and a midstream collection method during use of the test kit 10.     The second top sheet 52 is configured to be at least partially detached from the first top sheet 51 to open the drop collection opening 56 on the first top sheet 51 and expose part 46 of the sample collection portion 41 for receiving a fluid analyte thereon via a drop method during use of the test kit 10.     In the third embodiment, detaching the first top sheet 51 from the sealing sheet 30 also means that the second top sheet 52 is detached from the test kit 10 at the same time, since the second top sheet 52 is layered over the first top sheet 51. Since the test kit 10 of the third embodiment is a lateral flow test kit 10, it is preferably also provided with a transparent reaction window 33 in the sealing sheet 30 to allow the at least one test line 43 of the lateral flow test strip 40 to be viewed. The first top sheet 51 is only partially layered over the sealing sheet 30 without covering the reaction window 33 of the sealing sheet 30, so no transparent portion is provided in the first top sheet 51. Alternatively, if it is desired to layer the first top sheet 51 over all of the sealing sheet 30, the first top sheet 51 should accordingly be provided with a transparent portion 53 over the reaction window 33.     In a fourth embodiment of the test kit 10 as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the test kit 10 comprises a plurality of test panels 48L, 48D each comprising a test strip 40 individually sealed between the base sheet 20 and the sealing sheet 30 before use of the test kit 10. Each test strip 40 has a sample collection portion 41, and the sealing sheet 30 has a corresponding plurality of sealed sample collection openings 31 before use of the test kit 10. Each sample collection opening 31 is similar to the sample collection opening 31 of the second embodiment shown in Figs. 3 and 4, being configured to be opened to expose each sample collection portion 41 during use of the test kit by detaching the top sheet 50 from the sealing sheet 50. Each of the plurality of test panels 48L, 48D is configured to perform a different immunoassay. In this way, one test kit 10 can allow a number of different tests to be performed by providing multiple test panels 48 in a single convenient package. Each panel 48L, 48D may be configured similar to any one of the embodiments described above so that the plurality of test strips 40 may comprise any combination of lateral flow and/or dipstick test strips 40, depending on the tests that it is desired for the test kit 10 to comprise.     In the example of the fourth embodiment shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the test kit 10 comprises four lateral flow test panels 48L and one dipstick test panel 48D. For added convenience, a line of perforations 90 is provided through the test kit 10 between the dipstick test panel 48D and its adjacent lateral flow test panel 48L to allow the dipstick test panel 48D to be manually separated from the test kit. This allows a user to collect the fluid analyte sample using the dipstick test panel 48D via a mid-stream collecting method without getting the fluid analyte sample onto the other test panels 48L     It should be noted that in Figs. 4, 6, and 8 where the lateral flow test strip 40 can be seen, the test lines 43 and control lines 47 are made visible only for illustration purposes as they are in fact invisible before use of the test kit 10. For all embodiments, the base sheet 20, sealing sheet 30 and at least one top sheet 50 each preferably comprise a moisture barrier polymeric film so that the at least one test strip 40 is kept well sealed between the base sheet 20 and sealing sheet 30 before use of the test kit 10. In this way, the test kit 10 requires no additional moisture barrier packaging to keep the at least one test strip 40 stable during storage and transportation of the test kit 10 before use. This also greatly reduces the size of the test kit 10 and the space it takes up, which would have a significant impact particularly when test kits need to be moved in areas with poor transportation networks or accessibility. For example, a single healthcare worker going on foot to a remote location will be able to take with him or her a great many more of the test kits 10 of the present invention in a single hand-carry bag or case or even clothing pocket as compared to existing test kits with plastic cassettes in foil bags that would be significantly more bulky to carry. Doing away with the need for an additional moisture barrier foil bag and plastic cassette also significantly reduces the cost of the test kit 10 of the present invention, since each foil bag and each plastic cassette contributes to the total cost of each traditionally available test kit.     In addition, for all embodiments, the disposable test kit 10 of the present invention is preferably provided with at least one quick response (QR) code 80 on the test kit 10, more preferably located on the top sheet 50 for easy access. The at least one QR code 80 allows information such as manufacturing date, expiry date and source information of the at least one test strip 40 and the test kit 10 itself to be stored and retrieved, as well as allowing the test kit 10 to be associated or tagged with a single specific source of the fluid analyte. The specific source may be a patient or any other analyte supply, depending on the usage application of the test kit 10. The QR code is preferably located on a part 58 of the top sheet 50 where the part 58 of the top sheet 50 is never detached from the sealing sheet 30, or on a part of the sealing sheet 30 that is not overlayed by a top sheet 50 (depending on the configuration of the test kit 10). In this way, the quick response code 80 is never separated from the test strip 40 in the test kit 10 after use, and each test strip 40 can be correctly traced to its specific fluid analyte source.     For example, where the test kit 10 is used to diagnose presence of a disease in individuals of a large population of patients, having the quick response code 80 on each test kit 10 allows each test kit 10 to be indelibly and indubitably associated with only one specific patient, thereby minimizing or preventing mix-ups in test results from occurring. Where the test kit 10 has a panel form comprising multiple test panels, as described above in the fourth embodiment and as shown in Fig. 7, any test panel that is configured to be separable from the rest of the test kit 10 preferably has its own QR code to, ensure that each and every test panel can be traced to a specific fluid analyte source. As described in the various embodiments above, the present invention thus provides a low cost, low bulk disposable test kit 10 that can be easily associated with a specific analyte source or patient.     Whilst there has been described in the foregoing description exemplary embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the technology concerned that many variations in details of design, construction and/or operation may be made without departing from the present invention. For example, where the test kit is configured to comprise multiple test panels, multiple lines of perforations 90 may be appropriately provided to allow one or more test panels to be separated from the test kit. While it has been described that the base sheet, sealing sheet and top sheet are preferably made of a moisture barrier polymeric film, they may alternatively be made of appropriately laminated paper with sufficient moisture barrier properties required for stable storage of the test strips therein. It is further envisaged that in various embodiments of the test kit, the top sheet may or may not be layered over all of the sealing sheet so long as it is layered over the sample collection opening to keep the sample collection opening sealed before use of the test kit.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE      INVENTION     [0022]    Embodiments of a method of manufacturing an array substrate, a display substrate and a display device will be described hereinafter in detail with reference to the attached drawings.     [0023]    A method of manufacturing an array substrate is provided in an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in Fig. 1 , the method may specifically comprise the following steps:Step S101: forming a pattern of an active layer and a pattern of source and drain electrodes on a substrate;Step S102: forming a pattern of a first transparent electrode and a pattern of a passivation layer through a single patterning process; andStep S103: processing the substrate on which the pattern of the passivation layer is formed such that material of the passivation layer at least partially fills in a gap in the pattern of the first transparent electrode.    [0024]    In step S102, the first transparent electrode may be a pixel electrode, and forming the pattern of the first transparent electrode and the pattern of the passivation layer through a single patterning process may simplify the process for manufacturing the array substrate. Compared with a process in prior art in which two patterning processes are needed to form the pixel electrode and the passivation layer respectively, the method of manufacturing the array substrate provided in the embodiment of the present disclosure may form both the pattern of the pixel electrode and the pattern of the passivation layer through just a single patterning process with only one mask used, such that number of masks used in the process of manufacturing the array substrate can be reduced, and in turn, the process of manufacturing the array substrate is simplified, and thus, manufacturing cost for the array substrate can be reduced.     [0025]    To be noted that, the patterning process used in the method of manufacturing the array substrate provided by the embodiment of the present disclosure may include any patterning process, such as a process in which exposure with photoresist, development and etching are involved. This process may include steps of, but not limited to: applying photoresist; exposing with a mask; developing; and etching a film that is to be applied a pattern to form a corresponding pattern. Patterning processes that will be performed many times are not limited to including identical steps. For example, a patterning process for the passivation layer may include applying photoresist, exposing, developing and etching, while a patterning process for the transparent conductive layer may only include etching.     [0026]    In practice, the above step S102 may be realized in the following manner:forming a film of the transparent conductive layer and a film of the passivation layer in sequence, that is, the film of the transparent conductive layer 03 is firstly formed on the substrate on which the pattern of the active layer 01 and the pattern of source and drain electrode layer 02 are formed, as shown in Fig. 2a , then the film of the passivation layer is formed on the substrate on which the film of the transparent conductive layer 03 is formed;performing a patterning process on the film of the passivation layer to form the pattern of the passivation layer, that is, performing a patterning process on the substrate on which the film of the passivation layer is formed using a mask, so as to obtain the passivation layer 04 having a pattern, as shown in Fig. 2b ;performing a patterning process on the film of the transparent conductive layer 03 through the pattern of the passivation layer that is used as a mask, so as to form the pattern of the first transparent electrode 05, in other words, performing a patterning process on the film of the transparent conductive layer 03 through the passivation layer 04 having the pattern that is used as a mask to form the pattern of the first transparent electrode 05, so as to obtain the substrate having the pattern of the first transparent electrode 05 and the pattern of the passivation layer 04, as shown in Fig. 2c . As mentioned above, the first transparent electrode 05 may be a pixel electrode.    [0027]    Specifically, in the method of manufacturing the above array substrate according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, only one mask is used in the process of forming the pixel electrode and the passivation layer by performing the patterning process on the passivation layer to form the pattern of the passivation layer using the mask and performing a patterning process on the transparent conductive layer to form the pattern of the transparent conductive layer the passivation layer through using the pattern of the pattern of the passivation layer as a mask. Compared with a process in prior art in which two patterning processes are performed to form the pattern of the pixel electrode and the pattern of the passivation layer by using two masks respectively, the method of manufacturing the array substrate provided in the embodiment of the present disclosure may reduce the number of masks used in the process of manufacturing the array substrate, and in turn, simplify the process of manufacturing the array substrate, so as to reduce manufacturing cost for the array substrate.     [0028]    In the method of manufacturing the above array substrate according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, for example, in order to obtain the passivation layer that is insulative, the substrate on which the pattern of the passivation layer has been formed needs to be processed, such that the material of the passivation layer at least partially fills a gap in the pattern of the first transparent electrode. According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, an annealing process is performed on the substrate on which the pattern of the passivation layer is formed such that after the annealing process, the material of the passivation layer on the substrate at least partially fills the gap in the pattern of the first transparent electrode, as shown in Fig. 3 . According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the gap in the pattern of the first transparent electrode may be completely filled with the material of the passivation layer, such that the passivation layer is formed as an integrated layer, which may achieve insulation function. In practice, there are many methods for forming an integrated passivation layer, which will not be described and limited herein.     [0029]    According to another exemplary embodiment, the substrate on which the pattern of the passivation layer has been formed may be processed such that the material of the passivation layer partially fills the gap in the pattern of the first transparent electrode, as shown in Fig. 3b . In this embodiment, the material of the passivation layer 04 does not completely fill the gap in the pattern of the first transparent electrode 05, but leave a space forming a via-hole, and in this instance, the second transparent electrode 06 formed in a subsequent process may be functioned as the pixel electrode. The pixel electrode 06 may be connected with a drain electrode through the via-hole that is not completely filled with the material of the passivation layer 04, and the first transparent electrode 05 may be functioned as a common electrode for providing a voltage signal to the pixel electrode, so as to drive the pixel electrode to realize a picture displaying function. Such an embodiment will be described in detailed hereinafter.     [0030]    In an exemplary embodiment, the material of the passivation layer may be a resin material, or one or more of insulative materials such as silicon nitride, silicon dioxide, which is not specifically limited herein. When a resin material is used for the passivation layer, it can not only realize an insulation function, but also decrease a capacitance between the source and drain electrodes and the pixel electrode, so as to reduce a RC delay of the source and drain electrodes, and in turn, reduce power consumption of the array substrate. In practice, however, the material of the passivation layer may be any material having an insulating characteristic, which is not limited herein.     [0031]    According to an exemplary embodiment, the above mentioned annealing process on the substrate on which the pattern of the passivation layer is formed may specifically include: performing a heating process on the substrate on which the pattern of the passivation layer is formed in a circumstance where a temperature is in a range from 200 C to 250C. Upon heating, the material of the passivation layer melts and flows to fill the gap in the pattern of the passivation layer on the substrate where no material of the first transparent electrode exists.     [0032]    According to an exemplary embodiment, after the annealing process performed on the substrate on which the pattern of the passivation layer is formed, a thickness of the passivation layer is reduced to 80%. As the annealing process is constrained by a starting voltage, the thickness of the passivation layer shall not be too large, and usually, a thickness less than 1 m would be suitable. In the method of manufacturing the array substrate provided in the embodiment of the present disclosure, the thickness of the passivation layer is in a range from 0.5 m to 1 m, and during the annealing process, a period of time for the heating process is about 20 minutes to 60 minutes. In such a manner, through the annealing process performed on the pattern of the passivation layer, the material of the passivation layer may at least partially fill the gap in the pattern of the first transparent electrode.     [0033]    In the method of manufacturing the array substrate according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, after the substrate, on which the pattern of the passivation layer 04 has been formed, has been processed, the method may further include forming a pattern of the second transparent electrode 06, as shown in Fig. 4 . That is, a film of the transparent conductive layer is deposited on the substrate after the substrate has been annealed, and then a patterning process is performed on the film of the transparent conductive layer to form the second transparent electrode 06. According to an example, the second transparent electrode 06 formed thereby may be a common electrode. A detailed description of the process of forming the common electrode is omitted herein, as it is similar to that in prior arts. After the passivation layer has been formed on the substrate, the common electrode is formed on the passivation layer. When the array substrate is implemented in an actual product, the common electrode may transmit voltage signal(s) to the pixel electrode, driving the pixel electrode to realize a picture display function.     [0034]    According to an exemplary embodiment, the step of forming a pattern of the active layer and a pattern of the source and drain electrodes may include:forming a film of the active layer and a film of the source and drain electrodes on the substrate in sequence; andperforming a patterning process on the film of the active layer and the film of the source and drain electrodes with a mask, so as to form the pattern of the active layer and the pattern of the source and drain electrodes. In such a manner, the pattern of the active layer and the pattern of the source and drain electrodes may be formed through a single patterning process using a single mask, such that manufacturing process of the array substrate can be simplified, and in turn, manufacturing cost for the array substrate can be reduced.    [0035]    The method of manufacturing the array substrate according to the embodiment of the present disclosure may further include a step of forming a gate electrode.     [0036]    More specifically, the pattern of the gate electrode is formed firstly on the substrate, then the pattern of the active layer and the pattern of the source and drain electrodes are formed on the substrate on which the pattern of the gate electrode is formed. That is, before step S101, the pattern of the gate electrode is formed firstly on the substrate. In such a manner, a bottom gate type array substrate can be formed.     [0037]    Alternatively, the pattern of the gate electrode may be formed on the substrate on which the pattern of the active layer and the pattern of the source and drain electrodes are formed after step S101, such that a top gate type array substrate can be obtained.     [0038]    Thus, the method of manufacturing the array substrate provided by the present disclosure is adapted to manufacture not only a top gate type array substrate, but also a bottom gate type array substrate. Therefore, a corresponding manufacturing process may be provided according to practical requirements, and thus the method according to the embodiments can be widely implemented.     [0039]    In an exemplary embodiment, the method of manufacturing the array substrate provided by the present disclosure may include:1. forming the gate electrode 07 on the substrate through a patterning process, wherein the pattern of the gate electrode 07 formed is shown in Fig. 5a , in which the gate electrode 07 is connected with the gate line;2. forming a pattern of the active layer 01, a source electrode 021 and a drain electrode 022 on the substrate on which the pattern of the gate electrode 07 is formed through one single patterning process, wherein a data line 08 electrically connected with the source electrode 021 is formed while forming the source electrode 021;3. performing a via-hole formation process on the drain electrode 022 on the substrate on which the source electrode 021 and the drain electrode 022 are formed to form a via-hole 09 in the drain electrode 022 such that the drain electrode 22 is electrically connected with the first transparent electrode 05, as shown in Fig. 5c ;4. forming the pattern of the passivation layer 04 and the first transparent electrode 05 on the substrate through one single patterning process on the substrate on which the via-hole 09 is formed, wherein the process of forming the pattern of the passivation layer 04 and the first transparent electrode 05 may be performed with reference to the specific process of step S102 according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, which will not be repeated in detail herein;5. performing the annealing process on the substrate formed with the passivation layer 04 and the first transparent electrode 05 such that the material of the passivation layer at least partially fills the gap in the pattern of the first transparent electrode 05, as shown in Fig. 5d ;6. forming the second transparent electrode 06 on the substrate through a patterning process on the substrate that has been annealed, as shown in Fig. 5e .    [0040]    Specifically, as described above, in the method of manufacturing the array substrate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the pattern of the passivation layer 04 formed is used as a mask in the patterning process to form the first transparent electrode 05, such that the number of masks used in the process of manufacturing the array substrate can be reduced, and in turn, manufacturing process of the array substrate is simplified, thus, manufacturing cost of the array substrate can be reduced.     [0041]    Based on the same inventive concept, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a display substrate, which includes an array substrate manufactured through the above described method of manufacturing the array substrate according to the embodiments of the present invention. The concept or principle of the display substrate in terms of solving its technical problem is similar to the array substrate and thus will not be repeated herein.     [0042]    Based on the same inventive concept, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a display device, which may be used in a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a TV set, a notebook computer, a digital frame, a navigator or any product or component that has a display function. The principle of the display device in terms of solving its technical problem is similar to the array substrate and thus will not be repeated herein.     [0043]    Embodiments of the disclosure provide a method of manufacturing an array substrate, a display substrate and a display device. The method of manufacturing an array substrate includes: forming a pattern of an active layer and a pattern of source and drain electrodes on a substrate; forming a pattern of a first transparent electrode and a pattern of a passivation layer through one single patterning process; and processing the substrate on which the pattern of the passivation layer is formed such that a material of the passivation layer fills at least partially in a gap in the pattern of the first transparent electrode. The pattern of the first transparent electrode and the passivation layer are formed through one single patterning process such that the number of masks used in the manufacturing process of the array substrate is reduced. Compared with a process in prior art in which the pixel electrode and the passivation layer are obtained through two patterning processes respectively, the method of manufacturing the array substrate provided in the embodiment of the present disclosure may form both the pattern of the pixel electrode and the pattern of the passivation layer through just a single patterning process with only one mask, such that the number of masks used in the process of manufacturing the array substrate can be reduced, and in turn, the process of manufacturing the array substrate is simplified, thus, manufacturing cost for the array substrate can be reduced.     [0044]    Obvious, various changes and modifications may be made by those skilled in the art in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the disclosure, those changes and modifications shall fall within the scope of the disclosure if they fall within the scope defined in the claims and their equivalents.

The content is being generated individually for each requesting client in accordance with the client preferences, using predictive formatting for each end user. Therefore, the presentation of the content may differ for each user. In addition to dynamically generating content to be displayed to the user, the present solution includes Traffic Distribution System for re-distribution of invalid clicks.","Technical field     [0001]    The present solution relates to computer systems and methods for optimization of traffic distribution while providing digital content over a digital data network such as the world wide web.      Background     [0002]    In the past decades there has been a significant increase in the amount of digital information that is being generated, stored and served to end users over a world wide web. The end users access web with a variety of computing devices, such as, but not limited to, mobile phones, tablets and notebooks where available resources, such as memory and bandwidth may be limited. Digital content and in particular software applications for mobile devices are being developed for wide variety of purposes and downloaded by end users on their mobile devices. While the resources of the mobile computing devices are limited, the capacity of the web servers distributing such content and therefore accessed by said devices is limited as well. The volume of information that is being transferred over the networks and served to customers poses a technical problem of optimization of the data being transmitted and minimizing amount of traffic.     [0003]    In many cases it is the goal of the companies distributing digital content that only relevant end users would access the content. For example, there is no point for a software manufacturer if a user that does not in fact need the software would download a trial out of curiosity and never buys a full version. Nor there is a point to pay to a software distributor for marketing said content to such a client. One of the approaches taken in order to avoid such situations is user profiling.     [0004]    User profiling has been known in the art and has been used for customizing the content provided to a client. For example, one prior art document WO2015195671 discloses a method for selecting relevant information for display on a display screen of a mobile computing device by comparing a listing of past user activities and preferences to a stored informational content according to a detected proximity to a geographical location. The relevant content may be selected according to additional parameters, including a stored predetermined activity category, a stored geographical location of a creator of the informational content, and a time period at which the mobile device is determined to be proximal to the geographical location.     [0005]    Another prior art document US2015379411 (A1 ) discloses a model of preferences that displays certain types of time and history dependent dynamics. Creation and use of the model based on insights from studies in human psychology and gained from the exploration of real world temporal preference data. Particularly, the dynamics of satiation for familiar content are incorporated in the model by dynamic item preference states. In some examples, the model may identify different latent preference states for items, which are called the Sensitization, the Boredom, and the Recurrence states. Dynamics in a user's preferences for items may be attributed to the dynamics in these item states.     [0006]    Yet another prior art example US2015371274 (A1 ) provides an online advertisement system targeted to a publication medium (e.g., a website) based on a location of a user visiting the website, the content of the website and/or a location associated with the website content. Static and/or dynamic maps can be presented with the targeted advertisements on the website. The targeted advertisements can include a click-to-call link and/or other features for allowing a user to interact with and explore the targeted advertisement.     [0007]    While the companies producing media content face the problem of delivering the right content to the right customers, in some cases it is not possible to deliver the content only to the targeted group. In many cases the system just does not have enough information on the person at the time some content is already being shown. If such a non-target person interacts with the content, it may lead to unnecessary traffic and burden to the server providing the content. Additionally, content providers would like to increase attractiveness of their content for the target auditory.      Summary     [0008]    The present solution relates to a computer implemented method for optimization of traffic distribution between content providers and content consumers while providing digital content over a digital data network including:providing a first computer resource comprising a media content generating system configured to generate media content for an at least one second computer resource, said first and second computer resources being adapted and configured to communicate with each other at least temporarily via a network, and wherein said second computer resource is operated by an en user; determining, in the first computer resource, technical parameters and/or the end user parameters of the second computer resource; determining subset of media content entities for which the technical parameters and/or end user parameters satisfy selection criteria for the second computer resource and the end user; ranking media content based upon a probability that content is relevant to the end user; selecting a highest ranked media content entity and dynamically adapting formatting said media content in accordance with said determined parameters of the second computer resource and preferences of the end user, embedding said selected media content entity into said dynamic content plugin; and providing said selected media content entity embedded into a dynamic plugin to said second computer resource.    [0009]    The present solution may further comprise a content predictive formatting adapted to(a1) retrieve from the second computer resource as technical parameters data regarding at least a supported language, device type, device model, device manufacturer, operation system and version of the operation system of said second computer resource, User Agent and IP address to make the request from the second to the first computer resource for the media content with such end user parameters; and/or(a2) retrieve from the second computer resource as end-user information data regarding browser cookies, software usage, browsing history, geographical user location, IP address;(b) create a behavioral user profile based on the retrieved information; and(c) select dynamic content for the dynamic content plugin based upon the behavioral user profile.    [0010]    The present solution may further include a Traffic Distribution System, TDS which redirects clicks of a non-target user to the media content for which such a non-target user will be target audience, wherein the end user is determined to be non-target user if determined parameters of the end user do not satisfy conditions set forth for the media content.     [0011]    The present solution may further include tracking user activity relative to each media content entity loaded to the second computer resource, including validating end user actions and communicating said validation results to the database for further processing.     [0012]    The present solution may further comprise accessing a web site from the second computer resource further comprising;determining access parameters such as operation system of the second computer resource, connection parameters such as network type (WLan, LTE, 3G, EDGE, or the like), geographical location, a browser software, device make and model; and/or parsing collected content data fields to determine properties of the second computer resource, including various parameters of the device, the operation system type, manufacturer, version, the type of the device itself (i.e. phone, tablet, notebook etc.), the manufacturer of the device and device model; identifying a unique user ID of the end user, if such user has accessed DCP before if a user record with the end user ID already exists in the database, then the information is appended to the identified user record in the database, or creating a new user record in the database and appending the information to the user record, and providing the initial media content to the end user based upon information retrieved from the parsing.     [0013]    The present solution may further include accessing a web site from the second computer resource further comprising: appending the database user record each time there is any interaction of the end user with DCP with information related to said interaction, including at least one of a click, viewing of a media content proceeding to a link, downloading data or a computer program.     [0014]    The present solution may further include functionality, wherein an event of interaction, such as click is set to a valid or an invalid state, wherein, if the end user is not identified as a valid user, or a click is not identified as a valid click, the event will be recorded as invalid, and if the event is determined to be invalid, the TDS will be engaged.     [0015]    The present solution may further include functionality, wherein at the first computer resource, available information on prior interaction events of the end user are retrieved from the database and analyzed, and at each interaction event user preferences and statistical information related to the second computer resource and the end user are generated, and statistics in the database for the determined end user are created or updated.     [0016]    The present solution may further include functionality, wherein it is determined that media content entity that has been clicked and viewed the most by the end user, considering only valid clicks and actions, and wherein the most relevant content entity for the end user is identified, new content entity is offered to the end user based upon content characteristics including: Color scheme, Size, Language, Animation, Genre of content, Arrangement of the elements, Ratings, Images, Banner position, Banner format, and wherein determined user preferences are being used to optimize predictively format the content for a given end user in response to the determined end user preferences for said end user by a list of content entities available for the second computer resource based upon the determined user parameters and based upon the probability that the user will click at each of the selected content entities.     [0017]    The present solution may further include functionality, wherein the content entity with a highest weight is selected and sent to a Media Content Generator for generating content for the determined content entity including the following elements: a graphical icon for the application, rating of the application, name of the application, description, cost indication, application banners for display, etc, and wherein the elements are selected and content is generated and predictively formatted by the Media Content Generator in accordance with the determined user preferences.     [0018]    The present solution may further include functionality, wherein the generated and predictively formatted content is being sent to the DCP and displayed to the end user, and wherein each event of user interaction with the content provided by DCP is being detected, validated and recorded, and, if an event of interaction with the content is detected, the DCP sends a notification to the first computer resource.     [0019]    To summarize, the present solution provides important advantages to content providers, distributors and end users. The end users only receive the content they are likely to be interested in. The content is being generated for the user in the way that is most likely to be attractive to that specific user. The content distributors can optimize traffic and minimize the number of useless requests. The present solution allows content providers to maximize usage of their content and receive information on valid and invalid events of interaction with their content.      Brief description of the drawings     [0020]    Figure 1 depicts a block diagram of the system of the traffic distribution and click validation system in accordance with the present solution.     Detailed description     [0021]    The technical problem addressed by the present solution is to provide a method and a system for dynamic content generation and display, traffic distribution and optimization that addresses the shortcomings of the prior art approaches described above. Another technical problem addressed by the method of the present application is to predictively format the most relevant for end user content in order to promote user interaction with the displayed content.     [0022]    The present solution allows providers of the media content to offer the appropriate and most ""interesting"" content to the relevant target users in order to make sure that the user will actually interact with the provided content. It also provides the content providers and distributors with important statistics of how provided content has been used by the target users. The ultimate goal of any content provider is to provide the content to the target user auditory that will actually be utilized by the users, while at the same time limiting the number of empty traffic that does not lead to actual downloads and/or use of the provided content. The same can be said with respect to any content distributor that is providing references to such content at their web sites. Also, it is very important to the content provider, when content is provided to end users via distributors, to know what interaction events with their content entities have been performed by unique users of the target auditory, while disregarding the invalid interaction events that may be reported by the content distributors.     [0023]    Another goal of the content provider is to make sure that the level of interaction with the content shown to the relevant user is as high as possible. The goal would be to predict the way the content should be formatted for a particular user and format it in the way that would most likely prompt the user for interaction with the content.     [0024]    The system of the present solution, as shown on Figure 1 , provides a complete solution that includes a Dynamic Content Plugin, hereinafter DCP, that operates at the client device, analytical and statistical functionality implemented at the Server side 20, interaction with the tracking systems of the content source servers. The content is being generated individually for each requesting client in accordance with the client preferences, using predictive formatting for each end user. Therefore, the presentation of the content may differ for each user. In addition to dynamically generating content to be displayed to the user, the present solution includes Traffic Distribution System 17, hereinafter TDS, for redistribution of invalid clicks.     [0025]    The click will be considered as being invalid if determined user properties or user connection at the time of the click do not satisfy conditions specified by the content provider for the requested content. The examples of why a user and/or a click shall be considered invalid are set forth below.     [0026]    The TDS 17 redirects invalid clicks of the non-target user to the content for which such a non-target user will be target audience. Therefore, not only the unwanted traffic is eliminated, but the non-target user transforms to a target user and being provided with the content that is relevant to him. Moreover, the system and method of the present solution provide functionality of tracking user activity for each loaded content entity, including validating user actions and recording said validation results to the database 19 for further processing. This would allow content producers and distributers to receive statistical information for their content. As it has been noted above, this information not only is crucially important for optimization of content distribution, but it is important for the content producers to track only valid interaction events that are being reported by the content distributors. Moreover, this information is used for determining user preferences for predictive content formatting. All of the above mentioned advantages are described below in detail.     [0027]    The ""user"", as used herein, means any person accessing web site pages with installed DCP of solution the present solution via any personal devices that have access to the internet, such as, but not limited to mobile phones, tablet computers, notebook computers etc, herein the second computer resource, shown as devices 11, 12 and 13 on Figure 1 . In one embodiment the ""user"" is uniquely identified by the device that is being used to access the dynamic content in accordance with the present solution.     [0028]    The system 10 of the present solution, as shown on Figure 1 , comprises the following high-level elements:1. a Dynamic Content Plugin, operating at the user device, hereinafter a DCP,2. a Server 20 or first computer resource, the following software modules:a. Optimization Engine 14,b. Parsing module 15,c. Analytical module 16,d. Traffic Distribution System module 17,e. Content Media Generator 183. a Database 194. a Tracking system at the content source server    [0029]    The Database 19 stores information on the content items, data collected by DCP at the user device 11 - 13 or second computer resource (including various behavioral user information), content information and attributes, as well as results of statistical and analytical research, produced by the Analytical module 16 for each known user and content entity. The database 19 may store data in relational and non-relational format.     [0030]    DCP is a web plugin that may be included into any web page and be accessed from any device that is connected to the internet. In accordance with the present invention, DCP may be included into a web-site page and loaded to a client device 11 when said website page is requested by the user. The DCP has two main functions to it. It collects the data of the user device and displays the dynamic content data that is being generated by the system of the present solution in accordance to the user preferences, as described in detail below.     [0031]    Every time when DCP is loaded to a user device 11 - 13, it reads and processes all available cookies of the device. It also looks for cookies that may have been set by DCP before, if previously it has been loaded to this device. If cookies were found, DCP sends their values to the server. If no cookies previously set by DCP were found, then this device has not been used with DCP before, so DCP assigns the user a new unique ID, sets corresponding cookies so a new user is created in the database. If the cookie with the unique user ID is present, DCP will send this user ID to the server, so that the user can be identified by the system. DCP may also update existing cookies with up to date information. If there is available information on the content that has been used by the user outside DCP, this information is also collected. Third party providers may be used to collect additional information on the user, such as gender age etc.     [0032]    Accordingly, DCP collects various information from the client device 11 - 13, including, but not limited to IP address, User Agent, Accept Language and cookies from HTTP header fields of the client device and sends said collected parameters to the Server, as will be described in detail below.     [0033]    The collected information on the user is provided by DCP to the server side services, in particular the database record for the user is being created or updated and all new and historical user information is being passed to the Analytical module 16 to determine user preferences, as described in detail below.     [0034]    For each user that is ever accessed any content via DCP there is a record in the database. The Database 19 includes information on every event of interaction of the user with the content. Based upon previously accessed content, user preferences are determined in real time, so each user record is provided with possible content types and qualities of the content that may be of interest to the user and will provoke interaction with the content, as it will described in detail below.     [0035]    The Database 19 stores information for each content entity, being distributed via the system of the present invention. For each content entity, the content provider may specify specific rules that define target auditory by specifying specific combination of qualities and parameters of the target user for that specific content entity. The rules defined by the content provider are stored in the database in a form of list of properties and dependencies of the target user for the specific content item. For example for a user to be identified as a valid user for the content item, parameters such as country, internet connection type, device type, device model, operating system name, gender, age, content preferences and prior activity etc must match the corresponding parameters specified for the selected content entity.     [0036]    The initial user information is being received from the request string when the user is requesting the web page with DCP incorporated therein.     For example:    [0037]    A user has accessed a web site from a portable device, using Android OS, uses 3G connection and located in China. Geographical location will be determined by IP address (this can be done using known in the industry methods). User Agent string is used to determine the browser (for example Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.3; Nexus 7 Build/JWR66Y) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.72 Safari/537.36), device make and model, operation system of the device, and well as type of connection with internet.     [0038]    The Parsing Module 15 is used to parse collected HTTP header fields to determine properties of the client device. Such properties may include various parameters of the device, the operation system type, manufacturer, version, the type of the device itself (i.e. phone, tablet, notebook etc.), the manufacturer of the device and device model.     [0039]    The initial request string may also include a unique user ID, if such user has accessed DCP before. If the user already exists in the database, then the information is appended to the identified record in the database. Otherwise, the initial content is provided to the user based upon information retrieved from the request string by the parsing module. So a content entity having targeting on China, Android version 4.3, Nexus 7 would be selected. However, if the user has been matched with the existing user in the database, the content will be generated and presented to the user in accordance with the available user preferences that have been previously recorded for that user.     [0040]    Certain known in the industry commercially available databases may be used for the purposes of storing content and user data. As a non-limiting example ""Mongo"" may be used to track events of interaction with the content and ""Redis""can be used for user information. At least the following information can be stored for each event of interaction with the content:Table 1 Gco""RU""Country of the locationGrg""Bashkortostan""Region of the countryGci""Ufa""CityGct""3G""Type of connectionOs""iOS""Operating system nameOsv""8.1""Operating system versionMdl""iPad""Device modelMnf""Apple""Device manufacturerTyp""tablet""Device typeapp_idNumberLong(63071)Internal product IDAidNumberLong(1003630)Internal content IDCplNumberLong(O)Event typedcISODate(""2016-01-21T07:42:46.557Z"")Date of eventdiISODate(""2016-01-21T07:44:46.557Z"")Date of interactionpidNumberLong(1002657)Web site unique IDb""Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 8_1_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/600.1.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) CriOS/47.0.2526.107 Mobile/12B440 Safari/600.1.4""User Agent Stringips""145.255.2.176""IP Addressuuid""87387174""Unique user IDis_uniqueNumberLong(1)Flag of uniqueness of the click (if a click is not unique, TDS will activate)validTrueValidness of the click (if click is not valid, TDS will activate)ua_language""RU""Browser language    [0041]    At least the following information is being stored by in the database for each identified unique user:Table 2 IdType""udid""Type of unique ID of a device or browser (udid acquired from cookies, idfa for iOS, gaid for Android)IdValue""33775490""Value of the IdTypeDataType""fingerprint""Type of data acquisition ""Fingerprint"" if only IP address and User Agent available, cookies if set, udi, idfa or gaid if availableOSName""Android 4.3""OS name and versionDeviceModel""Nexus 7""Device modelDeviceMake""Google""Device manufacturerInteractedProduct127.0.0.1:6379[2]> smembers uu: user: 1498100:leadID of a product user interacted and IP address the user interacted with a product fromContentID_IP127.0.0.1:6379[2]> zrange uu:user:6374735:clicks 0 - 1Content Id user clicked from a IP addressProductID_IP127.0.0.1:6379[2]> smembers uu:leads:app:47179351Product Id user clicked from a IP address    [0042]    Every time there is any interaction of the user with DCP, the database record is being appended with the relevant information as set forth above. Every user action, such as click, viewing, proceeding to a link, downloading etc. is being recorded and validated. In particular, every event of interaction, such as click can be set to valid or invalid state. For example, if the user is not identified as a valid user, or a click is not identified as a valid click, the event will be recorded as invalid. If the event is determined to be invalid, the TDS will be engaged, as described in detail below.     [0043]    The Analytical module 16 is software module located at the server site. It retrieves all available information on the prior user interactions from the database and analyzes said information. At each event, the Analytical module 16 may generate updated client preferences and statistical information for the client device and creates or updates statistics in the database for the determined unique user. It is noted that the user preferences are only calculated based upon valid events of user interaction with DCP. Invalid events are disregarded for these purposes.     [0044]    The Analytical module 16 processes records as described in Table 1 and Table 2 to determine content that has been clicked and viewed the most by a user, considering only valid clicks and actions. When the most relevant or ""interesting"" content for the user is identified, new content can be offered to the user based upon one or more of the following content characteristics: Color scheme Size Language Animation Genre of content (games, business applications etc) Arrangement of the elements (games ""tree in a row"") Ratings Pictures (cats, dogs, weapons etc) Banner position Banner format E.t.c    [0045]    For example, the Analytical module 16 may determine that the user likely clicks at the yellow color content of medium size, in English language and interested in in ""tree in a row"" games, or on the banner that has cats.     [0046]    The determined user preferences are being passed to the Optimization engine 14. The Optimization Engine 14 is a software module located at the server site 20. The Optimization Engine 14 is used to optimize the content for a given user in response to the user preferences determined by the Analytical module 16 for said user. The Optimization Engine 14 receives a request for the available content for the user. In response to the request, Optimization engine 14 queries the database 19 to determine a list of content entities available for the client device based upon the determined user parameters, such as location and device information and preferences. The Optimization engine 14 determines the probability that the user will click at each of the selected content entities. The probability is determined based upon comparisons of the properties of the selected content entities with statistical information of the user's previous interactions with DCP. Each content entity assigned a relative weight.     [0047]    The content entity with the highest weight is selected and sent to the Media Content Generator 18. In particular, the content entity may comprise a mobile software application, a game or link to a web site. The Content Media Generator 18 generates content for the determined content entity. The content includes the following elements: a graphical icon for the application (App Icon), rating of the application (App Rating), name of the application (App Name), description (App Description), cost indication (Free App), application banners for display (Banner Set), etc. The elements are selected and content is generated by the Media Content Generator 18 in accordance with the determined user preferences. The Media Content Generator 18 provides predictive formatting of the generated content in accordance with user preferences and statistics. Accordingly, for each user the same content entity may be presented in a different way, such that the user most likely would proceed with interacting with this content. This unique advantage of the present solution allows content providers to make sure that their content will get the highest utilization possible with relevant target auditory.     [0048]    While in most cases (about 95%) the highest weight content will be used, in certain cases (about 5%) content entities that have no statistics associated to them may be provided to a user in order to get statistical information on those content items. Weight is assigned to the content items by the optimization engine based upon the performed prioritization of the content items for the specific user.     [0049]    Once the content is generated it is being sent to the DCP and displayed to the user. Each event of user interaction with the content provided by DCP is being registered, validated and recorded. The following event types are being processed by the system: Viewing Clicks Download    [0050]    Additionally, third party events, such as reviewing tutorial, passing a level in the downloaded game, using the downloaded software can be received from a third party provider and also processed by the system.     [0051]    Once an event of interaction with the content is detected, the DCP sends a notification to the server 20. For example, upon the user has viewed the content, the information about the viewing of the content by the user is saved to the database 19 in the format including at least the fields specified in Table 1 and Table 2 for further analysis by the Analytical module 16.     [0052]    If the user clicks at an icon or a link of the generated content within DCP, the DCP notifies the server 20 of event of redirect and forwards the user to the provider of the requested digital content (or application). For example, the request for content can look like the following:""http://impressions.clickky.biz/ads-api v3?key=984f4836bf45f83367f03dd4b507f5d8&format=json&cp.ict=WIFI&cp.d type=Smartphone&devicetype=1&cp.resolution=720x1280&tz=0.0&client0s=Android&osv=17&cp.model=HTCEvo - 4.2.2 - API 17 - 720x1280&model=HTC Evo - 4.2.2 - API 17 - 720x1280&cp.make=Genymotion&make=Genymotion&cp.carrier=Android&clientIp=10.0.3.15&clientUa=Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.2.2; en-us; HTC Evo - 4.2.2 -API 17 - 720x1280 Build/JDQ39E) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0Mobile Safari/534.30""    [0053]    The request string will be parsed by the Parsing Module 15. The parsed information on the redirect will be saved to the database 19 in the format according to Table 1 for further analysis by the Analytical module 16. The user information is updated in accordance with Table 2. Every event of interaction is being registered by DCP and recorded to the database 19, and the user identification and validity check is also done at every event. The dynamic nature of the internet makes it important to keep checking the validity of user actions and uniqueness of the user at all times. This allows to keep database current and to gather the most accurate information for the content providers, since content providers only interested in valid events or actions performed by the unique users.     [0054]    In case redirected user installs the application at his device, the source server of the application, such as iTunes Store, Google Play Store etc., provides information via third party tracking system. The information on download, installation, registration process and the like is being sent to the server, converted to the format corresponding to Table 1 and Table 2 and saved to the database 19. The saved information includes IFA for iOS applications, Google AID for Android applications etc.     [0055]    In the case a user or click is deemed invalid at the time when content is already shown to the user, i.e. loaded to the user device, the Traffic Distribution System module 17 provides further important advantages to the digital content distributers and manufacturers. It provides traffic optimization and effectiveness increase.     [0056]    While the system of the present invention attempts to validate the user at the early stage of interaction, it is not always possible. In certain cases the initial request for content does not return proper information to identify the user. For example, there may be parsing errors for the initial request data, or the data may be lost or corrupt.     [0057]    Another example of detecting invalid user or click may relate to situations when certain content should be available to users having certain connection type. As it has been described above, the present system attempts to detect connection type (LTE, 3G, Wifi, etc) at the time of HTTP request, at the time the content is loaded to the user device, and at the time of the click. However, this information may not be available or correctly detected in all cases. The connection type is determined based upon IP address of the user, the IP address is being passed to a third party service and the connection type is being received in return. However, these third party services may not respond fast enough to make sure that the content targeted to users with certain connection type is shown only to such users. In some cases the connection type may not be properly detected prior to the content is loaded to user's device. However, the information on connection type may become available only at the time of click. In this case it would be determined that the user does not have the needed connection type after the content entity is already loaded to the device and the user has already clicked on it. In this case the click will be deemed to be invalid. Content may be designated to users having certain connection types because of technical limitations (for example heavier content may be limited to wifi traffic), or provider limitations.     [0058]    The same is true with respect to the other user properties. If the content is already loaded or about to be loaded to the user device, if the DCP detects user parameters that are different from what was determined from parsing the initial request string and these detected parameters do not satisfy requirements set forth for the loaded content entity, the user and/or click will be invalidated by the system.     [0059]    In some cases, content may be cached in memory on the user device and not refreshed automatically, so that at the time of the click the content entity would not be active. In some cases, it is possible that user parameters received with the initial request do not match with the parameters received at a later stage, when the DCA is already loaded. For example, the initial request may specify USA as a country of the requesting user, however, at subsequent check, the country may actually be determined as Canada. The requested content may be available for USA, but unavailable for Canada. However, the content may already be displayed to the user. In such cases any click on the content within DCP will be recorded as invalid. It is also possible that the user that have been initially identified as unique, is being determined at the time of the click as not unique, yet the content is already shown to such user. Furthermore, even if the user is unique, the action performed by the user may be invalid for shown content based upon further determined user properties. In such cases it is crucially important to handle each such invalid case and still show relevant content to the unique users.     [0060]    In such cases, TDS 17 will use the Analytical module 16s to determine the most relevant content entity for the user, as described in detail above. The optimization engine 14 may provide the user with a link to an appropriate content page or the content media generator 18 will generate the content for the user in accordance with preferences, and will provide the user with relevant content instead of invalid. The new landing page prepared for the user will be generated in accordance with user preferences. For example, if the user prefers blue colored graphics and pictures of cats in the banners it will be generated to have such elements on the page.     [0061]    To summarize, the present solution provides important advantages to content providers, distributors and end users. The end users only receive the content they are likely to be interested in. The content is being generated for the user in the way that is most likely to be attractive to that specific user. The content distributors can optimize traffic and minimize the number of useless requests. The present solution allows content providers to maximize usage of their content and receive information on valid and invalid events of interaction with their content. The technical problem of reducing and optimizing traffic is addressed by providing a method and a system for dynamic content generation and display, traffic distribution and optimization. The present method is advantageous, since it is limiting the traffic by providing only relevant content to the right users. Moreover, predictive formatting provides even further advantages in traffic optimization, since if the end user is more likely to interact with the loaded content, said user would less likely look for other similar content, thereby creating more traffic between the end user and content distributors.

SUMMARY    [0004]    An exemplary atomizing head includes a main body, an air inlet, an exit pipe, two connecting electrode, a liquid conducting element, and a heating element. The main body defines an atomizing chamber and a through hole. The through hole communicates with the atomizing chamber such that tobacco liquid can flow into the atomizing chamber. The liquid conducting element is configured for absorbing tobacco liquid. The liquid conducting element defines at least one air passage. The heating element is in contact with the liquid conducting element. The heating element is configured for heating the tobacco liquid to forum aerosol. The aerosol is expelled via the at least one air passage. Two opposite ends of the heating element are connected to the two connecting electrodes.

[0010]    Referring to FIGS.1-3 , an atomizing head 100 is shown. The atomizing head 100 is detachably arranged in an atomizer 200 (as seen in FIG. 7 ). The atomizing head 100 includes a main body 120, an air inlet 131, an exit pipe 110, a first connecting electrode 130 and a second connecting electrode 124. The main body 120 defines an atomizing chamber 123. The main body 120 further defines a through hole 121 so that tobacco liquid can flow into the atomizing chamber 123 via the through hole 121. A liquid conducting element 170 and a heating element 173 are arranged in the atomizing chamber 123. The liquid conducting element 170 is configured (i.e., structured and arranged) for absorbing tobacco liquid. The heating element 173 is in contact with the liquid conducting element 170. The liquid conducting element 170 defines a plurality of air passages 172 communicating the air inlet 131 and the exit pipe 110. The heating element 173 is configured for heating the tobacco liquid to form aerosol. The aerosol passes through the air passage 172, and then flows out from the exit pipe 110.     [0011]    In the present embodiment, the exit pipe 110 includes an air outlet 111, the air inlet 131 is defined in the first connecting electrode 130, and the second connecting electrode 124 and the main body 120 are integrally formed. The main body 120 includes a plurality of external screws 122, via which the atomizing head 100 is detachably engaged in the atomizer. The atomizing head 100 is further provided with a sealing ring 150 nesting the exit pipe 110.     [0012]    Referring to FIGS. 3-5 , the liquid conducting element 170 is cylindrical, and defines a plurality of air passages 172. The liquid conducting element 170 divides the atomizing chamber 123 into two areas. One area is configured for storing tobacco liquid, while the other includes a plurality of air passages 172. A first sealing element 180 and a second sealing element 190 are arranged at two opposite ends of the liquid conducting element 170, and configured for separating the two areas. The liquid conducting element 170 is made of ceramic material. The heating element 173 is arranged in the liquid conducting element 170. Two opposite ends 174, 175 of the heating element 173 are electrically connected to the first connecting electrode 130 and the second connecting electrode 124. The heating element 173 is formed in the liquid conducting element 170 by e.g., sintering. The liquid conducting element 170 absorbs tobacco liquid flowed into the atomizing chamber 123 via the through hole 121. The liquid conducting element 170 can prevent the tobacco liquid from flowing out from the air inlet 131 and air outlet 111.     [0013]    Referring to FIG. 5 , a temperature sensor 171 is arranged on a liquid conducting element 170, and configured for sensing a temperature of the liquid conducting element 170. In the present embodiment, the first sealing element 180 and the second sealing element 190 may be made of rubber or silicone.     [0014]    In the present embodiment, the liquid conducting element 170 defines a plurality of air passages 172, the air from the air inlet 131 flows through the air passage 172, and then flows out from the exit pipe 110. The tobacco liquid flowed into the atomizing chamber is only stored in one of the two areas, and will not flow out through the air passage 172. Therefore, the liquid conducting element 170 can prevent liquid leakage.     [0015]    In other embodiments, a total number of the air passages may be one or two. In an alternative embodiment, an exterior surface of the liquid conducting element 170 is in contact with an interior surface of the atomizing chamber 123.     [0016]    Referring to FIG. 6-7 , an atomizer 200 is shown. The atomizer 200 is configured for coupling with a power supply 300 to form an electronic cigarette (as seen in FIG. 8 ). The atomizer 200 includes a housing 220, a liquid chamber 240, an air pipe 230, the atomizing head 100, and a fixing holder 170. The liquid chamber 240 is adapted for storing tobacco liquid. The tobacco liquid in the liquid chamber 240 flows into the atomizing chamber 123 via the through hole 121 (also referring to FIG. 3 ). The exit pipe 110 is hermetically connected with the air pipe 230 via the sealing ring 150. The main body 120 is detachably connected with the fixing holder 270 through the external screws 122.     [0017]    Referring to FIG. 7 , the atomizer 200 further includes a first electrode 250 and a second electrode 260. After the atomizing head 100 is assembled with the fixing holder 170, the first electrode 250 and the second electrode 260 are electrically connected to the first connecting electrode 130 and the second connecting electrode 124, respectively.     [0018]    Referring to FIG. 8 , an electronic cigarette is shown. The electronic cigarette includes the above atomizer 200 of the second embodiment and a power supply 300. The atomizer 200 and the power supply 300 are coupled via screw threads. The power supply 300 is configured for supplying the atomizer 200 power.

Cheng     Thomas D. Lovett     Michael A. Parker     FIELD     The present disclosure relates to enhancements for network systems, and more particularly, to traffic class arbitration based on priority and bandwidth allocation.     BACKGROUND     High Performance Computing (HPC) applications often employ HPC fabric network communication technologies such as, for example, Infiniband. These HPC fabrics may carry different types of traffic including management traffic, storage traffic, application traffic, etc. There may also be different classes of application traffic associated with different levels of Quality of Service (QoS) and different priorities and latency requirements. Existing network fabric switches are generally able to only approximate user configuration requests for priority, share of bandwidth and latency of a user's network traffic.     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS     Features and advantages of the claimed subject matter will be apparent from the following detailed description of embodiments consistent therewith, which description should be considered with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:     FIG. 1 illustrates a top level diagram of a network system consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure;     FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of a network node consistent with various     embodiments of the present disclosure;     FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of a network controller consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure; FIG. 4 illustrates a packet frame consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure;     FIG. 5 illustrates a virtual lane group table consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure; and     FIG. 6 illustrates a flowchart of operations of one example embodiment consistent with the present disclosure.     Although the following Detailed Description will proceed with reference being made to illustrative embodiments, many alternatives, modifications, and variations thereof will be apparent to those skilled in the art.     DETAILED DESCRIPTION     Generally, this disclosure provides systems, devices, methods and computer readable media for enhanced network communication for use in higher performance applications including storage, high performance computing (HPC) and Ethernet-based fabric interconnects. A network controller may be configured as part of a network node, for example a switch, to provide arbitration and preemption of packets between multiple traffic classes that may be associated with virtual lanes, as will be described in greater detail below. Arbitration may be performed by adjusting priorities based on a comparison of measured bandwidth (BW) consumption to BW allocation for the virtual lanes.     Preemption may be performed based on relative priorities and latency sensitivity of packets transmitted over the virtual lanes. Thus, rules may be provided to configure multiple levels of priority and to specify the amount of bandwidth that may be consumed by higher priority traffic such that lower priority traffic is not starved of bandwidth. Higher-priority traffic, which may generally be of lower bandwidth, may therefore be given priority over other traffic without concern that it could deprive the other traffic of bandwidth if the higher priority traffic were to exceed its allocated bandwidth limits.     FIG. 1 illustrates a network system 100 consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure. Network system 100 generally includes at least one network node element 102 (also referred to herein as ""source node 102"" or a ""sender node""), at least one intermediate node element 122 (also referred to herein as a ""switch node"") and an end node element 126 (also referred to herein as a ""receiving node""), each configured to communicate with one another via communications links 124a and 124b, as shown. The source node 102, intermediate node 122 and the end node 126 may be included as link partners in a network fabric, for example an HPC fabric. It is to be understood that the illustration of FIG. 1 is provided for ease of description and that the network fabric may include a plurality of intermediate node elements and/or end node elements, each connected in series and/or parallel with each other and or/with the source node 102, to form for example, a torus network topology, ring topology, Clos topology, fat tree topology, etc. The source node 102, intermediate node 122 and/or end node 126 may each comprise a computer node element (e.g., host server system, laptop, tablet, workstation, etc.), switch, router, bridge, hub, fabric interconnect, network storage device, network attached device, non-volatile memory (NVM) storage device, etc.     It will be appreciated that the terms ""source node"" and ""end node"" are used to simplify the description and are not meant to imply a unidirectional transmission flow. Although one side of a full duplex connection may often be referred to herein, the operations are also applicable to the reverse direction (e.g., from end node 126 to source node 102).     A user or network administrator 140 (or other suitable entity) may define any number of traffic classes (TCs) for the network fabric 100, over which different types of traffic may be transmitted, for example in the form of packets. A traffic class may be defined as a quality of service (QoS) level that may be defined apriori between the node elements. More generally, a traffic class may represent a categorization of computer network traffic. For example, certain applications (e.g., voice/video) may require a certain level of packet throughput to operate properly, while other applications like general web browsing and email may not require the throughput of voice and/or video applications. Thus, the traffic classes may be established so that, for example, packet transfers in one traffic class may take priority over transfers from another class. Also, certain traffic, e.g., storage traffic, may be assigned a separate traffic class that may require no packet loss characteristics while other traffic classes may be serviced in a best effort manner. Flow control or congestion management may be enabled in certain traffic classes that require no packet loss behavior, etc.     In some embodiments, the links 124a, 124b may be configured to include any number of virtual lanes (VLs) or groups of virtual lanes (VLGs), which may be associated with different traffic classes (TCs). For example, virtual lane 1 may be configured to carry TCs 1-3 and virtual lane 2 may be configured to carry TCs 4 and 5. In some embodiments, however, a limitation may be imposed such that a VL is associated with only one TC.     Additionally, in some embodiments, multiple VLs may be associated with a TC. So, for example, VLs 0-1 may be associated with TCs 0-4 and VLs 2-3 may be associated with TCs 5- 16.     The user/admin 140 may also provide a specification to define the relative priorities between TCs as well as an allocated share of link bandwidth to be provided for each TC. A fabric manager 150 may be configured to map these specifications to the device level (e.g., nodes 102, 122, 126) for use by arbitration and preemption logic, as will be described below. Thus, each VL or VLG may have a defined priority and an allocated share of network or link bandwidth.     The source node 102, the intermediate node 122 and the end node 126 may communicate with each other, via links 124a and 124b, using, for example, an Ethernet communications protocol. The Ethernet communications protocol may be capable of providing communication using a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). The Ethernet protocol may comply or be compatible with the Ethernet standard published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) titled ""IEEE 802.3 Standard,"" published in March, 2002 and/or later versions of this standard, for example, the IEEE 802.3 Standard for Ethernet, published 2012. The Ethernet protocol may also comply or be compatible with the IEEE standard for Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges and Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks titled ""IEEE 802.1Q Standard,"" published, 2005 or later versions of this standard, for example, the IEEE 802.1Q Standard published, 2011. Of course, in other embodiments, the source node 102, the intermediate node 122 and the end node 126 may communicate with each other using, for example, proprietary and/or custom communication protocols that may or may not resemble the aforementioned Ethernet communications protocol.     FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of a network node 200 consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure. The node 200, which may be representative of node 102, 122, and/or 126 of FIG. 1, may include a network controller 204 (e.g., network interface card, etc.), a system processor 206 (e.g., multi-core general purpose processor, such as those provided by Intel Corp., etc.) and system memory 208. The system memory 208 may include one or more buffers 238, each of which may be established and/or controlled, at least in part, by the network controller 204 and or system processor 206.     The network controller 204 includes PHY circuitry 210 generally configured to interface the nodes via communications links 124a, 124b. PHY circuitry 210 may comply or be compatible with, the aforementioned IEEE 802.3 Ethernet communications protocol, which may include, for example, 10GBASE- T, 10GBASE-KR, 40GBASE-KR4, 40GBASE-CR4, lOOGBASE-CRlO, 100GBASE-CR4, 100GBASE-KR4, and/or 100GBASE-KP4 and/or other PHY circuitry that is compliant with the aforementioned IEEE 802.3 Ethernet communications protocol and/or compliant with any after-developed communications protocol. PHY circuitry 210 includes a transmitter circuit (Tx) 212 configured to transmit data packets and/or frames via linksl24a, 124b, and a receiver circuit (Rx) 214 configured to receive data packets and/or frames from via links 124a, 124b. Of course, PHY circuitry 210 may also include encoding/decoding circuitry (not shown) configured to perform analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion, encoding and decoding of data, analog parasitic cancellation (for example, cross talk     cancellation), and recovery of received data. Rx circuit 214 may include phase lock loop circuitry (PLL, not shown) configured to coordinate timing of data reception.     The communications link 124a and/or 124b may each comprise, for example, a media dependent interface that may include, for example, copper twin-axial cable, backplane traces on a printed circuit board, fibre optic cable, copper twisted pair cable, etc. In some embodiments, the communications links 124a and 124b each may include a plurality of logical and/or physical channels (e.g., differential pair channels) that provide separate connections between, for example, the Tx and Rx 212/214 of the nodes 102, 122, 126. In the case of the intermediate node 122, (for example, a switch or a router) there may not be an explicit network controller 204 within the intermediate node, however the functional blocks illustrated for the network controller 204 may be included as part of the switch or router logic or silicon. ""Link Level,"" as used herein, means frame communication between, for example, source node 102 and intermediate node 122 through a link 124a. Thus, in this context, the ""link"" includes frame transmission between node 102 and node 122 over link 124a. For example, TX circuit of node 102 sends frames to RX circuit of node 122 over link 124a.     Network controller 204 also includes a media access control (MAC) module 220 configured to provide addressing and access control protocols for communication with the intermediate node 122 and/or the end node 126, as may be defined by the aforementioned Ethernet communications protocol (e.g., MAC module 220 may be a Layer 2 device).     The network controller 204 may also include a bandwidth monitor module 218 generally configured to measure bandwidth consumed by each of the virtual lanes 230 on links 124a, 124b. The network controller 204 may also include a priority arbiter module 216 generally configured to adjust the priority of a virtual lane based on a comparison of the measured bandwidth to an allocated share of bandwidth for that lane. The network controller 104 may also include preemption and interleaving module 228 generally configured to interrupt transmission of lower priority packets for higher priority packets. Each of the modules 216, 218 and 228 will be described in greater detail below. It should be understood that, in some embodiments, a node may include a subset of the modules illustrated in FIG. 2 and therefore, not all of the illustrated modules are necessary for any embodiment. In some embodiments, the various components, circuits and modules of the network node 102, 122, 126 (including the network controller 204, processor 206 and/or other systems may be combined in a system-on-a-chip (SoC) architecture. The SoC may be included as part of a server system or CPU.     FIG. 3 illustrates a more detailed block diagram 300 of portions of network controller 204 consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure. A number (K) of virtual lanes 230 (i.e., VL 0 through VL K-l) are provided as input to the network controller 204. Each virtual lane may be associated with a traffic class. Bandwidth monitor module 218 is shown to include a number (N) of bandwidth meters 320, each configured to measure the bandwidth consumed by a selected group of virtual lanes. In some embodiments, up to N groups of virtual lanes may be selected for measurement by VL group select module 302. The groups of virtual lanes (VLGs) may include any of the K virtual lanes that are provided as input. For example a first VLG may include VL 0, VL 2 and VL 3, while a second VLG may include VL 1, VL 5 and VL K-l . Of course, any other groupings and combinations are possible with up to N different groups and up to K different VLs. Thus each of the VLs may be assigned to one of the N     bandwidth meters 320 and, in some embodiments, multiple VLs may be assigned to a bandwidth meter. In general, though, a VL may not be assigned to multiple bandwidth meters 302. In some embodiments, the bandwidth meters 302 may be implemented using Token Buckets, Leaky Buckets, Sliding Windows or any other known mechanism configured to measure the bandwidth usage consumed within a period of time. Priority arbiter module 216 is shown, in this example, to include 4 arbiter sub-modules 216a, 216b, 216c, 216d each configured to arbitrate among one of the 4 priority levels: High- Priority, Medium-Priority, Low-Priority and Over-Bandwidth, respectively. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments any number of arbiter sub-modules and associated priority levels may be used. Priority arbiter module 216 is also shown to include a priority group selection module 304 configured to regulate the way in which link bandwidth is shared by the multiple VLs or VLGs based on the bandwidth monitoring, particularly when one or more VLs or VLGs exceed their allocated bandwidth limits. A VL or VLG that exceeds its allocated bandwidth is termed ""non-conforming"" in this disclosure, otherwise it is considered to be ""conforming."" For example, if VL-0 is allocated X bits per second, but the network tries to transmit traffic through at a packet rate that exceeds X bits per second, then VL-0 will be classified as non-conforming. The classification of a VL/VLG as either conforming or nonconforming may change over time based on the results of the bandwidth monitoring.     When traffic is conforming, the bandwidth monitoring may play no role. The arbitration policy for conforming traffic may include the application of pre-assigned priority, for example by module 304, across the priority levels of a given group (VLG) (e.g., High-Priority, Medium- Priority, and Low-Priority). Within a priority level, a round-robin scheme may be employed by each priority arbiter sub-module 216a, 216b, 216c, for choosing a VL assigned to that priority. In some embodiments, any of a number of other known alternatives to the round-robin scheme may be used, such as, for example a least-recently-used scheme. Groups that exceed the bandwidth allocation, however, may be assigned, for example by module 304, to a lowest possible priority level. This lowest level (e.g., Over-BW priority level) is lower than the priority levels assigned to any of the conforming traffic (e.g., 216a, 216b, 216c).     In operation, each VL may be assigned to one of theN bandwidth monitoring groups associated with one of theN bandwidth meters 320. In a first example embodiment, a bandwidth check is performed on each VL by the bandwidth meter to which the VL is assigned. The check is to determine if the VL has exceeded the allocated bandwidth usage. If the usage has not been exceeded (i.e., the VL passes the BW check), then the VL is provided, as a candidate for arbitration, to the priority arbiter sub-module associated with the assigned priority level for that VL (e.g., High-Priority, Medium-Priority, and Low-Priority). If the usage has been exceeded (i.e., the VL fails the BW check), then the VL is assigned to the lowest priority level, e.g., Over- Bandwidth level, and is provided, as a candidate for arbitration, to the Over-BW priority arbiter sub-module 216d. Each of the arbiter sub-modules 216a, 216b, 216c, and 216d perform arbitration among all of their candidates at the priority level associated with that sub-module (e.g., High-Priority, Medium-Priority, Low-Priority and Over-Bandwidth).     In a second example embodiment, each VL is assigned to one of the N bandwidth monitoring groups associated with one of the N bandwidth meters 320, but each bandwidth monitoring group arbitrates among its assigned VLs to produce one candidate VL for that group. The resulting candidate VL for the group is bandwidth checked to determine if the VL has exceeded the allocated bandwidth usage. If the usage has not been exceeded, then the VL is provided, as a candidate for arbitration, to the priority arbiter sub-module associated with the assigned priority level for that VL (e.g., High-Priority, Medium-Priority, and Low-Priority). If the usage has been exceeded, then the VL is assigned to the lowest priority level, e.g., Over- Bandwidth level, and is provided, as a candidate for arbitration, to the Over-BW priority arbiter sub-module 216d.     The following illustration may serve to highlight the differences between the first and second embodiment examples described above. For the purposes of this illustration there are six VLs (VLs 0-5) and two bandwidth monitoring groups (BWO and BWl). VLs 0-3 are assigned to BWO and VLs 4-5 are assigned to BWl. Further, to this illustration, all of the VLs are allocated 10% of the available bandwidth and all are exceeding that limit. Thus, in the first example embodiment, all VLs 0-5 will fail their BW checks and proceed to the Over-BW priority arbitration 216d where they will each receive an equal share (1/6) of the available bandwidth. In the second example embodiment, however, BWO monitoring group will pick a first candidate from among VLs 0-3 and BWl monitoring group will pick a second candidate from among VLs 4-5. Both candidates will fail their BW checks and proceed to the Over-BW priority arbitration 216d where they will be selected at equal rates (1/2 each) with the result that each of VLs 0-3 receive 1/8 of the available bandwidth (four VLs share half of the bandwidth), while each of VLs 4-5 receive 1/4 of the available bandwidth (two VLs share the other half of the bandwidth).     In some embodiments, if a VL fails the bandwidth check it may be disqualified from transmission (e.g., not made available as a candidate for any arbitration), thus allowing the Over- BW priority arbiter sub-module 216d to be eliminated. The arbitration performed by each arbiter sub module 216a, 216b, 216c, 216d may be independent of the arbitrations performed by the other sub modules. For example, the Low- Priority arbiter sub-module 216c can make a selection without checking whether there is a High- Priority candidate that would render that selection irrelevant. This independent arbitration process may use any of a number of known arbitration schemes, including round-robin or least- recently-used, which may be chosen by the implementation. The selected VL resulting from the arbitration (e.g., the VL that ""wins"" arbitration) in each of the priority levels may then go through an additional stage of arbitration based on their priority levels. In this additional stage, the highest priority candidate takes precedence over the lower priority candidates and is selected 308 for transmission.     Preemption and interleaving module 228 may be configured to perform packet preemption and interleaving during another stage of the arbitration process. Packet preemption may be employed to reduce latency for high-priority latency sensitive traffic. Certain types of data and applications may be more sensitive to packet latency than others. For example, an audio stream in a voice-over- IP application may be more sensitive to latency because users engaged in a two-way conversation will typically be distracted or annoyed by latency in the audio transmission. In some embodiments, latency sensitivity may be quantified and associated with a type of traffic. The sensitivity may be expressed, for example in terms of an acceptable time delay or as a relative measure of importance.     Interleaving may be employed to reduce bandwidth wastage on the link when     fragmentation occurs in the currently active packet. Fragmentation may occur, for example, when preemption is applied by preemption and interleaving modules of upstream nodes (e.g., other intermediate nodes 122 between the current node and the source node 102). Users or network administrators may specify that certain VLs or VLGs carry latency sensitive traffic. The preemption and interleaving module 228 may be configured to allow packets in these VLGs to preempt packets in other VLGs by interrupting transmission of a lower priority packet to send the higher priority packet. When the higher priority packet has been transmitted, transmission of the preempted packet is resumed. In some embodiments, a packet of any priority may be allowed to interleave into another active packet if that active packet runs out of (e.g., is depleted of) flow control digits (FLITS) to send, where a FLIT is the smallest unit of transmittable information that is subject to flow control. Thus, rules may be set to configure multiple levels of priority and to specify the amount of bandwidth that may be consumed by higher priority traffic to control bandwidth starvation of lower priority traffic. A rule may specify, for example, that a traffic class which requires relatively low latency along with relatively low bandwidth is configured at the highest priority but with a small bandwidth guarantee, for example 10% of available bandwidth is guaranteed to the class. As long as the nodes generating this traffic conform to this low bandwidth expectation, the traffic class will continue to receive the highest priority. If one or more nodes start sending an abnormal amount of this traffic, either due to programming error or with malicious intent, the traffic class will exceed its bandwidth guarantee and its priority will drop. Higher priority traffic, which is specified as lower bandwidth, may therefore be prioritized over other traffic without concern that it could starve the other traffic of bandwidth if it were to become nonconforming.     In some embodiments, nonconforming packets may not be counted by the bandwidth monitor 218 because they are sent only if there are no other conforming packets to be sent, and thus bandwidth is not taken from other conforming traffic by these packets. Bandwidth checks may be performed at packet boundaries and the check may be repeated as long as the packet fails to win arbitration. A nonconforming packet may become conforming while it is waiting to win arbitration. In this case, the packet switches from the lowest priority back to the priority to which it was originally assigned. If the bandwidth limit has been exceeded part way through the transmission of a packet, the packet may finish being sent as a conforming packet and not yield to another packet that has the same or lower priority in order to reduce packet fragmentation downstream in the link. In some embodiments, however, bandwidth checks may also be performed at FLIT boundaries. In such cases, a packet can change priority to Over-BW part way through the packet and other packets (from a lower priority level) can preempt.     FIG. 4 illustrates a packet frame consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure. The frame 400 may be generated by the source node 102 to forward one or more data packets to an intermediate node 122 and/or end node 126. Thus, frame 400 may be viewed as the ""sender node"" frame format. The frame 400 generally includes a header portion 402, and a payload portion 404. The header portion 402 may be 20 bytes in length, which may be a suitable size to support features of an HPC network fabric. The frame format shown may accommodate a payload of up to 4 KBytes. Source and destination addresses or location IDs (SLID 406, DLID 408) are each 16 bits long to provide a location addressing capability that exceeds 48K location IDs. The Virtual Lane (VL) field 410 may be configured to specify the virtual lane associated with the transmission of this packet. In this illustration, the VL field 410 is 4 bits long which allows for 16 possible lanes.     FIG. 5 illustrates a virtual lane group table 500 consistent with various embodiments of the present disclosure. Groups of VLs 502, may each be assigned a bandwidth limit or allocation, for example by the fabric manager, and bandwidth monitors may be used to check whether each group has exceeded its allocated link bandwidth during each arbitration cycle. Each implementation may decide on the number of groups to be supported. The bandwidth distribution may be assigned based on a percentage of use of the link bandwidth shared among the different groups. Table 500 illustrates an example of how bandwidth allocations 504 may be assigned to five different VL groups 502. This example illustrates that the sum of the bandwidth limits across all groups is allowed to exceed 100% of the link bandwidth. This is allowed because the fabric manager may specify a relatively high limit for management traffic (in this example, VL group 4) with the expectation that it will only rarely consume that much bandwidth. Thus, management traffic is allowed to have the required bandwidth when it is needed.     Bandwidth allocation for the remaining traffic (in this example VL groups 0-3) may be assigned on the assumption that management traffic is normally minimal and thus limits may be specified across the other traffic types (VL groups 0-3) which sum to 100%.     FIG. 6 illustrates a flowchart of operations 600 of one example embodiment consistent with the present disclosure. The operations provide a method for providing enhanced network communication. At operation 620, the bandwidth that is consumed by packets transmitted on each of a plurality of virtual lanes is measured. The virtual lanes are associated with a defined VL priority and an allocated share of network bandwidth. At operation 630, the VL priority is adjusted based on a comparison of the measured bandwidth to the allocated share of network bandwidth. The adjustment may include reducing the VL priority to a lowest value selected from a range of priorities (which may be pre-defined), if the measured bandwidth exceeds the allocated share of network bandwidth. At operation 640, the packets are transmitted based on the adjusted VL priority.     The foregoing includes example system architectures and methodologies. Modifications to the present disclosure are possible. The host processor 206 may include one or more processor cores and may be configured to execute system software. System software may include, for example, operating system code (e.g., OS kernel code) and local area network (LAN) driver code. LAN driver code may be configured to control, at least in part, the operation of the network controller 204. System memory may include I/O memory buffers configured to store one or more data packets that are to be transmitted by, or received by, network controller 204. Chipset circuitry may generally include ""North Bridge"" circuitry (not shown) to control communication between the processor, network controller 204 and system memory 208.     Node 102 and/or link partner 122 or 126 may further include an operating system (OS, not shown) to manage system resources and control tasks that are run on, e.g., node 102. For example, the OS may be implemented using Microsoft Windows, HP-UX, Linux, or UNIX, although other operating systems may be used. In some embodiments, the OS may be replaced by a virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor) which may provide a layer of abstraction for underlying hardware to various operating systems (virtual machines) running on one or more processing units. The operating system and/or virtual machine may implement one or more protocol stacks. A protocol stack may execute one or more programs to process packets. An example of a protocol stack is a TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol stack comprising one or more programs for handling (e.g., processing or generating) packets to transmit and/or receive over a network. A protocol stack may alternatively be comprised of a dedicated sub-system such as, for example, a TCP offload engine and/or network controller 204. The TCP offload engine circuitry may be configured to provide, for example, packet transport, packet segmentation, packet reassembly, error checking, transmission acknowledgements, transmission retries, etc., without the need for host CPU and/or software involvement.     The system memory 208 may comprise one or more of the following types of memory: semiconductor firmware memory, programmable memory, non- volatile memory, read only memory, electrically programmable memory, random access memory, flash memory, magnetic disk memory, and/or optical disk memory. Either additionally or alternatively system memory may comprise other and/or later-developed types of computer-readable memory.     Embodiments of the operations described herein may be implemented in a system that includes one or more tangible computer readable storage mediums having stored thereon, individually or in combination, instructions that when executed by one or more processors perform the methods. The processor may include, for example, a processing unit and/or programmable circuitry in the network controller 204, system processor 206 and/or other processing unit or programmable circuitry. Thus, it is intended that operations according to the methods described herein may be distributed across a plurality of physical devices, such as processing structures at several different physical locations. The storage device may include any type of tangible, non-transitory storage device, for example, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, compact disk read-only memories (CD-ROMs), compact disk rewritables (CD-RWs), and magneto-optical disks, semiconductor devices such as read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs) such as dynamic and static RAMs, erasable programmable read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs), flash memories, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of storage device suitable for storing electronic instructions.     ""Module,"" as used herein, may comprise, singly or in any combination circuitry and/or code and/or instructions sets (e.g., software, firmware, etc.). The terms ""circuitry"" or ""circuit"" as used in any embodiment herein, may comprise, for example, singly or in any combination, hardwired circuitry, programmable circuitry, state machine circuitry, and/or firmware that stores instructions executed by programmable circuitry. The circuitry may be embodied as an integrated circuit, such as an integrated circuit chip. Thus, the network controller (or network node or network switch) may be embodied as a stand-alone integrated circuit or may be incorporated as one of several components on an integrated circuit, which may also include a processor or CPU. In some embodiments, the various components, circuits and modules of the network controller or other systems may be combined in a system-on-a-chip (SoC) architecture. The SoC may be included as part of a server system or CPU.     Thus, the present disclosure provides systems, devices, methods and computer readable media for enabling enhanced Ethernet network communications.

[Solution] Provided is a motor. An electrically active part is provided with an insulating structure so that insulating properties between the electrically active part and one or more conductors near the electrically active part satisfy a certain safety standard regarding medical electrical equipment.,"Technical Field    [0001]    The present disclosure relates to a motor, an actuator, and a medical support arm apparatus.     Background Art    [0002]    Recently, in the medical field, support arm apparatuses are being used to support surgeries and examinations. For example, a method is proposed in which an observation unit such as a camera for observing a surgical site is provided on the front edge of an arm unit of a support arm apparatus, and the surgeon performs surgery while viewing an image captured by the observation unit. Also proposed is a method of causing a support arm apparatus to perform work that has been done manually in the past, such as supporting a treatment tool such as forceps with the arm unit of a support arm apparatus.     [0003]    At this point, generally, in medical electrical equipment (ME equipment), it is necessary to provide the insulation demanded by a certain safety standard (for example, the international safety standard IEC 060601-1) to protect the patient and the operator (surgeon). For example, in the case of a support arm apparatus having a movable mechanism in which an actuator is provided in a joint unit, there is demand to insulate the motor of the actuator so as to satisfy a certain safety standard.     [0004]    For example, as a technology related to the insulation of a motor, Patent Literature 1 discloses a technology whereby the outer casing of the motor is made up of an insulating resin. According to this technology, by having the thickness of the insulating resin constituting the outer casing satisfy a required thickness determined by a safety standard, it becomes possible to ensure high reliability with regard to safety factors such as shock prevention.     Citation List    Patent Literature    [0005]    Patent Literature 1: JP H8-308162A     Summary of Invention    Technical Problem    [0006]    However, in the case of applying a method of constructing the outer casing of the motor with an insulating resin of a certain thickness, like the technology described in Patent Literature 1, to a support arm apparatus, there is a possibility of the motor becoming bulkier, or in other words, the actuator may become bulkier, and as a result, the arm unit may be bulkier.     [0007]    On the other hand, if usage in the medical field is considered, there is demand for the arm unit of the support arm apparatus to be more compact. This is because if the configuration of the arm unit is large, there is a risk that the workspace of the surgeon performing surgery and the surgeon's field of view may be limited by the arm unit, thereby inhibiting smooth work.     [0008]    In this way, in a movable mechanism of medical electrical equipment such as the joint unit of a medical support arm apparatus, there is demand for a technology that achieves a more compact configuration and also ensures high safety by satisfying a certain safety standard. Accordingly, the present disclosure proposes a new and improved motor, actuator, and medical support arm apparatus capable of being configured more compactly and also capable of ensuring higher safety.     Solution to Problem    [0009]    According to the present disclosure, there is provided a motor. An electrically active part is provided with an insulating structure so that insulating properties between the electrically active part and one or more conductors near the electrically active part satisfy a certain safety standard regarding medical electrical equipment.     [0010]    According to the present disclosure, there is provided an actuator, including: a motor in which an electrically active part is provided with an insulating structure so that insulating properties between the electrically active part and one or more conductors near the electrically active part satisfy a certain safety standard regarding medical electrical equipment. The actuator is used in a drive mechanism of medical electrical equipment.     [0011]    According to the present disclosure, there is provided a medical support arm apparatus, including: an arm unit made up of a plurality of joint units; and a medical tool provided on a front edge of the arm unit. In a motor of an actuator provided in the joint unit, an electrically active part is provided with an insulating structure so that insulating properties between the electrically active part and one or more conductors near the electrically active part satisfy a certain safety standard regarding medical electrical equipment.     [0012]    According to the present disclosure, an electrically active part inside a motor is provided with an insulating structure so that the insulating properties between the electrically active part and one or more conductors near the electrically active part satisfy a certain safety standard regarding medical electrical equipment. Consequently, when such a motor is built into a movable mechanism, it is not necessary to provide an insulating structure between the motor and another member to which the motor is attached. Consequently, it becomes possible to realize a movable mechanism capable of being configured more compactly and also capable of ensuring higher safety.     Advantageous Effects of Invention    [0013]    According to the present disclosure as described above, it becomes possible to realize a movable mechanism capable of being configured more compactly and also capable of ensuring higher safety. Note that the effects described above are not necessarily limited, and along with or instead of the effects, any effect that is desired to be introduced in the present specification or other effects that can be expected from the present specification may be exhibited.

Description of Embodiment(s)    [0015]    Hereinafter, (a) preferred embodiment(s) of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the appended drawings. In this specification and the drawings, elements that have substantially the same function and structure are denoted with the same reference signs, and repeated explanation is omitted.     [0016]    Hereinafter, the description will proceed in the following order.1. Typical methods of insulating movable mechanism1-1. Method of covering motor with insulator1-2.

Supplement    [0017]    Herein, the present disclosure relates to the insulation of medical electrical equipment including a movable mechanism rotationally driven by an actuator. As discussed above, in medical electrical equipment, it is necessary to provide the insulation demanded by a certain safety standard. In the following description, the case in which the safety standard is IEC 060601-1 (corresponding to JIS T 0601-1 in JIS), which is used widely as an international safety standard for medical electrical equipment, will be described as an example. However, the present disclosure is not limited to such an example, and the safety standard applied to the medical electrical equipment may be another standard.     [0018]    According to IEC 060601-1, for example, certain insulating properties must be ensured between an electrically active part, such as the coil of a motor inside the medical electrical equipment, and a member of the medical electrical equipment that may be touched by people (such as the operator or the patient). Herein, in this specification, the ""electrically active part"" means a conductive portion intended to carry current during normal usage. In the case of a motor, components such as a coil, a harness for leading current to the coil from an external source, and a substrate that receives current from an external power source to which the harness may be connected correspond to the electrically active part.     [0019]    In a typical motor, the coil may be made up of enameled wire coated with an insulating sheath, but the insulating properties of enameled wire sheaths often do not satisfy the demands of IEC 060601-1. Consequently, in a typical motor, the motor itself is considered to be insufficiently insulated. Thus, in medical electrical equipment using a typical motor, the motor is provided with an insulating structure that satisfies the insulating properties stipulated by IEC 060601-1. Note that according to IEC 060601-1, the insulating structure may be realized by providing an insulator (solid insulation) having certain insulation performance, or by providing a certain clearance distance and a certain creepage distance, between the electrically active part and nearby conductors.     [0020]    In the following, first, typical existing methods of insulating the movable mechanism of medical electrical equipment will be described in (1. Typical methods of insulating movable mechanism). Next, preferred embodiments of the present disclosure conceived by the inventors will be described in (2. First embodiment) and (3. Second embodiment). Next, the advantageous effects and the like exhibited by the first and second embodiments described thus far will be summarized in (4. Summary of first and second embodiments). Furthermore, as an application example of a motor according to the first and second embodiments of the present disclosure, the configuration of a support arm apparatus including an actuator to which such a motor is applied will be described in (5. Application example).     (1. Typical methods of insulating movable mechanism)    [0021]    At this point, before describing preferred embodiments of the present disclosure, to further clarify the present disclosure, the results of an investigation by the inventors into typical existing methods of insulating a movable mechanism of medical electrical equipment will be described, and in addition, the background behind the inventors' conception of the present disclosure will be described.     (1-1. Method of covering motor with insulator)    [0022]    An example of a typical method of insulating a movable mechanism will be described with reference to FIG. 1. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of a typical insulated movable mechanism.     [0023]    In FIG. 1 , a movable mechanism of medical electrical equipment is illustrated schematically. Referring to FIG. 1 , a movable mechanism 60 is made up of a stationary part 620, a motor 610 connected to the stationary part 620, and a movable part 630 which is connected to a drive shaft of the motor 610 and which drives rotationally with respect to the stationary part 620 due to the driving of the motor 610. In the movable mechanism 60, the stationary part 620 and the movable part 630 correspond to parts that may be touched by the patient and the operator, and include an outer covering made of a metal chassis, for example. Note that in FIG. 1 , as well as in FIGS. 2 and 3 discussed later, in order to make the relationships among the arrangement of the respective members easier to understand, the respective members are shaded with different types of hatching for the sake of convenience.     [0024]    Note that in the following description, when the configuration of the movable mechanism and the motor are being described, the direction of the drive shaft of the motor (that is, the rotary axis direction) is also called the Z axis direction. Also, the two mutually orthogonal directions in the plane perpendicular to the Z axis direction are also called the X axis direction and the Y axis direction, respectively.     [0025]    As illustrated in the drawing, in the movable mechanism 60, solid insulation 640 (an insulator 640) is provided between the housing of the motor 610 and the stationary part 620, and also between the drive shaft of the motor 610 and the movable part 630. The insulator 640 is formed from an insulating resin or the like, for example, and the material, thickness, and the like are adjusted so as to satisfy the insulating properties stipulated by IEC 060601-1. Consequently, the insulating properties between the motor 610 and the stationary part 620, and also between the motor 610 and the movable part 630, satisfy the demands of IEC 060601-1, and the safety of the patient and the operator contacting the stationary part 620 and the movable part 630 is maintained. In this way, a method of covering the motor 610 with an insulator is given as one example of a typical method of insulating a movable mechanism. The technology described in Patent Literature 1 above may be considered to conform to this method.     (1-2. Method of covering movable mechanism with insulator)    [0026]    Another example of a typical method of insulating a movable mechanism will be described with reference to FIG. 2. FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating another example of a typical insulated movable mechanism.     [0027]    In FIG. 2 , similarly to FIG. 1 , a movable mechanism of medical electrical equipment is illustrated schematically. Referring to FIG. 2 , a movable mechanism 70 is made up of a stationary part 720, a motor 710 connected to the stationary part 720, and a movable part 730 which is connected to a drive shaft of the motor 710 and which drives rotationally with respect to the stationary part 720 due to the driving of the motor 710. In the movable mechanism 70, the stationary part 720 and the movable part 730 correspond to parts that may be touched by the patient and the operator, and include an outer covering made of a metal chassis, for example.     [0028]    As illustrated in the drawing, in the movable mechanism 70, solid insulation 740 (an insulator 740) is provided so as to cover the entire movable mechanism 70. The insulator 740 is formed from an insulating resin or the like, for example, and the material, thickness, and the like are adjusted so as to satisfy the insulating properties stipulated by IEC 060601-1. Consequently, the patient and the operator contact the stationary part 720 and the movable part 730 through the insulator 740 which ensures certain insulating properties, and thus the safety of the patient and the operator is maintained. In this way, a method of covering the movable mechanism 70 with an insulator is given as another example of a typical method of insulating a movable mechanism.     (1-3. Investigation into typical insulation methods)    [0029]    Herein, recently, in the medical field, support arm apparatuses are being used to support surgeries and examinations. In a support arm apparatus including a drive shaft, by providing an actuator in a joint unit corresponding to the drive shaft, and controlling the driving of the motor of the actuator, the position and the orientation of the arm unit is controlled. In this way, the joint unit of a medical support arm apparatus corresponds to the movable mechanisms 60 and 70 discussed above, and insulating properties conforming to IEC 060601-1 are demanded of the joint unit.     [0030]    On the other hand, in a medical support arm apparatus, there is demand for the arm unit to be more compact. This is because if the configuration of the arm unit is large, there is a risk that the workspace of the surgeon performing surgery and the surgeon's field of view may be limited by the arm unit, thereby inhibiting smooth work. Also, since many medical staff members and other medical equipment exist in the operating room, a more compact medical support arm apparatus is demanded so as not to interfere with these nearby people and objects.     [0031]    Given the above circumstances, consider the case of applying the typical insulating methods described above to the joint unit of a medical support arm apparatus. First, in the case of applying the method of covering the motor 610 with an insulator, the motor 610 becomes bulkier, and thus the actuator becomes bulkier, and as a result, there are concerns that the arm unit may become bulkier. Also, with this method, since the insulator 640 is also provided on the drive shaft of the motor 610, there is a possibility that the output torque of the motor 610 may be limited so that the insulator 640 does not become deformed or ruptured. Attempting to ensure the output torque of the motor 610 requires a bulkier insulator 640 to improve the strength of the insulator 640, and the arm unit becomes even bulkier.     [0032]    Meanwhile, in the case of applying the method of covering the entire movable mechanism 70 with an insulator, the entire arm unit becomes covered with an insulator, and thus there are obvious concerns that the arm unit may become bulkier. In addition, since the insulator 740 must be disposed so as not to inhibit the operation of the arm unit and also so that the arm unit does become exposed even when operated, the number of component parts increases, and the design difficulty also increases. Increased complexity in the configuration also leads to concerns that assembly work and maintenance work may become complicated. Furthermore, by covering the entire arm unit with an insulator, the heat produced by the motor and the like is less readily dissipated externally, and there is also a risk that normal operation of the medical electrical equipment may be inhibited.     [0033]    In this way, with typical existing technologies, in an actuator provided in a movable mechanism of medical electrical equipment such as the joint unit of a medical support arm apparatus, it is difficult to achieve a more compact configuration and also ensure high safety by satisfying a certain safety standard. Accordingly, in light of these circumstances, the inventors investigated technologies capable of achieving a more compact configuration while also ensuring high safety by satisfying a certain safety standard in an actuator, and as a result, conceived the preferred embodiments of the present disclosure indicated below. The following describes in detail preferred embodiments of the present disclosure conceived by the inventors.     (2. First embodiment)    [0034]    A configuration of a motor according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to FIGS. 3 to 5 . FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating an example configuration of a movable mechanism of medical electrical equipment to which a motor according to a first embodiment has been applied. FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of a plane (X-Y plane) perpendicular to a drive shaft of a motor according to a first embodiment. FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of a plane (Y-Z plane) passing through and parallel to a drive shaft of a motor according to a first embodiment.     [0035]    In FIG. 3 , a movable mechanism of medical electrical equipment to which a motor according to a first embodiment has been applied is illustrated schematically. Referring to FIG. 3 , a movable mechanism 10 is made up of a stationary part 120, a motor 110 connected to the stationary part 120, and a movable part 130 which is connected to a drive shaft of the motor 110 and which drives rotationally with respect to the stationary part 120 due to the driving of the motor 110. In the movable mechanism 10, the stationary part 120 and the movable part 130 correspond to parts that may be touched by the patient and the operator. For example, the movable mechanism 10 corresponds to a joint unit constituting an arm unit of a medical support arm apparatus. Also, for example, the stationary part 120 and the movable part 130 are parts corresponding to links constituting the arm unit of the medical support arm apparatus, and including an outer covering made of a metal chassis, for example.     [0036]    As discussed later with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5 , in the first embodiment, inside the motor 110, an electrically active part such as a coil 113 is provided with an insulating structure in which the insulating properties between the electrically active part and one or more conductors near the electrically active part satisfy a certain safety standard (for example, IEC 060601-1). Note that conducting members existing near the electrically active part include various types of conductive components from among the components constituting the motor, such as an iron core, a motor outer covering (housing), bearings, a rotor shaft (drive shaft), and a magnet. Consequently, in the first embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 3 , it is not necessary to provide an insulator between the motor 110 and the stationary part 120 and also between the motor 110 and the movable part 130, or to provide an insulator so as to cover the stationary part 120 and the movable part 130. Thus, according to the first embodiment, it becomes possible to make the movable mechanism 10 more compact compared to the typical methods discussed earlier.     [0037]    A configuration of the motor 110 according to the first embodiment will be described in further detail with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5 . Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5 , the motor 110 is equipped with a drive shaft 111, an approximately cylindrical housing 115 that rotatably supports the drive shaft 111 through bearings (not illustrated), a magnet 112, which is provided so as to cover, in the circumferential direction, part of the outer circumference of the drive shaft 111 in the rotary shaft direction, and which rotates together with the drive shaft 111, an approximately cylindrical coil 113 provided inside the housing 115 so as to face the magnet 112, and an approximately cylindrical back yoke 114 provided on the inner wall of the housing 115 so as to face the magnet 112 through the coil 113. Additionally, in the motor 110, solid insulation 116 (an insulator 116) is provide so as to cover the perimeter of the coil 113.     [0038]    By applying a current to the coil 113 and also switching the direction of the current at appropriate timings, the interaction between the magnetic field produced by the coil 113 and the magnetic field from the magnet 112 cause the drive shaft 111 to rotate. In addition, the back yoke 114 is a member provided to minimize magnetic flux leakage and raise the magnetic flux density linking the coil 113, and is formed by layering multiple thin plates made of soft magnetic material, such as an iron alloy with added Si, for example.     [0039]    In this way, the motor 110 corresponds to a typical brushless motor that is referred to as coreless, in which the insulator 116 is provided between the coil 113 and nearby conductors (such as the back yoke 114 and the housing 115, for example). Note that for the drive shaft 111, the magnet 112, the coil 113, the back yoke 114, and the housing 115, various configurations used in typical coreless brushless motors may be applied, and thus a detailed description of these members will be reduced or omitted.     [0040]    Herein, in the motor 110, in order to satisfy the insulating properties stipulated by IEC 060601-1, it is necessary to provide the electrically active part, that is, the coil 113, with an insulating structure that satisfies the insulating properties stipulated by IEC 060601-1. According to IEC 060601-1, the insulating structure may be realized by providing an insulator     [0041]    (solid insulation) having certain insulation performance, or by providing a certain clearance distance and a certain creepage distance, between the electrically active part and nearby conductors. At this point, the insulating properties demanded of the insulator, as well as the distances demanded of the clearance distance and the creepage distance, may be decided based on IEC 060601-1 according to factors such as the power source voltage and the usage environment of the motor 110, for example.     [0042]    In the first embodiment, the insulator 116 is provided so as to cover the perimeter of the coil 113, as discussed above. Additionally, the material and the thickness of the insulator 116 are adjusted so as to satisfy the insulating properties stipulated by IEC 060601-1. Note that the insulator 116 may be a sheet-like member made of a resinous material, for example. However, the first embodiment is not limited to such an example, and any of various types of known materials and shapes may be used as the insulator 116, insofar as the desired insulating properties may be realized.     [0043]    On the other hand, in the illustrated example, on part of the coil 113, there exists an opening not covered by the insulator 116. This opening may be the part where a harness or the like for leading current from an external source to the coil 113 is connected to the coil 113, for example. In the first embodiment, factors such as the positional relationship between the coil 113 and the housing 115, the positional relationship between the coil 113 and the back yoke 114, and/or the formation position of the insulator 116 (that is, the formation position of the opening on the insulator 116) are adjusted so that enough distance as stipulated by IEC 060601-1 is ensured as the clearance distance and the creepage distance between the coil 113 and the nearby conductors through the opening. In FIG. 5 , a simulated clearance distance dcl between the coil 113 and the housing 115 and a simulated creepage distance dcr between the coil 113 and the back yoke 114 are illustrated as an example. Note that when a harness is connected to the coil 113 as above, the harness may also be an electrically active part, and thus the harness may also be subjected to treatment, such as being covered by the insulator 116, or by providing a certain clearance distance and a certain creepage distance around the harness, for example.     [0044]    In the motor 110 according to the first embodiment, as described above, the insulator 116 satisfying the stipulations of IEC 060601-1, as well as a certain clearance distance and a certain creepage distance satisfying the stipulations of IEC 060601-1, are provided between the electrically active part, namely the coil 113, and nearby conductors. Consequently, since the insulating properties stipulated by IEC 060601-1 are ensured for the members exposed to the outside of the motor 110, such as the drive shaft 111 and the housing 115, it is not necessary to provide an additional insulator between the motor 110 and nearby members, as illustrated in FIG. 3 . Thus, according to the first embodiment, it becomes possible to make the movable mechanism 10 more compact, while still satisfying the stipulations of IEC 060601-1.     [0045]    Note that in the example illustrated in FIG. 5 , to insulate the coil 113, the perimeter of the coil 113 is covered by the insulator 116, while in addition, a certain clearance distance and a certain creepage distance are ensured at an opening not covered by the insulator 116. However, the first embodiment is not limited to such an example. As discussed above, according to the IEC 060601-1, it is sufficient to ensure insulating properties by providing an insulator having certain insulation performance between the electrically active part, namely the coil 113, and nearby conductors, or by providing a certain clearance distance and a certain creepage distance. The method of realizing an insulating structure for insulating the coil 113 is not limited to the example illustrated in the drawings.     [0046]    For example, if it is possible to provide a certain clearance distance and a certain creepage distance between the coil 113 and nearby conductors over the entire perimeter of the coil 113, the insulator 116 does not need to be provided. Alternatively, if it is possible to cover with the insulator 116 the entire perimeter of electrically active parts, such as the coil 113 and the harness discussed above, for example, the certain clearance distance and the certain creepage distance do not need to be provided on the perimeters of these electrically active parts. The way in which to realize an insulating structure may be configured appropriately according to factors such as the structure of the motor 110.     [0047]    Generally, however, in a motor, it is known that if the distance between the coil and the magnet is long, the interaction of the magnetic fields between the two will weaken, and the output torque of the motor will decrease. By providing an insulating structure, the distance between the coil 113 and the magnet 112 may also vary, and thus when providing the motor 110 with an insulating structure, preferably the specific configuration of the insulating structure is decided while also accounting for the performance demanded on the motor 110 according to the application.     [0048]    Also, in the example illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 , the case of insulating the coil 113 as an example of the electrically active part is illustrated, but the first embodiment is not limited to such an example. Inside the motor 110, other components that may function as an electrically active part may exist besides the coil 113, such as the harness discussed earlier, and a substrate that receives current from an external power source to which the harness may be connected. In the first embodiment, if other electrically active parts besides the coil 113 exist, these other electrically active parts may also be provided with an insulating structure conforming to IEC 060601-1, similarly to the coil 113.     [0049]    The above thus describes a configuration of the motor 110 according to the first embodiment with reference to FIGS. 3 to 5 . Note that the configuration of the motor 110 is not limited to the example illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 , and the motor 110 may also be configured so that the insulator 116 is provided for any of various known types of coreless brushless motors.     (3. Second embodiment)    [0050]    A configuration of a motor according to the second embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7 . FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view of a plane (X-Y plane) perpendicular to a drive shaft of a motor according to the second embodiment. FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of a plane (Y-Z plane) passing through and parallel to a drive shaft of a motor according to the second embodiment. Note that the configuration of the movable mechanism that may be installed onboard the motor according to the second embodiment is similar to the movable mechanism 10 according to the first embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3 . Consequently, in the following description of the second embodiment, the configuration of the motor according to the second embodiment will be described primarily, whereas description of the movable mechanism that may be installed onboard the motor will be reduced or omitted.     [0051]    Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7 , the motor 210 according to the second embodiment is equipped with a drive shaft 211, an approximately cylindrical housing 215 that rotatably supports the drive shaft 211 through bearings (not illustrated), a magnet 212, which is provided so as to cover, in the circumferential direction, part of the outer circumference of the drive shaft 211 in the rotary shaft direction, and which rotates together with the drive shaft 211, multiple stator cores 214 projecting inward from the inner wall of the housing 215, and coils 213 which are configured by winding conductive wire around the perimeter of each stator core 214 and which are provided so as to face the magnet 212. Additionally, in the motor 210, an insulator 216 (insulator 216) is provided so as to cover the perimeter of the coil 213 provided on each stator core 214.     [0052]    By applying a current to the coils 213 and also switching the direction of the current at appropriate timings, the interaction between the magnetic field produced by the coils 213 and the magnetic field from the magnet 212 cause the drive shaft 211 to rotate. In this way, the motor 210 corresponds to a typical brushless motor having stator cores 214, in which the insulators 216 are provided between the coils 213 and nearby conductors (such as the stator cores 214 and the housing 215, for example). Note that for the drive shaft 211, the magnet 212, the coils 213, the stator cores 214, and the housing 215, various configurations used in typical brushless motors having stator cores may be applied, and thus a detailed description of these members will be reduced or omitted.     [0053]    Similarly to the first embodiment, the material and the thickness of the insulators 216 covering the coils 213 are adjusted so as to satisfy the insulating properties stipulated by IEC 060601-1. The insulators 216 may be made of a resinous material, for example. However, the second embodiment is not limited to such an example, and any of various types of known materials and shapes may be used as the insulators 216, insofar as the desired insulating properties may be realized.     [0054]    In addition, as illustrated in FIG. 7 , likewise in the second embodiment, an opening which is for connecting a harness or the like to the coils 213 and which is not covered by the insulators 216 may also exist in part of the coils 213. In this way, if an opening not covered by the insulators 216 exists in part of the coils 213, factors such as the positional relationship between the coils 213 and the housing 215, the positional relationship between the coils 213 and the stator cores 214, and/or the formation position of the insulators 216 (that is, the formation position of the opening on the insulators 116) may be adjusted so that enough distance as stipulated by IEC 060601-1 is ensured as the clearance distance and the creepage distance between the coils 213 and the nearby conductors through the opening (for the sake of simplicity, in FIG. 7 , illustration of the clearance distance dcl and the creepage distance dcr is omitted). Note that, similarly to the first embodiment, when harnesses are connected to the coils 213 as above, the harnesses may also be subjected to treatment, such as being covered by the insulators 216, or by providing a certain clearance distance and a certain creepage distance around the harnesses, for example.     [0055]    As described above, in the motor 210 according to the second embodiment, similarly to the motor 110 according to the first embodiment, the insulators 216 satisfying the stipulations of IEC 060601-1, as well as a certain clearance distance and a certain creepage distance satisfying the stipulations of IEC 060601-1, likewise are provided between the electrically active part, namely the coils 213, and nearby conductors. Consequently, since the insulating properties stipulated by IEC 060601-1 are ensured for the members exposed to the outside of the motor 210, such as the drive shaft 211 and the housing 215, it is not necessary to provide an additional insulator between the motor 210 and nearby members in the case of applying the motor 210 to the movable mechanism 10 as illustrated in FIG. 3 . Thus, likewise in the second embodiment, it becomes possible to make the movable mechanism 10 more compact, while still satisfying the stipulations of IEC 060601-1.     [0056]    Note that, similarly to the first embodiment, in the second embodiment, it is likewise sufficient to ensure insulating properties by providing insulators having certain insulation performance between the electrically active part, namely the coils 213, and nearby conductors, or by providing a certain clearance distance and a certain creepage distance. The method of realizing an insulating structure for insulating the coils 213 is not limited to the example illustrated in the drawings. When providing the motor 210 with an insulating structure, preferably the insulating structure is decided while also accounting for changes in the performance of the motor 210 due to providing the insulating structure. Furthermore, in the example illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7 , the case of insulating the coils 113 as an example of the electrically active part is illustrated, but if other electrically active parts besides the coils 213 exist, these other electrically active parts may also be provided with an insulating structure conforming to IEC 060601-1, similarly to the coils 213.     [0057]    The above thus describes a configuration of the motor 210 according to the second embodiment with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7 . Note that the configuration of the motor 210 is not limited to the example illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7 , and the motor 210 may also be configured so that the insulator 216 is provided for any of various known types of brushless motors having stator cores.     (4. Summary of first and second embodiments)    [0058]    As described above, in the motors 110 and 210 according to the first and second embodiments, inside the motors 110 and 210, the electrically active part is provided with an insulating structure in which the insulating properties between the electrically active part and nearby conductors satisfies a certain safety standard. Consequently, on the outside of the motors 110 and 210, it is not necessary to provide an insulating structure between the motors 110 and 210 and other members that contact the motors 110 and 210, and the motors 110 and 210 may be attached to such members directly. For this reason, it becomes possible to make the overall configuration of the movable mechanism 10 provided with the motor 110 or 210 more compact, while still ensuring the insulating properties stipulated by the certain safety standard.     [0059]    Additionally, since the motors 110 and 210 may be attached directly to the metal chassis of the outer covering of other members (for example, the stationary part 120 and the movable part 130 illustrated in FIG. 3 ), heat produced by the motors 110 and 210 may be dissipated by the metal chassis, thereby making it possible to minimize rises in the temperature of the medical electrical equipment overall.     [0060]    Herein, as described in (1. Typical methods of insulating movable mechanism) above, in the method of covering the motor 610 with an insulator, the drive shaft of the motor 610 is connected to the movable part 630 through the insulator 640, and thus there is a possibility that the output torque of the motor 610 may be limited so that the insulator 640 does not become deformed or ruptured. On the other hand, according to the first and second embodiments, as above, the drive shaft of the motors 110 and 210 may be attached directly to the movable part 130. Consequently, since the motor housing and the metal chassis of the movable part 130 may be used as strengthening components, the output torque of the motor 110 is not limited excessively compared to the case of the interposed insulator 640.     [0061]    Additionally, as also described in (1. Typical methods of insulating movable mechanism) above, in the method of covering the entire movable mechanism 70 with an insulator, since the insulator 740 must be disposed so as not to inhibit the operation of the arm unit and also so that the arm unit does become exposed even when operated, there is a risk that the number of component parts may increase, and the design difficulty may also increase. On the other hand, according to the first and second embodiments, as above, the drive shaft of the motors 110 and 210 may be attached directly to the movable part 130, and thus the configuration may be simplified, and more lightweight and lower-cost medical electrical equipment may be realized.     [0062]    Note that in the first and second embodiments described above, the case in which the motors 110 and 210 are brushless motors is described, but the present disclosure is not limited to such an example. The type of motor to which the insulating structure according to the first and second embodiments may be applied is not particularly limited, and the insulating structure may be applied to various known types of motors.     (5. Application example)    [0063]    As described above, the motors 110 and 210 according to the first and second embodiments have insulating properties that satisfy the IEC 060601-1 standard for medical electrical equipment. At this point, as one example of the application of the motors 110 and 210 to medical electrical equipment, a case in which the motors 110 and 210 are used in an actuator provided in a joint unit of a medical support arm apparatus used for medical procedures such as surgeries and examinations will be described. However, the medical electrical equipment to which the motors 110 and 210 may be applied is not limited to such an example, and the motors 110 and 210 may be applied to various types of medical electrical equipment having a drive mechanism.     (5-1. Overview of support arm apparatus)    [0064]    Before describing in detail the configuration of a support arm apparatus to which the motors 110 and 210 according to the first and second embodiments may be applied, a state of surgery using such a support arm apparatus will be described, and in addition, the features demanded of a medical support arm apparatus will be described.     [0065]    A state of surgery using a support arm apparatus will be described with reference to FIG. 8. FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram illustrating a state of surgery using a support arm apparatus.     [0066]    FIG. 1 illustrates a state in which a surgeon 520 is using a surgical treatment tool 521, such as a scalpel, tweezers, or forceps, to perform surgery on a patient 540 lying on an operating table 530. Beside the operating table 530, a support arm apparatus 510 to which the motors 110 and 210 according to the first and second embodiments may be applied is provided.     [0067]    The support arm apparatus 510 is equipped with a base unit 511 which acts as a base, and an arm unit 512 which extends from the base unit 511. Also, although omitted from illustration, the support arm apparatus 510 is equipped with a control device that controls the operation of the support arm apparatus 510 (corresponding to the control device 430 illustrated in FIG. 9 to be discussed later).     [0068]    The arm unit 512 includes multiple joint units 513a, 513b, and 513c, multiple links 514a and 514b joined by the joint units 513a and 513b, and an imaging unit 515 joined to the front edge of the arm unit 512 by the joint unit 513c. The joint units 513a to 513c are provided with an actuator 300 illustrated in FIG. 10 to be discussed later, and the joint units 513a to 513c are configured to be rotatable about a certain rotary shaft according to the driving of the actuator 300. By controlling the driving of the actuator 300 with the above control device, the rotational angle of each of the joint units 513a to 513c is controlled, and the driving of the arm unit 512 is controlled.     [0069]    The motors 110 and 210 according to the first and second embodiments described above may be applied favorably as the motor of the actuator 300. Consequently, the actuator 300, or in other words, the joint units 513a to 513c may be made more compact, thereby making it possible to make the overall arm unit 512 more compact as well.     [0070]    Note that FIG. 8 illustrates a simplified configuration of the arm unit 512 for the sake of simplicity, but in actuality, factors such as the numbers of the joint units 513a to 513c and the links 514a and 514b, their arrangement, and the directions of the drive shafts (rotary shafts) of the joint units 513a to 513c, may be set appropriately so that the arm unit 512 has the desired degrees of freedom. For example, the arm unit 512 preferably may be configured to have six or more degrees of freedom. As a result, it becomes possible to move the imaging unit 515 freely within the movable range of the arm unit 512.     [0071]    The imaging unit 515 is an example of an observation unit for observing the surgical site of the patient 540, and is a device such as a camera capable of capturing a moving image and/or a still image of an imaging target, for example. Other examples of the observation unit include an endoscope or a microscope, for example. In this specification, a support arm apparatus in which such an observation unit that observes the surgical site of the patient 540 is provided on the front edge of the arm unit 512 is also called an observation device.     [0072]    When performing surgery, as illustrated in FIG. 8 , the position and the orientation of the arm unit 512 and the imaging unit 515 are controlled by the support arm apparatus 510 so that the imaging unit 515 provided on the front edge of the arm unit 512 captures an image of the surgical site of the patient 540. In the operating room, a display device 550 is installed at a position facing the surgeon 520, and an image of the surgical site captured by the imaging unit 515 is displayed on the display device 550. The surgeon 520 performs various treatments while observing the image of the surgical site displayed on the display device 550.     [0073]    Note that the front edge unit provided on the front edge of the arm unit 512 is not limited to an observation unit such as the imaging unit 515, and may also be any of various types of medical tools. Such medical tools may include various operating tools, such as forceps and retractors, for example, besides the observation unit discussed above. In the past, since these medical tools were manipulated manually, surgery required a large number of medical staff, but by having the support arm apparatus 510 manipulate these medical tools, it becomes possible to perform surgery with fewer people.     [0074]    The above thus describes a state of surgery using the support arm apparatus 510 with reference to FIG. 8 . In the example illustrated in FIG. 8 , the support arm apparatus 510 is used for surgery, but in cases in which a unit used for examination, such as an endoscope, is provided as the front edge unit, for example, the support arm apparatus 510 may also be used for the purpose of examination.     [0075]    Herein, in the support arm apparatus 510 for medical use as described above, the arm unit 512 is taken to be positioned near the surgical site during surgery or examination. Consequently, if the configuration of the arm unit 512 is large, there is a possibility that the workspace of the surgeon 520 may become limited, and performing treatment smoothly may become difficult. Also, as illustrated in the drawing, in the case in which the surgeon 520 performs surgery while referring to an image on the display device 550, since the arm unit 512 may be positioned in between the surgeon 520 and the display device 550, if the configuration of the arm unit 512 is large, there is a risk that the visual field of the surgeon 520 observing the display device 550 may become obstructed, and the work of the surgeon 520 may be inhibited.     [0076]    In this way, in order to perform surgery or examination more smoothly, there is demand for the arm unit 512 of the support arm apparatus 510 for medical use to be more compact. According to this application example, by providing each of the joint units 513a to 513c with the actuator 300 having the motor 110 or 210 according to the first or second embodiment installed onboard, the arm unit 512 may be configured more compactly, thereby making it possible to meet the above demand.     [0077]    Hereinafter, a configuration of a support arm apparatus according to the present application example will be described in further detail.     (5-2. Overall configuration of support arm apparatus)    [0078]    An overall configuration of a support arm apparatus to which the motors 110 and 210 according to the first and second embodiments may be applied will be described with reference to FIG. 9. FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating an example of an overall configuration of a support arm apparatus to which the motors 110 and 210 according to the first and second embodiments may be applied.     [0079]    Referring to FIG. 9 , the support arm apparatus 400 is equipped with a base unit 410, an arm unit 420, and a control device 430. Similarly to the support arm apparatus 510 illustrated in FIG. 8 discussed above, the support arm apparatus 400 is a medical support arm apparatus that may be applied favorably to procedures such as surgeries and examinations.     [0080]    The base unit 410 is the base of the support arm apparatus 400, and the arm unit 420 extends from the base unit 410. The base unit 410 is provided with casters, and thus the support arm apparatus 400 contacts the floor through the casters, and is movable across the floor by the casters.     [0081]    The arm unit 420 includes a plurality of joint units 421a to 421f, a plurality of links 422a to 422c that are connected with one another by the joint units 421a to 421f, and an imaging unit 423 installed at the front edge of the arm unit 420.     [0082]    The links 422a to 422c are rod-like members, one end of the link 422a is connected with the base unit 410 through the joint unit 421a, the other end of the link 422a is connected with one end of the link 422b through the joint unit 421b, and the other end of the link 422b is connected with one end of the link 422c through the joint units 421c and 421d. Further, the imaging unit 423 is connected to the front edge of the arm unit 420, that is, the other end of the link 422c through the joint units 421e and 421f. As described above, the arm shape extending from the base unit 410 is configured such that the base unit 410 serves as a support point, and the ends of the plurality of links 422a to 422c are connected with one another through the joint units 421a to 421f.     [0083]    The imaging unit 423 is an example of an observation unit for observing a surgical site, and is a device such as a camera capable of capturing a moving image and/or a still image of an imaging target, for example. The imaging unit 423 corresponds to the imaging unit 515 illustrated in FIG. 8 discussed above. An image of the patient's surgical site captured by the imaging unit 423 is displayed on a display device (not illustrated) provided in the operating room, for example, and the surgeon performs surgery while observing the image of the patient's surgical site displayed on the display device. In this way, the support arm apparatus 400 may be an observation apparatus 400 in which an observation unit is attached to the front edge of the arm unit 420. As discussed earlier, devices such as an endoscope or a microscope, for example, may also be provided as the observation unit.     [0084]    However, the front edge unit provided on the front edge of the arm unit 420 is not limited to an observation unit, and any of various treatment tools, such as forceps or a retractor, for example, may also be connected to the front edge of the arm unit 420.     [0085]    The joint units 521a to 521f are provided with an actuator 300 illustrated in FIG. 10 to be discussed later, and the joint units 521a to 521f are configured to be rotatable about a certain rotary shaft according to the driving of the actuator 300. The driving of the actuator 300 is controlled by the control device 430. By respectively controlling the driving of the actuator 300 in each of the joint units 421a to 421f, driving of the arm unit 420 is controlled so as to extend or contract (fold up) the arm unit 420, for example.     [0086]    In this application example, the motor 110 or 210 according to the first or second embodiment described earlier may be installed onboard the actuator 300 of each of the joint units 421a to 421f. Consequently, the actuator 300, or in other words, the joint units 421a to 421f may be made more compact, thereby making it possible to make the overall arm unit 420 more compact as well. Note that a configuration of the actuator 300 will be described in detail in (5-3. Configuration of actuator) below.     [0087]    Note that in the example illustrated in the drawing, the support arm apparatus 400 includes six joint units 421a to 421f, and six degrees of freedom are realized with respect to the driving of the arm unit 420. By configuring the arm unit 420 to have six degrees of freedom, the imaging unit 423 may be moved freely within the movable range of the arm unit 420. Consequently, it becomes possible to use the imaging unit 423 to image the surgical site from a variety of angles and distances. However, the configuration of the arm unit 420 is not limited to the example illustrated in the drawing, and factors such as the numbers of the joint units 421a to 421f and the links 422a to 422c, their arrangement, and the directions of the drive shafts of the joint units 421a to 421f, may be set appropriately so that the arm unit 420 has the desired degrees of freedom. However, in consideration of freedom in the position and the orientation of the imaging unit 423, the arm unit 420 preferably may be configured to have six or more degrees of freedom.     [0088]    The control device 430 is made up of a processor, such as a central processing unit (CPU) or a digital signal processor (DSP), for example, or a microcontroller with these processors installed onboard. By executing signal processing according to a certain program, the control device 430 controls the driving of the support arm apparatus 400.     [0089]    The method of controlling the support arm apparatus 400 is not particularly limited, and the operation of the support arm apparatus 400 may be controlled by any of various known control methods, such as position control or force control. In the case of controlling the support arm apparatus 400 by position control, an input device such as a controller for operating the arm unit 420 may be provided. In the case of controlling the arm unit 420 by force control, the operation of the arm unit 420 may be controlled so that a user touches and operates the arm unit 420 directly, for example, and in response to an operation attempting to move the arm unit 420, the arm unit 420 moves in the direction of the force applied to the arm unit 420. Note that since any of various known methods may be used as the specific methods of controlling the support arm apparatus 400 by position control or force control, a detailed description is omitted herein.     [0090]    Note that in the example illustrated in the drawing, the control device 430 is connected to the base unit 410 via a cable, but a component such as a control board having functions similar to the control device 430 may also be provided internally inside the base unit 410.     [0091]    The above thus references FIG. 9 to describe an overall configuration of the support arm apparatus 400 to which the motors 110 and 210 according to the first and second embodiments may be applied.     (5-3. Configuration of actuator)    [0092]    A configuration of the actuator provided in each of the joint units 421a to 421f of the support arm apparatus 400 illustrated in FIG. 9 will be described with reference to FIG. 10. FIG. 10 is an exploded perspective view illustrating an example configuration of an actuator provided in each of the joint units 421a to 421f of the support arm apparatus 400 illustrated in FIG. 9 .     [0093]    Referring to FIG. 10 , the actuator 300 is equipped with a motor 310, a reduction gear 320, an input shaft encoder 330, an output shaft encoder 340, an output shaft 350, and a housing 360. In the actuator 300, the rotation of the rotary shaft of the motor 310 is reduced by the reduction gear 320 at a certain reduction ratio, and transmitted to other downstream members via the output shaft 350. As a result, the other members are driven.     [0094]    The housing 360 has an approximately cylindrical shape, in which the respective components are housed internally. In a state in which each of the structural members is housed inside the housing 360, the actuator 300 is built into each of the joint units 421a to 421f of the support arm apparatus 400 discussed above.     [0095]    The motor 310 is a driving mechanism that, when given a certain command value (current value), causes a rotary axis to rotate at a rotational velocity corresponding to the command value, and thereby produces driving force. In this application example, the motor 110 or 210 according to the first or second embodiment discussed earlier is used as the motor 310. Consequently, it is not necessary to provide an insulating structure such as an insulator between the rotary shaft or the outer covering of the motor 310 and other adjacent members, and thus it becomes possible to make the actuator 300 more compact.     [0096]    The reduction gear 320 is joined to the rotary shaft of the motor 310. The reduction gear 320 reduces by a certain reduction ratio the rotational velocity of the rotary shaft of the joined motor 310 (in other words, the rotational velocity of the input shaft), and transmits to the output shaft 350. In this application example, the configuration of the reduction gear 320 is not limited to a specific configuration, and any of various known reduction gears may be used as the reduction gear 320. However, for the reduction gear 320, it is preferable to use one capable of accurately setting the reduction ratio, such as a Harmonic Drive (registered trademark), for example. In addition, the reduction ratio of the reduction gear 320 may be set appropriately according to the application of the actuator 300. For example, in the case of applying the actuator 300 to the joint units 421a to 421f of the support arm apparatus 400 as in the present application example, a reduction gear 320 having a reduction ratio of approximately 1:100 preferably may be used.     [0097]    The input shaft encoder 330 detects the rotational angle of the input shaft (that is, the rotational angle of the motor 310). The output shaft encoder 340 detects the rotational angle of the output shaft 350. The configuration of the input shaft encoder 330 and the output shaft encoder 340 is not limited, and any of various known types of rotary encoders, such as magnetic encoders or optical encoders, for example, may be used as the input shaft encoder 330 and the output shaft encoder 340.     [0098]    The above thus references FIG. 10 to describe a configuration of the actuator 300 to which the motors 110 and 210 according to the first and second embodiments may be applied. Note that the actuator 300 additionally may be provided with other configuration elements besides the illustrated configuration elements. For example, the actuator 300 additionally may be provided with various types of members that may be included in a typical actuator, such as a driver circuit (driver integrated circuit (IC)) that induces rotational driving in the motor 310 by supplying a current to the motor 310, or a torque sensor that detects the torque acting on the output shaft 350. Particularly, in the case in which the operation of the support arm apparatus 400 is controlled by force control, a torque sensor preferably may be provided in the actuator 300 to detect the force acting on the arm unit 420.

BACKGROUND ART    [0002]    A typical electronic cigarette includes a liquid absorbing element and a heating element in the atomizing chamber. The liquid absorbing element extends out of the atomizing chamber to absorb tobacco liquid. However, the liquid absorbing element may absorb too much tobacco liquid, and the tobacco liquid may leak when the atomizer shakes.

[0009]    The term ""outside"" refers to a region that is beyond the outermost confines of a physical object. The term ""inside"" indicates that at least a portion of a region is partially contained within a boundary formed by the object. The term ""substantially"" is defined to be essentially conforming to the particular dimension, shape or other word that substantially modifies, such that the component need not be exact. For example, substantially cylindrical means that the object resembles a cylinder, but can have one or more deviations from a true cylinder. The term ""comprising,"" when utilized, means ""including, but not necessarily limited to""; it specifically indicates open-ended inclusion or membership in the so-described combination, group, series and the like.     [0010]    Referring to FIGS. 1-2 , an atomizer 100 for an electronic cigarette is shown. The atomizer 100 includes a housing 20, a mouthpiece 10 detachably connected with the housing 20, and a liquid tank 30 in the housing 20. The liquid tank 30 defines a liquid chamber 32 for storing tobacco liquid, and includes an atomizing chamber 362, an atomizing assembly 37 in the atomizing chamber 362, and an air pipe 31 communicating the atomizing chamber 362 and the mouthpiece 10. The atomizing chamber 362 is defined by an atomizing cup 36, and is separated from the liquid chamber 32 by the atomizing cup 36. The atomizing assembly 37 is configured (i.e., structured and arranged) for generating aerosol from the tobacco liquid. The aerosol is expelled from the mouthpiece 10 through the air pipe 31.     [0011]    Referring to FIGS. 2 , 3 and 5 , a movable element 34 and an elastic element 35 are arranged in the liquid chamber 32. The movable element 34 includes a fixing end 341 and a connecting end 342. The fixing end 341 is connected with an end of the air pipe 31, and the connecting end 342 sleeves an external surface of the atomizing cup 36. The elastic element 35 nests an external surface of the connecting end 342. The atomizing cup 36 defines a plurality of through holes 361 in a sidewall. The connecting end 342 defines a plurality of liquid inlets 3421 matching with the through holes 361. Referring to FIG. 4 , when the mouthpiece 10 is connected with the housing 20, the mouthpiece 10 abuts against the air pipe 31, and drives the air pipe 31 and the movable element 34 to compress the elastic element 35 along an axial direction of the atomizer 100 so that each through hole 361 is in communication with a respect liquid inlet 3421. In this position, the tobacco liquid in the liquid chamber 32 flows into the atomizing chamber 362 via the liquid inlets 3421 and the through hole 361, and then the atomizing assembly 37 absorbs the tobacco liquid for atomization. When the mouthpiece 10 is detached from the housing 20, the air pipe 31 and the movable element 34 are driven by an elastic force of the elastic element 35 to restore to an initial position. In this position, the liquid inlets 3421 and the through hole 361 are in misalignment with each other, and the tobacco liquid in the liquid chamber 32 cannot flow into the atomizing chamber 362.     [0012]    Referring to FIG. 3 , in the present embodiment, a liquid storing layer 39 is arranged in the atomizing chamber 362, and is tightly attached to an inner surface of the atomizing cup 38. The liquid storing layer 39 is configured for absorbing the tobacco liquid flowed from the through holes 361. The atomizing assembly 37 then absorbs the tobacco liquid reserved in the liquid storing layer 39. The atomizing assembly 37 includes a liquid absorbing element 371 and a heating element 372. Two opposite ends of the liquid absorbing element 371 are both in contact with the liquid storing layer 39. The heating element 372 is in contact with the liquid absorbing element 371. In the present embodiment, the heating element 372 is oriented in a direction substantially perpendicular to the axial direction of the atomizer 100. The liquid storing layer 39 may be made of glass fiber or ceramic material. It is to be understood that, in other embodiments, when the liquid absorbing layer 39 is omitted, the liquid absorbing element 371 can extend into the through holes 361.     [0013]    Referring to FIG. 2 , the liquid tank 30 includes a liquid injecting opening 301 at an end adjacent to the mouthpiece 10. A valve 302 is provided in the liquid injecting opening 301, and is configured for sealing the liquid injecting opening 301. The valve 302 can be pushed open by an external liquid injector, so that tobacco liquid can be injected into the liquid chamber 32. When the injector is moved out from the liquid injecting opening 301, the valve 302 can restore to its original shape to seal the liquid injecting opening 301.     [0014]    In the present embodiment, referring to FIG. 6 , the valve 302 includes a protrusion 3021 and an elastic piece 3022. The protrusion 3021 is formed on an inner surface of the liquid tank 30. The elastic piece 3022 abuts against the protrusion 3021. The elastic piece 3022 nests the air pipe 31. The elastic piece 3022 may be made of rubber or silicone. To prevent liquid leakage after the elastic piece 3022 is moved downwards, an edge of the elastic piece 3022 may tightly abuts against an inner wall of the liquid tank 32.     [0015]    In the present embodiment, since the liquid absorbing element 371 is not in contact with the tobacco liquid in the liquid chamber 32 for a long time, the atomizing assembly 37 will absorb too much tobacco liquid, thus avoiding liquid leakage.     [0016]    It is to be noted that in an alternative embodiment, referring to FIG. 7 , the heating element 372 may be oriented in a direction parallel to the axial direction of the atomizer 100. In this case, the liquid absorbing element 371 may be in tight contact with the inner wall of the atomizing cup 36; alternatively, the liquid absorbing element 371 may be in tight contact with the liquid absorbing layer 39. The liquid absorbing element 371 may be made of glass fiber or ceramic material.     [0017]    Referring to FIG. 8 , an electronic cigarette is shown. The electronic cigarette includes the atomizer 100 and a power supply 200. The atomizer 100 and the power supply 200 are coupled by screw threads. The power supply 200 is configured for feeding the atomizer 100 power.     [0018]    It is understood that the above-described embodiments are intended to illustrate rather than limit the disclosure. Variations may be made to the embodiments and methods without departing from the spirit of the disclosure. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the scope of the disclosure.
