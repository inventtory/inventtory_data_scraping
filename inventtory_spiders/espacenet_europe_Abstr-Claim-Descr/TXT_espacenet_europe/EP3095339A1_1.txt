[0008]    Several definitions that apply throughout this disclosure will now be presented.     [0009]    The term "outside" refers to a region that is beyond the outermost confines of a physical object. The term "inside" indicates that at least a portion of a region is partially contained within a boundary formed by the object. The term "substantially" is defined to be essentially conforming to the particular dimension, shape or other word that substantially modifies, such that the component need not be exact. For example, substantially cylindrical means that the object resembles a cylinder, but can have one or more deviations from a true cylinder. The term "comprising," when utilized, means "including, but not necessarily limited to"; it specifically indicates open-ended inclusion or membership in the so-described combination, group, series and the like.     [0010]    Referring to FIGS.1-3 , an atomizing head 100 is shown. The atomizing head 100 is detachably arranged in an atomizer 200 (as seen in FIG. 7 ). The atomizing head 100 includes a main body 120, an air inlet 131, an exit pipe 110, a first connecting electrode 130 and a second connecting electrode 124. The main body 120 defines an atomizing chamber 123. The main body 120 further defines a through hole 121 so that tobacco liquid can flow into the atomizing chamber 123 via the through hole 121. A liquid conducting element 170 and a heating element 173 are arranged in the atomizing chamber 123. The liquid conducting element 170 is configured (i.e., structured and arranged) for absorbing tobacco liquid. The heating element 173 is in contact with the liquid conducting element 170. The liquid conducting element 170 defines a plurality of air passages 172 communicating the air inlet 131 and the exit pipe 110. The heating element 173 is configured for heating the tobacco liquid to form aerosol. The aerosol passes through the air passage 172, and then flows out from the exit pipe 110.     [0011]    In the present embodiment, the exit pipe 110 includes an air outlet 111, the air inlet 131 is defined in the first connecting electrode 130, and the second connecting electrode 124 and the main body 120 are integrally formed. The main body 120 includes a plurality of external screws 122, via which the atomizing head 100 is detachably engaged in the atomizer. The atomizing head 100 is further provided with a sealing ring 150 nesting the exit pipe 110.     [0012]    Referring to FIGS. 3-5 , the liquid conducting element 170 is cylindrical, and defines a plurality of air passages 172. The liquid conducting element 170 divides the atomizing chamber 123 into two areas. One area is configured for storing tobacco liquid, while the other includes a plurality of air passages 172. A first sealing element 180 and a second sealing element 190 are arranged at two opposite ends of the liquid conducting element 170, and configured for separating the two areas. The liquid conducting element 170 is made of ceramic material. The heating element 173 is arranged in the liquid conducting element 170. Two opposite ends 174, 175 of the heating element 173 are electrically connected to the first connecting electrode 130 and the second connecting electrode 124. The heating element 173 is formed in the liquid conducting element 170 by e.g., sintering. The liquid conducting element 170 absorbs tobacco liquid flowed into the atomizing chamber 123 via the through hole 121. The liquid conducting element 170 can prevent the tobacco liquid from flowing out from the air inlet 131 and air outlet 111.     [0013]    Referring to FIG. 5 , a temperature sensor 171 is arranged on a liquid conducting element 170, and configured for sensing a temperature of the liquid conducting element 170. In the present embodiment, the first sealing element 180 and the second sealing element 190 may be made of rubber or silicone.     [0014]    In the present embodiment, the liquid conducting element 170 defines a plurality of air passages 172, the air from the air inlet 131 flows through the air passage 172, and then flows out from the exit pipe 110. The tobacco liquid flowed into the atomizing chamber is only stored in one of the two areas, and will not flow out through the air passage 172. Therefore, the liquid conducting element 170 can prevent liquid leakage.     [0015]    In other embodiments, a total number of the air passages may be one or two. In an alternative embodiment, an exterior surface of the liquid conducting element 170 is in contact with an interior surface of the atomizing chamber 123.     [0016]    Referring to FIG. 6-7 , an atomizer 200 is shown. The atomizer 200 is configured for coupling with a power supply 300 to form an electronic cigarette (as seen in FIG. 8 ). The atomizer 200 includes a housing 220, a liquid chamber 240, an air pipe 230, the atomizing head 100, and a fixing holder 170. The liquid chamber 240 is adapted for storing tobacco liquid. The tobacco liquid in the liquid chamber 240 flows into the atomizing chamber 123 via the through hole 121 (also referring to FIG. 3 ). The exit pipe 110 is hermetically connected with the air pipe 230 via the sealing ring 150. The main body 120 is detachably connected with the fixing holder 270 through the external screws 122.     [0017]    Referring to FIG. 7 , the atomizer 200 further includes a first electrode 250 and a second electrode 260. After the atomizing head 100 is assembled with the fixing holder 170, the first electrode 250 and the second electrode 260 are electrically connected to the first connecting electrode 130 and the second connecting electrode 124, respectively.     [0018]    Referring to FIG. 8 , an electronic cigarette is shown. The electronic cigarette includes the above atomizer 200 of the second embodiment and a power supply 300. The atomizer 200 and the power supply 300 are coupled via screw threads. The power supply 300 is configured for supplying the atomizer 200 power.
