In the case of non-adaptive HARQ, the retransmission\n     request is sent on a physical HARQ indicator channel (PHICH) through the\n     transmission of a negative acknowledgment (NACK) signal. In the case of\n     adaptive HARQ, which is activated by transmitting an acknowledgment (ACK)\n     signal on the PHICH, according to the previous transmissions and\n     depending on the resource scheduling of other users in the system, both\n     the format and the frequency location of retransmissions are signaled by\n     the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) while overriding the PHICH.\nSUMMARY\n[0003] A method and apparatus are described for allocating resources for\n     an enhanced physical hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) channel\n     (E-PHICH). A subset of an enhanced physical downlink control channel\n     (E-PDCCH) may be allocated for use by the E-PHICH. The E-PDCCH may be\n     defined by at least one of enhanced resource element groups (eREGs) and\n     enhanced control channel elements (eCCEs). Each eCCE may be formed by\n     grouping a plurality of eREGs. Each eREG may contain at least one\n     resource element (RE). Alternatively, a subset of eREGs may be allocated\n     as E-PHICH resources. E-PDCCH physical resource block (PRB) pairs may be\n     selected as a resource for the E-PHICH. An indication of the number of\n     the eCCEs may be broadcast to a wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU).\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0004] A more detailed understanding may be had from the following\n     description, given by way of example in conjunction with the accompanying\n     drawings wherein:\n[0005] FIG. 1A shows an example communications system in which one or more\n     disclosed embodiments may be implemented;\n[0006] FIG. 1B shows an example wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU) that\n     may be used within the communications system shown in FIG. 1A;\n[0007] FIG. 1C shows an example radio access network and an example core\n     network that may be used within the communications system shown in FIG.\n     1A;\n[0008] FIG. 2 shows physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH) and\n     physical hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) indicator channel (PHICH)\n     resource element group (REG) allocation according to a physical cell\n     identifier (PCI);\n[0009] FIG. 3 shows an orthogonal sequence according to a sequence index\n     and a spreading factor;\n[0010] FIG. 4 shows HARQ indicator (HI) code words with a repetition\n     factor of 3;\n[0011] FIG. 5 shows HI code words with a repetition factor of 4;\n[0012] FIGS. 6 and 7 show evolved PHICH (E-PHICH) signal construction;\n[0013] FIGS. 8A and 8B show localized and distributed resource block\n     allocation for E-PHICH;\n[0014] FIG. 9 shows implicit resource block allocation for E-PHICH using\n     an offset with respect to the E-PDCCH;\n[0015] FIG. 10 shows E-PHICH resource mapping for two different reference\n     symbol configurations;\n[0016] FIG. 11 shows available REGs for E-PHICH transmission within a\n     single resource block (RB); and\n[0017] FIG. 12 shows an example of REG mapping with interleaving and\n     cyclic shift.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n[0018] FIG. 1A shows an example communications system 100 in which one or\n     more disclosed embodiments may be implemented.

For example, the communications systems 100 may\n     employ one or more channel access methods, such as code division multiple\n     access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division\n     multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), single-carrier FDMA\n     (SC-FDMA), and the like.\n[0019] As shown in FIG. 1A, the communications system 100 may include\n     wireless transmit/receive units (WTRUs) 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d, a radio\n     access network (RAN) 104, a core network 106, a public switched telephone\n     network (PSTN) 108, the Internet 110, and other networks 112, though it\n     will be appreciated that the disclosed embodiments contemplate any number\n     of WTRUs, base stations, networks, and/or network elements. Each of the\n     WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d may be any type of device configured to\n     operate and/or communicate in a wireless environment. By way of example,\n     the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d may be configured to transmit and/or\n     receive wireless signals and may include user equipment (UE), a mobile\n     station, a fixed or mobile subscriber unit, a pager, a cellular\n     telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a smartphone, a laptop, a\n     netbook, a personal computer, a wireless sensor, consumer electronics,\n     and the like.\n[0020] The communications systems 100 may also include a base station 114a\n     and a base station 114b. Each of the base stations 114a, 114b may be any\n     type of device configured to wirelessly interface with at least one of\n     the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d to facilitate access to one or more\n     communication networks, such as the core network 106, the Internet 110,\n     and/or the other networks 112. By way of example, the base stations 114a,\n     114b may be a base transceiver station (BTS), a Node-B, an evolved Node-B\n     (eNB), a home Node-B (HNB), a home eNB (HeNB), a site controller, an\n     access point (AP), a wireless router, and the like. While the base\n     stations 114a, 114b are each depicted as a single element, it will be\n     appreciated that the base stations 114a, 114b may include any number of\n     interconnected base stations and/or network elements.\n[0021] The base station 114a may be part of the RAN 104, which may also\n     include other base stations and/or network elements (not shown), such as\n     a base station controller (BSC), a radio network controller (RNC), relay\n     nodes, and the like. The base station 114a and/or the base station 114b\n     may be configured to transmit and/or receive wireless signals within a\n     particular geographic region, which may be referred to as a cell (not\n     shown). The cell may further be divided into cell sectors. For example,\n     the cell associated with the base station 114a may be divided into three\n     sectors. Thus, in one embodiment, the base station 114a may include three\n     transceivers, i.e., one for each sector of the cell. In another\n     embodiment, the base station 114a may employ multiple-input\n     multiple-output (MIMO) technology and, therefore, may utilize multiple\n     transceivers for each sector of the cell.\n[0022] The base stations 114a, 114b may communicate with one or more of\n     the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d over an air interface 116, which may be\n     any suitable wireless communication link, (e.g., radio frequency (RF),\n     microwave, infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), visible light, and the like).\n     The air interface 116 may be established using any suitable radio access\n     technology (RAT).\n[0023] More specifically, as noted above, the communications system 100\n     may be a multiple access system and may employ one or more channel access\n     schemes, such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA, and the like. For\n     example, the base station 114a in the RAN 104 and the WTRUs 102a, 102b,\n     102c may implement a radio technology such as universal mobile\n     telecommunications system (UMTS) terrestrial radio access (UTRA), which\n     may establish the air interface 116 using wideband CDMA (WCDMA). WCDMA\n     may include communication protocols such as high-speed packet access\n     (HSPA) and/or evolved HSPA (HSPA+). HSPA may include high-speed downlink\n     packet access (HSDPA) and/or high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA).\n[0024] In another embodiment, the base station 114a and the WTRUs 102a,\n     102b, 102c may implement a radio technology such as evolved UTRA\n     (E-UTRA), which may establish the air interface 116 using long term\n     evolution (LTE) and/or LTE-advanced (LTE-A).\n[0025] In other embodiments, the base station 114a and the WTRUs 102a,\n     102b, 102c may implement radio technologies such as IEEE 802.16 (i.e.,\n     worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX)), CDMA2000,\n     CDMA2000 1.times., CDMA2000 evolution-data optimized (EV-DO), Interim\n     Standard 2000 (IS-2000), Interim Standard 95 (IS-95), Interim Standard\n     856 (IS-856), global system for mobile communications (GSM), enhanced\n     data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE), GSM/EDGE RAN (GERAN), and the like.\n[0026] The base station 114b in FIG. 1A may be a wireless router, HNB,\n     HeNB, or AP, for example, and may utilize any suitable RAT for\n     facilitating wireless connectivity in a localized area, such as a place\n     of business, a home, a vehicle, a campus, and the like. In one\n     embodiment, the base station 114b and the WTRUs 102c, 102d may implement\n     a radio technology such as IEEE 802.11 to establish a wireless local area\n     network (WLAN). In another embodiment, the base station 114b and the\n     WTRUs 102c, 102d may implement a radio technology such as IEEE 802.15 to\n     establish a wireless personal area network (WPAN). In yet another\n     embodiment, the base station 114b and the WTRUs 102c, 102d may utilize a\n     cellular-based RAT, (e.g., WCDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, LTE, LTE-A, and the\n     like), to establish a picocell or femtocell. As shown in FIG. 1A, the\n     base station 114b may have a direct connection to the Internet 110. Thus,\n     the base station 114b may not be required to access the Internet 110 via\n     the core network 106.\n[0027] The RAN 104 may be in communication with the core network 106,\n     which may be any type of network configured to provide voice, data,\n     applications, and/or voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services to one\n     or more of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d. For example, the core\n     network 106 may provide call control, billing services, mobile\n     location-based services, pre-paid calling, Internet connectivity, video\n     distribution, and the like, and/or perform high-level security functions,\n     such as user authentication. Although not shown in FIG. 1A, it will be\n     appreciated that the RAN 104 and/or the core network 106 may be in direct\n     or indirect communication with other RANs that employ the same RAT as the\n     RAN 104 or a different RAT. For example, in addition to being connected\n     to the RAN 104, which may be utilizing an E-UTRA radio technology, the\n     core network 106 may also be in communication with another RAN (not\n     shown) employing a GSM radio technology.\n[0028] The core network 106 may also serve as a gateway for the WTRUs\n     102a, 102b, 102c, 102d to access the PSTN 108, the Internet 110, and/or\n     other networks 112. The PSTN 108 may include circuit-switched telephone\n     networks that provide plain old telephone service (POTS). The Internet\n     110 may include a global system of interconnected computer networks and\n     devices that use common communication protocols, such as the transmission\n     control protocol (TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP) and the Internet\n     protocol (IP) in the TCP/IP suite. The networks 112 may include wired or\n     wireless communications networks owned and/or operated by other service\n     providers. For example, the networks 112 may include another core network\n     connected to one or more RANs, which may employ the same RAT as the RAN\n     104 or a different RAT.\n[0029] Some or all of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d in the\n     communications system 100 may include multi-mode capabilities, i.e., the\n     WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, 102d may include multiple transceivers for\n     communicating with different wireless networks over different wireless\n     links. For example, the WTRU 102c shown in FIG. 1A may be configured to\n     communicate with the base station 114a, which may employ a cellular-based\n     radio technology, and with the base station 114b, which may employ an\n     IEEE 802 radio technology.\n[0030] FIG. 1B shows an example WTRU 102 that may be used within the\n     communications system 100 shown in FIG. 1A. As shown in FIG. 1B, the WTRU\n     102 may include a processor 118, a transceiver 120, a transmit/receive\n     element, (e.g., an antenna), 122, a speaker/microphone 124, a keypad 126,\n     a display/touchpad 128, a non-removable memory 130, a removable memory\n     132, a power source 134, a global positioning system (GPS) chipset 136,\n     and peripherals 138. It will be appreciated that the WTRU 102 may include\n     any sub-combination of the foregoing elements while remaining consistent\n     with an embodiment.\n[0031] The processor 118 may be a general purpose processor, a special\n     purpose processor, a conventional processor, a digital signal processor\n     (DSP), a microprocessor, one or more microprocessors in association with\n     a DSP core, a controller, a microcontroller, an application specific\n     integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA)\n     circuit, an integrated circuit (IC), a state machine, and the like. The\n     processor 118 may perform signal coding, data processing, power control,\n     input/output processing, and/or any other functionality that enables the\n     WTRU 102 to operate in a wireless environment. The processor 118 may be\n     coupled to the transceiver 120, which may be coupled to the\n     transmit/receive element 122. While FIG. 1B depicts the processor 118 and\n     the transceiver 120 as separate components, the processor 118 and the\n     transceiver 120 may be integrated together in an electronic package or\n     chip.\n[0032] The transmit/receive element 122 may be configured to transmit\n     signals to, or receive signals from, a base station (e.g., the base\n     station 114a) over the air interface 116. For example, in one embodiment,\n     the transmit/receive element 122 may be an antenna configured to transmit\n     and/or receive RF signals. In another embodiment, the transmit/receive\n     element 122 may be an emitter/detector configured to transmit and/or\n     receive IR, UV, or visible light signals, for example. In yet another\n     embodiment, the transmit/receive element 122 may be configured to\n     transmit and receive both RF and light signals. The transmit/receive\n     element 122 may be configured to transmit and/or receive any combination\n     of wireless signals.\n[0033] In addition, although the transmit/receive element 122 is depicted\n     in FIG. 1B as a single element, the WTRU 102 may include any number of\n     transmit/receive elements 122. More specifically, the WTRU 102 may employ\n     MIMO technology. Thus, in one embodiment, the WTRU 102 may include two or\n     more transmit/receive elements 122, (e.g., multiple antennas), for\n     transmitting and receiving wireless signals over the air interface 116.\n[0034] The transceiver 120 may be configured to modulate the signals that\n     are to be transmitted by the transmit/receive element 122 and to\n     demodulate the signals that are received by the transmit/receive element\n     122. As noted above, the WTRU 102 may have multi-mode capabilities. Thus,\n     the transceiver 120 may include multiple transceivers for enabling the\n     WTRU 102 to communicate via multiple RATs, such as UTRA and IEEE 802.11,\n     for example.\n[0035] The processor 118 of the WTRU 102 may be coupled to, and may\n     receive user input data from, the speaker/microphone 124, the keypad 126,\n     and/or the display/touchpad 128 (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD)\n     display unit or organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display unit). The\n     processor 118 may also output user data to the speaker/microphone 124,\n     the keypad 126, and/or the display/touchpad 128. In addition, the\n     processor 118 may access information from, and store data in, any type of\n     suitable memory, such as the non-removable memory 130 and/or the\n     removable memory 132. The non-removable memory 130 may include\n     random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), a hard disk, or any\n     other type of memory storage device. The removable memory 132 may include\n     a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, a memory stick, a secure digital\n     (SD) memory card, and the like. In other embodiments, the processor 118\n     may access information from, and store data in, memory that is not\n     physically located on the WTRU 102, such as on a server or a home\n     computer (not shown).\n[0036] The processor 118 may receive power from the power source 134, and\n     may be configured to distribute and/or control the power to the other\n     components in the WTRU 102. The power source 134 may be any suitable\n     device for powering the WTRU 102. For example, the power source 134 may\n     include one or more dry cell batteries (e.g., nickel-cadmium (NiCd),\n     nickel-zinc (NiZn), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), lithium-ion (Li-ion),\n     and the like), solar cells, fuel cells, and the like.\n[0037] The processor 118 may also be coupled to the GPS chipset 136, which\n     may be configured to provide location information (e.g., longitude and\n     latitude) regarding the current location of the WTRU 102. In addition to,\n     or in lieu of, the information from the GPS chipset 136, the WTRU 102 may\n     receive location information over the air interface 116 from a base\n     station, (e.g., base stations 114a, 114b), and/or determine its location\n     based on the timing of the signals being received from two or more nearby\n     base stations. The WTRU 102 may acquire location information by way of\n     any suitable location-determination method while remaining consistent\n     with an embodiment.\n[0038] The processor 118 may further be coupled to other peripherals 138,\n     which may include one or more software and/or hardware modules that\n     provide additional features, functionality and/or wired or wireless\n     connectivity. For example, the peripherals 138 may include an\n     accelerometer, an e-compass, a satellite transceiver, a digital camera\n     (for photographs or video), a universal serial bus (USB) port, a\n     vibration device, a television transceiver, a hands free headset, a\n     Bluetooth.RTM. module, a frequency modulated (FM) radio unit, a digital\n     music player, a media player, a video game player module, an Internet\n     browser, and the like.\n[0039] FIG. 1C shows an example RAN 104 and an example core network 106\n     that may be used within the communications system 100 shown in FIG. 1A.\n     As noted above, the RAN 104 may employ an E-UTRA radio technology to\n     communicate with the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c over the air interface 116.\n     The RAN 104 may also be in communication with the core network 106.\n[0040] The RAN 104 may include eNBs 140a, 140b, 140c, though it will be\n     appreciated that the RAN 104 may include any number of eNBs while\n     remaining consistent with an embodiment. The eNBs 140a, 140b, 140c may\n     each include one or more transceivers for communicating with the WTRUs\n     102a, 102b, 102c over the air interface 116. In one embodiment, the eNBs\n     140a, 140b, 140c may implement MIMO technology. Thus, the eNB 140a, for\n     example, may use multiple antennas to transmit wireless signals to, and\n     receive wireless signals from, the WTRU 102a.\n[0041] Each of the eNBs 140a, 140b, 140c may be associated with a\n     particular cell (not shown) and may be configured to handle radio\n     resource management decisions, handover decisions, scheduling of users in\n     the uplink and/or downlink, and the like. As shown in FIG. 1C, the eNBs\n     140a, 140b, 140c may communicate with one another over an X2 interface.\n[0042] The core network 106 shown in FIG. 1C may include a mobility\n     management entity (MME) 142, a serving gateway 144, and a packet data\n     network (PDN) gateway 146. While each of the foregoing elements are\n     depicted as part of the core network 106, it will be appreciated that any\n     one of these elements may be owned and/or operated by an entity other\n     than the core network operator.\n[0043] The MME 142 may be connected to each of the eNBs 140a, 140b, 140c\n     in the RAN 104 via an S1 interface and may serve as a control node. For\n     example, the MME 142 may be responsible for authenticating users of the\n     WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, bearer activation/deactivation, selecting a\n     particular serving gateway during an initial attach of the WTRUs 102a,\n     102b, 102c, and the like. The MME 142 may also provide a control plane\n     function for switching between the RAN 104 and other RANs (not shown)\n     that employ other radio technologies, such as GSM or WCDMA.\n[0044] The serving gateway 144 may be connected to each of the eNBs 140a,\n     140b, 140c in the RAN 104 via the S1 interface. The serving gateway 144\n     may generally route and forward user data packets to/from the WTRUs 102a,\n     102b, 102c. The serving gateway 144 may also perform other functions,\n     such as anchoring user planes during inter-eNB handovers, triggering\n     paging when downlink data is available for the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c,\n     managing and storing contexts of the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c, and the\n     like.\n[0045] The serving gateway 144 may also be connected to the PDN gateway\n     146, which may provide the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c with access to\n     packet-switched networks, such as the Internet 110, to facilitate\n     communications between the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c and IP-enabled devices.\n[0046] The core network 106 may facilitate communications with other\n     networks. For example, the core network 106 may provide the WTRUs 102a,\n     102b, 102c with access to circuit-switched networks, such as the PSTN\n     108, to facilitate communications between the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c and\n     traditional land-line communications devices. For example, the core\n     network 106 may include, or may communicate with, an IP gateway, (e.g.,\n     an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) server), that serves as an interface\n     between the core network 106 and the PSTN 108. In addition, the core\n     network 106 may provide the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c with access to the\n     networks 112, which may include other wired or wireless networks that are\n     owned and/or operated by other service providers.\n[0047] A PHICH may be used to transmit an ACK signal or a NACK signal\n     corresponding to a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) transmitted in\n     an uplink subframe. A PHICH may be transmitted in a distributed manner\n     across the system bandwidth and orthogonal frequency division\n     multiplexing (OFDM) symbols within a downlink control channel. The number\n     of OFDM symbols may be defined as the PHICH duration and may be\n     configurable via higher layer signaling. Unlike a physical control format\n     indicator channel (PCFICH), the PHICH resource position may vary\n     according to the PHICH duration.\n[0048] FIG. 2 shows PCFICH and PHICH resource element group (REG)\n     allocation according to a physical cell identifier (PCI), (e.g., 40\n     resource blocks (RBs)).\n[0049] As shown in FIG. 2, multiple PHICH groups are defined in a cell. A\n     PHICH group may contain multiple PHICHs with orthogonal sequences. The\n     PHICH for a WTRU may be defined dynamically with resource information in\n     an uplink grant, such as by a lowest physical resource block (PRB) index\n     (I.sub.PRB.sub.RA.sup.lowest.sup.index) and a demodulation reference\n     signal (DM-RS) cyclic shift (n.sub.DMRS), where PRB.sub.RA may denote the\n     PRBs granted for PUSCH transmission. Therefore, a two index pair (PHICH\n     group index: n.sub.PHICH.sup.group, PHICH sequence index:\n     n.sub.PHICH.sup.seq) may indicate the PHICH resource for a specific WTRU.\n     In the PHICH index pair (n.sub.PHICH.sup.group,n.sub.PHICH.sup.seq), each\n     index may be defined as follows:\n       n      group     PHICH     =   (   I       lowest index       PRB\n     RA      +  n DMRS   )    mod        N      group     PHICH      ; and\n     Equation         ( 1 )         n      seq     PHICH     =   (   [   I\n       lowest index       PRB RA       N      group     PHICH      ]  +  n\n     DMRS   )    mod        2   N       PHICH     SF    .       Equation\n       ( 2 )     ##EQU00001##\n where N.sub.PHICH.sup.group may denote the number of the PHICH group\n     available in the system with following definition:\n      N      group     PHICH     =  {         N g  (  N       DL     RB\n     8   )         2      N g     (  N       DL     RB    8   )         ,\n      Equation         ( 3 )     ##EQU00002##\n where N.sub.g is 2-bits of information transmitted via the physical\n     broadcasting channel (PBCH), and the information is within\n   N g  .di-elect cons.   {   1 6  ,  1 2  , 1 , 2  }  .  ##EQU00003##\n The orthogonal sequence according to the spreading factor is shown in\n     FIG. 3.\n[0050] Some potential enhancements of the PDCCH may be introduced in LTE,\n     such as evolved PDCCH (E-PDCCH)). Under these enhancements, the E-PDCCH\n     may start at the first symbol of the subframe, (i.e., symbol #0), which\n     may imply that there is no control region dedicated to the PDCCH and/or\n     PHICH transmission in the subframe. Moreover, there is a general trend in\n     LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) to move from a cell-specific reference signal (CRS)\n     centric design towards a wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU)-specific\n     reference signal-based transmission. This may imply that the PHICH\n     structure may not be supported in future deployments of LTE-A.\n[0051] The PHICH may support uplink data retransmissions during a\n     non-adaptive synchronous HARQ operation. To extend the functionality of a\n     synchronous uplink HARQ protocol, a new mechanism may be required as an\n     alternative to PHICH for the HARQ ACK/NACK transmission in the downlink.\n     This mode of HARQ operation may be relevant for semi-persistent\n     scheduling (SPS) where the WTRU relies on the PHICH to receive the ACKs\n     in the absence of an uplink grant.\n[0052] A new physical channel, the enhanced PHICH (E-PHICH), may be\n     configured to transmit an HARQ ACK/NACK in response to an uplink shared\n     channel (UL-SCH) transmission. A WTRU may receive ACKs on an E-PHICH\n     channel, which is transmitted on a legacy LTE physical downlink shared\n     channel (PDSCH) region.\n[0053] Repetition coding is used to realize link adaptation for the\n     E-PHICH. The repetition factor may be a predefined number. In this case,\n     the repetition factor may be different according to the system parameters\n     including cyclic prefix (CP) length, in which an extended CP may have a\n     larger repetition factor, since a larger cell range needs to be covered,\n     or duplex mode, whereby time division duplex (TDD) may have a larger\n     repetition factor than frequency division duplex (FDD).\n[0054] The repetition factor may be cell-specific and configured by a\n     broadcasting channel, (e.g., master information block (MIB), system\n     information block (SIB)). The repetition factor may depend on the channel\n     condition of the WTRU to which the E-PHICH is intended. To obtain a\n     robust E-PHICH design for the WTRUs at the cell edge, the repetition\n     factor may be increased.\n[0055] An E-PHICH may be used to transmit multiple ACK/NACK information\n     bits according to the repetition factor. For example, if repetition\n     factor 3 is used, one ACK/NACK information bit may be transmitted per\n     E-PHICH. FIG. 4 shows an example of the HARQ indicator (HI) codeword in\n     case of repetition factor 3, which is the same as the legacy PHICH, where\n     HI=1 is for a positive ACK and HI=0 is for a NACK. As another example, if\n     repetition factor 4 is used, two ACK/NACK information bits may be\n     transmitted per E-PHICH as shown in FIG. 5.\n[0056] Although two ACK/NACK information bits may be transmitted per\n     E-PHICH, one E-PHICH may be assigned for a single WTRU. Therefore, if a\n     WTRU expects only one ACK/NACK information bit, a subset of HIs may used\n     for the WTRU. For example, {HI=0 and HI=3} may be used so that the WTRU\n     assumes that the HI code word is either HI=0 or HI=3.\n[0057] One example of the overall E-PHICH signal construction scheme is\n     shown in FIG. 6. As shown in FIG. 6, at the first stage, a positive ACK\n     may encoded as a binary `1` and a NACK as a binary `0`. Next, the HARQ\n     ACK/NACK bit may be repeated followed by binary phase shift keying (BPSK)\n     or quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation, resulting in a single\n     HARQ ACK/NACK modulation symbol. The modulation symbols from multiple\n     WTRUs may be code multiplexed using orthogonal codes such as Walsh codes\n     or discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codes, (e.g., a Walsh code of length\n     4), to form an E-PHICH group. The combined signal may be scrambled with a\n     unique cell-specific (i.e., cell ID), subframe-specific, and/or resource\n     block (RB)-specific scrambling sequence to randomize the inter-cell\n     interference, followed by resource mapping and precoding operations.\n[0058] An alternative E-PHICH signal construction scheme is shown in FIG.\n     7. A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) may be attached to the entire payload\n     of ACK/NACK information bits for multiple users. Then, the bits may be\n     channel encoded with a tail-biting convolutional code or turbo code and\n     rate matched to fit the amount of resources assigned for E-PHICH\n     transmission. The sequence of bits may be scrambled by a cell-specific,\n     subframe-specific, and/or RB-specific scrambling sequence to randomize\n     inter-cell interference, followed by modulation, precoding, and mapping\n     to REs.\n[0059] The E-PHICH region may contain a number of localized or distributed\n     RBs. Using distributed RBs may exploit frequency diversity for better\n     coverage. Two non-limiting examples of resource block mapping for E-PHICH\n     are shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B.\n[0060] For resource allocation, the WTRU may determine the E-PHICH region\n     according to localized allocation or distributed allocation. For\n     localized allocation, the starting RB location and the number of RBs\n     allocated to the E-PHICH transmission in the case of localized E-PHICH\n     resource allocation may be indicated, as shown in FIG. 8A. For\n     distributed allocation, a bitmap may be signaled which indicates the RBs\n     or resource block groups (RBGs) allocated for E-PHICH transmission, as\n     shown in FIG. 8B.\n[0061] Implicitly, through the E-PDCCH configuration, the RBs that carry\n     the E-PHICH may be determined using a pre-defined offset with respect to\n     the E-PDCCH region as shown in FIG. 9. In this example, there may not be\n     a legacy PDCCH region available in the subframe. The E-PDCCH region may\n     be the E-PDCCH common search space, which may be configured in a\n     cell-specific manner via broadcasting channels, (e.g., MIB, SIB-x), or a\n     fixed location according to cell identity (cell-ID) and/or subframe\n     number.\n[0062] When shared with E-PDCCH, both the E-PHICH and the E-PDCCH may be\n     multiplexed and transmitted on the same control region which includes\n     multiple RBs. E-PHICH resources may be multiplexed on all physical\n     resource blocks (PRBs) configured for E-PDCCH resources. E-PHICH\n     resources may be multiplexed on the PRBs configured for either the\n     E-PDCCH common search space or the E-PDCCH WTRU-specific search space.\n     E-PHICH resources may be multiplexed on a subset of PRBs configured for\n     E-PDCCH resources. The subset may be predefined as the first PRB and may\n     be indicated to a WTRU via broadcasting channels, (e.g., MIB, SIB-x),\n     together with a number of E-PHICH groups.\n[0063] Alternatively, a set of N.sub.VRB.sup.E-PHICH virtual resource\n     blocks (VRBs) may be configured for potential E-PHICH transmission by\n     higher layers using resource allocation types 0, 1 or 2. For resource\n     allocation type 2, the VRB to PRB mapping may be configured by higher\n     layers. Configured VRBs may be continuously numbered\n     n.sub.VRB.sup.E-PHICH=0, 1, . . . , N.sub.VRB.sup.E-PHICH-1, such that\n     the VRB numbered with n.sub.VRB.sup.E-PHICH=0 refers to the configured\n     VRB with the smallest VRB number n.sub.VRB, and such that the VRB\n     numbered with n.sub.VRB.sup.E-PHICH=N.sub.VRB.sup.E-PHICH-1 refers to the\n     configured VRB with the largest n.sub.VRB.\n[0064] Resource blocks for the E-PHICH may be indicated in an implicit\n     manner within the resource blocks configured for the E-PDCCH resources.\n     For example, N.sub.ePDCCH PRB pairs may be allocated for the E-PDCCH in a\n     subframe and a subset of E-PDCCH PRB pairs N.sub.ePHICH may be used for\n     the E-PHICH. The subset of E-PDCCH PRB pairs for the E-PHICH resource\n     allocation may be selected.\n[0065] A predefined PRB pair among the E-PDCCH resources may be used. For\n     example, the PRB pairs having the lowest and highest index become the\n     E-PHICH resources. Higher layer signaling may be used to indicate which\n     E-PDCCH resources may be used for the E-PHICH transmission. An E-PHICH\n     specific scrambling sequence may be used for the E-PHICH resource\n     detection.\n[0066] A WTRU configured to monitor the E-PDCCH may receive the\n     configuration information for the E-PDCCH reception and determine which\n     PRB pairs are configured for E-PDCCH reception. Among the PRB pairs for\n     the E-PDCCH, the WTRU may determine the scrambling sequences of the\n     E-PDCCH PRB pairs and, on a condition that the WTRU detects PRB pairs\n     scrambled with E-PHICH specific scrambling sequences, the WTRU may assume\n     that the PRB pairs are not used for E-PDCCH transmission and be\n     considered as E-PHICH resources. The PRB pairs configured for the E-PHICH\n     may be used for the E-PHICH transmission, and not multiplexed with the\n     E-PDCCH. The PRB pairs configured for the E-PHICH may be used for both\n     the E-PHICH and the E-PDCCH transmission. A partial resource within a PBR\n     pair may be used as an E-PHICH resource.\n[0067] A subset of the E-PDCCH resources may be used for the E-PHICH. The\n     E-PDCCH resource may be defined with an enhanced resource element group\n     (eREG) and/or an enhanced control channel element (eCCE), where an eCCE\n     may be formed by grouping multiple eREGs. The eREG may contain one or\n     more resource elements (REs). Assuming that N.sub.ePDCCH PRB pairs are\n     allocated in a subframe, the E-PDCCH resources (i.e., N.sub.ePDCCH PRB\n     pairs) may be split into N.sub.eCCE eCCEs. Among the N.sub.eCCE eCCEs, a\n     subset of the eCCEs may be defined as E-PHICH resources. The E-PDCCH\n     resources may form an E-PDCCH common search space.\n[0068] The number of eCCEs used for the E-PHICH may be indicated to a WTRU\n     via broadcasting, (e.g., MIB, SIB-x), dedicated signaling, or dynamic\n     indication in each subframe. The eCCEs for the E-PHICH may be configured\n     with a predefined eCCE number. A WTRU configured to monitor the E-PDCCH\n     may consider the eCCE used for the E-PHICH as non-E-PDCCH resources, so\n     that the WTRU may assume that these resources are rate-matched for\n     E-PDCCH reception. The eCCEs for the E-PHICH may be configured via higher\n     layer signaling. The eCCEs for the E-PHICH may be indicated in each\n     subframe by explicit signaling.\n[0069] Alternatively, a subset of E-PDCCH eREGs may be defined as E-PHICH\n     resources. The E-PDCCH eREGs may be configured within a E-PDCCH common\n     search space. For example, if N.sub.eREG is defined within E-PDCCH\n     resources based on N.sub.ePDCCH PRB pairs, a subset of eREGs may be\n     defined as E-PHICH resources and the remaining eREGs are used for the\n     E-PDCCH. The number of eREGs used for the E-PHICH may be indicated to a\n     WTRU via broadcasting, dedicated signaling, or dynamic indication.\n     Alternatively, predefined eREG numbers are used for the E-PHICH and the\n     eREG numbers may be defined according to the number of PRB pairs\n     configured for the E-PDCCH.\n[0070] Alternatively, multiple E-PDCCH resource sets may be defined and\n     one or more PRB pairs may be used per E-PDCCH resource set. The E-PHICH\n     resource may be located in one of the E-PDCCH resource sets. The multiple\n     E-PDCCH resource sets may be defined such that all WTRU-specific search\n     spaces may be partially or fully located in a primary E-PDCCH resource\n     set, and a secondary E-PDCCH resource set may or may not be configured\n     for a WTRU. In this case, the E-PHICH resource may be defined within the\n     primary E-PDCCH resource set. The E-PDCCH resource set may be configured\n     as either a localized E-PDCCH or a distributed E-PDCCH, and the E-PHICH\n     resource may be defined within E-PDCCH resource set configured for\n     distributed E-PDCCH.\n[0071] The WTRU may receive an E-PHICH configuration as part of the system\n     information transmitted on the physical broadcast channel (PBCH) and/or\n     semi-statically through higher layers, (e.g., system information blocks\n     (SIBs)). The E-PHICH configuration may indicate the number of E-PHICH\n     resources or E-PHICH groups configured in the cell, the modulation and\n     coding scheme, the precoder index used for precoding of WTRU-specific\n     reference symbols and E-PHICH information, the antenna ports assigned for\n     E-PHICH transmission, (i.e., demodulation reference signal (DM-RS)\n     antenna port), the number of antenna ports transmitting the cell-specific\n     reference symbols, the boosting value for the reference symbols, (e.g.,\n     cell-specific reference symbols), or the repetition factor, (i.e., number\n     of resource element groups used for E-PHICH transmission).\n[0072] When system information is transmitted on the PBCH, the one\n     information bit which was originally designed to indicate the PHICH\n     duration, (e.g., the number of OFDM symbols used for PHICH\n     transmissions), together with the two bits assigned to indicate the\n     number of PHICH groups configured in the cell, (e.g., the number of\n     resources reserved in the control region for PHICH transmission as a\n     fraction of the downlink bandwidth), may be used to explicitly signal the\n     configuration parameters for E-PHICH transmission. In other words, the\n     WTRU may receive partial information regarding the configuration\n     parameters from physical channels (e.g., PBCH) and the rest of the\n     parameters through higher layer signaling (e.g., MAC, RRC).\n[0073] When the E-PHICH and the E-PDCCH are multiplexed and transmitted on\n     the same control region consisting of multiple RBs, and the configuration\n     information transmitted on the PBCH is not sufficient to extract the\n     exact knowledge regarding the E-PHICH resources, the WTRU may blindly\n     process the E-PDCCH under different E-PHICH configuration hypotheses. As\n     the outcome of the blind processing, whenever one of the hypotheses holds\n     true, the WTRU may be able to gain knowledge regarding the exact\n     resources used for E-PHICH transmissions.\n[0074] When the E-PHICH and the E-PDCCH are multiplexed and transmitted on\n     the same control region consisting of multiple RBs, the WTRU may\n     implicitly derive some of the configuration parameters for the E-PHICH\n     from the E-PDCCH configuration. For example, when the WTRU has been\n     assigned a specific DM-RS antenna port for E-PDCCH transmission, the WTRU\n     may assume that the same DM-RS antenna port has been used for E-PHICH\n     transmission. Similarly, whenever the WTRU has the knowledge regarding\n     the aggregation level used for E-PDCCH transmission, the WTRU may assume\n     that the repetition factor used for the E-PHICH transmission is the same\n     as the aggregation level used for the E-PDCCH. This method may obviate\n     the need for additional signaling to indicate some of the E-PHICH\n     configuration parameters.\n[0075] In one example of resource mapping for E-PHICH, each E-PHICH group\n     may be mapped to multiple E-PHICH resource element groups (pREGs) within\n     a resource block. The number of pREGs used for transmission of a single\n     E-PHICH group may depend on the repetition coding used for range\n     extension. Each pREG may include multiple REs (subcarriers) within the\n     resource block allocated for E-PHICH transmission.\n[0076] The pREG may be the same as the eREG defined for E-PDCCH\n     distributed transmission. The pREG index may be mapped onto a\n     WTRU-specific antenna port. The antenna port number may be one of antenna\n     ports p.epsilon.{107, 108, 109, 110}. The mapping rule between the pREG\n     index and a WTRU-specific antenna number may be predefined. The antenna\n     port p.epsilon.{107, 108, 109, 110} may have the same reference signal\n     patterns and/or sequence as an antenna port p.epsilon.{7, 8, 9, 10}. The\n     number of REs per pREG may be the same, irrespective of the number of\n     available REs in a PRB-pair for E-PHICH and/or E-PDCCH transmission. For\n     example, if multiple channel state information reference signals (CSI-RS)\n     and zero-power CSI-RS are configured in a subframe, the number of\n     available REs for E-PHICH and/or E-PDCCH transmission may be smaller than\n     the subframe not containing any CSI-RS assuming that the RE occupied by\n     CSI-RS, and zero-power CSI-RS may not be used for E-PHICH and/or E-PDCCH\n     transmission. If PRBs are shared for E-PHICH and E-PDCCH transmission,\n     the eREG for the E-PDCCH may be defined within the remaining REs after\n     allocating REs for the pREG in a PRB-pair. For example, if 120 REs in a\n     PRB-pair are available for E-PHICH and/or E-PDCCH transmission and 20 REs\n     are required for the E-PHICH, assuming that 5 pREGs need to be defined\n     and each pREGs contains 4 REs, 100 REs may remain for the E-PDCCH. In\n     this case, 100 REs may be divided into N eREGs, where N may be one of {8,\n     12, 16, 24, or 36}. For example, N may be a fixed number such as 16. The\n     number of REs for a pREG may be fixed (e.g., 4 REs) while the number of\n     REs for an eREG may vary according to the available number of REs for the\n     E-PDCCH in a PRB-pair (e.g., 6 REs in subframe n, and 8 REs in subframe\n     n+1).\n[0077] The number of REs per pREG may vary according the number of\n     available REs in a PRB-pair for E-PHICH and/or E-PDCCH transmission. In\n     this case, the number of REs for a pREG may be the same as that for an\n     eREG in a PRB-pair. If PRBs are shared for E-PHICH and E-PDCCH\n     transmission, a subset of the eREGs may be used for pREGs definition. For\n     example, if 120 REs in a PRB-pair are available for E-PHICH and/or\n     E-PDCCH transmission and 5 pREGs need to be defined in the PRB-pair, the\n     120 REs may be divided into N REGs and 5 REGs may be used as pREGs, the\n     rest may be used for eREGs, where N may be one of {8, 12, 16, 24, or 36}.\n     The subset of REGs may be selected in a predefined manner.\n[0078] To guarantee the performance of the E-PHICH, the REs located in\n     OFDM symbols containing WTRU-specific REs may be used for pREGs and the\n     rest of the REs may be used for E-PDCCH resources.\n[0079] In another example, the WTRU may assume that a pREG is composed of\n     four consecutively available REs in one OFDM symbol in a PRB-pair\n     configured for potential E-PHICH transmission counted in ascending order\n     of subcarriers. The WTRU may further assume that an RE is unavailable\n     with respect to mapping the E-PHICH if the RE is used for the\n     transmission of cell-specific reference signals. If the cell-specific\n     reference signals are configured to be transmitted only on antenna port\n     0, the WTRU may assume that REs for transmission of cell-specific\n     reference signals on antenna port 1 are unavailable for a pREG. If zero\n     power or non-zero power channel state information reference symbols\n     (CSI-RS) occur in any RE of an eight-port CSI-RS configuration, the WTRU\n     may assume that all eight REs corresponding to the eight-port CSI-RS\n     configuration are unavailable for a pREG.\n[0080] If the RE is used for the transmission of WTRU-specific reference\n     signals. The WTRU may assume that the REs (k,l) are used for transmission\n     of WTRU-specific reference signals on any of the antenna ports in the set\n     S, where S={7, 8, 11, 13} or S={9, 10, 12, 14}. The WTRU may assume that\n     the REs (k,l) are used for transmission of WTRU-specific reference\n     signals on any of the antenna ports in the set S, where S={7, 8, 9, 10,\n     11, 12, 13, 14}.\n[0081] Depending on the reference symbol pattern transmitted in a subframe\n     and the size of the REG, the number of REGs available within a PRB-pair\n     may vary. For example, in the case of an REG with a length of four, as\n     shown in FIG. 10, when a PRB-pair is configured to carry the\n     WTRU-specific reference symbols and the cell-specific reference symbols\n     are turned off, the maximum number of available REGs within a subframe in\n     the absence of CSI-RS is 38, as indicated in FIG. 11. Thus, for a given\n     subframe, there may be three REGs per OFDM symbol for those OFDM symbols\n     that do not carry the reference signals, while the number of REGs in\n     those OFDM symbols that carry reference signals is limited to two.\n     Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 10, when a RB is configured to carry the\n     cell-specific reference symbols, the maximum number of available REGs\n     within a subframe is slightly lower (36), due to the higher overhead of\n     the reference symbols, as indicated in FIG. 11.\n[0082] When there is a legacy PDCCH region in the subframe, the number of\n     REGs within an RB available for E-PHICH transmission may vary according\n     to the size of the PDCCH region. The number of REGs for an E-PHICH\n     transmission within a PRB-p air in the presence of a legacy PDCCH region\n     is shown in FIG. 11. The total number of available REGs within a subframe\n     may also be a function of the number of RBs allocated to E-PHICH and/or\n     E-PDCCH transmission. For the latter, the REGs can be shared for both\n     E-PHICH and E-PDCCH transmission. For example, the WTRU may extract and\n     decode the E-PHICH from a dedicated region for control transmission, and\n     then may extract and decode the E-PDCCH while skipping REGs used for\n     E-PHICH.\n[0083] As for the mapping of the code multiplexed sequence to the REGs,\n     the sequence may be interleaved to achieve diversity gain and/or\n     cyclically shifted to randomize inter-cell interference. The pattern of\n     cyclic shift of the REGs within a subframe may be a function of the cell\n     ID, the subframe-number, and/or the RB index. FIG. 12 shows an example of\n     REG mapping with interleaving and cyclic shift, whereby one E-PHICH group\n     is mapped on three REGs. The REGs carrying a single E-PHICH group may be\n     distributed across both the time and frequency domains to maximize both\n     time and frequency diversity gains.\n[0084] Although features and elements are described above in particular\n     combinations, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that each\n     feature or element may be used alone or in combination with any of the\n     other features and elements. In addition, the embodiments described\n     herein may be implemented in a computer program, software, or firmware\n     incorporated in a computer-readable medium for execution by a computer or\n     processor.

A processor in association\n     with software may be used to implement a radio frequency transceiver for\n     use in a WTRU, UE, terminal, base station, Node-B, eNB, HNB, HeNB, AP,\n     RNC, wireless router or any host computer.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

Traditionally, spectrum has been statically allocated\n     to licensed operators. Users served by the licensed operators are\n     provided small resource blocks in time and frequency. This scheme may not\n     provide high data rates in the order of 100s of Mbps or Gbps to multiple\n     users simultaneously.\n[0004] One of the basic problems of systems today is to let a number of\n     devices share a common resource, i.e., the allocated spectrum, in an\n     efficient manner so as to simultaneously meet all desired performance\n     objectives, such as fairness, low latency, high throughput, spectral\n     efficiency, reasonable overhead, high mobility, fast scheduling and\n     stability.\nSUMMARY\n[0005] A method and apparatus are described that provides flexible\n     spectrum usage by using a paired frequency division duplex (FDD) spectrum\n     to enable dynamic access in television white space (TVWS), sub-leased\n     spectrum or unlicensed spectrum, (e.g., industrial, scientific and\n     medical (ISM) bands), in a femto cell environment or the like. Elastic\n     FDD (E-FDD) enables femto cell operation in TVWS, sub-leased spectrum\n     and/or unlicensed spectrum, either simultaneously with licensed spectrum\n     or as an alternate channel to licensed spectrum. E-FDD enables dynamic\n     asymmetric bandwidth allocation for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) in FDD,\n     and enables variable duplex spacing, (i.e., using FDD with minimum duplex\n     spacing between DL and UL spectrum, or, using hybrid-FDD, (FDD in a time\n     duplexed fashion), when a spectrum gap between the UL and DL spectrum is\n     below a certain minimum threshold. Additionally, the signaling\n     enhancements to implement E-FDD are also provided.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0006] A more detailed understanding may be had from the following\n     description, given by way of example in conjunction with the accompanying\n     drawings wherein:\n[0007] FIG. 1A is a system diagram of an example communications system in\n     which one or more disclosed embodiments may be implemented:\n[0008] FIG. 1B is a system diagram of an example wireless transmit/receive\n     unit (WTRU) that may be used within the communications system illustrated\n     in FIG. 1A;\n[0009] FIG. 1C is a system diagram of an example radio access network and\n     an example core network that may be used within the communications system\n     illustrated in FIG. 1A; and\n[0010] FIG. 2 shows a plurality of wireless transmit/receive units (WTRUs)\n     within a macro cell and a femto cell;\n[0011] FIG. 3 shows an example architecture of a macro evolved Node-B\n     (eNodeB) and a home evolved Node-B (HeNB);\n[0012] FIG. 4 shows an example high-level architecture for a scenario\n     where a HeNB and a WTRU communicate over a single radio access technology\n     (RAT) using an FDD duplex scheme;\n[0013] FIG. 5 shows an example of moving uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) FDD\n     bands from high spectrum bands to lower spectrum bands;\n[0014] FIG. 6 shows an example licensed spectrum allocation for UL and DL\n     in FDD;\n[0015] FIG. 7 shows an example asymmetric assignment of UL and DL spectrum\n     using elastic FDD (E-FDD);\n[0016] FIGS. 8A, 8B and SC show an example dynamic allocation for UL and\n     DL spectrum based on a traffic pattern;\n[0017] FIG. 9 shows an example dynamic allocation of spectrum in\n     television whitespace (TVWS) in the presence of a wireless microphone;\n[0018] FIG. 10 shows an example of moving only the UL spectrum from a\n     licensed band to a TVWS band;\n[0019] FIG. 11 shows an example of aggregating licensed FDD UL and DL\n     spectrum with a flexible FDD in unlicensed bands.\n[0020] FIG. 12 shows an example full duplex FDD with a DL spectrum band\n     and a UL spectrum band sufficiently separated;\n[0021] FIG. 13 shows an example full duplex FDD where a DL spectrum band\n     and a UL spectrum band have minimum frequency separation;\n[0022] FIG. 14 shows an example half duplex FDD where a DL spectrum band\n     and a UL spectrum band have less than a minimum frequency separation;\n[0023] FIG. 15 shows an example full duplex FDD with adaptive interference\n     cancellation;\n[0024] FIG. 16 shows an example high level modem design to support\n     variable duplex FDD;\n[0025] FIG. 17 shows an example flowchart for elastic asymmetric bandwidth\n     provisioning (E-ABP) in elastic FDD (E-FDD);\n[0026] FIGS. 18A and 18B show an example table that indicates parameters\n     that need to be signaling during system acquisition in current femto\n     systems to enable E-FDD;\n[0027] FIGS. 19A and 19B show an example flowchart 1900 for dynamic\n     spectrum allocation for E-FDD;\n[0028] FIG. 20 shows an example call flow to enable elastic-asymmetric\n     bandwidth provisioning (E-ABP) within a cellular network; and\n[0029] FIGS. 21A, 21B and 21C show an example table comparing traditional\n     FDD and time division duplex with E-FDD.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n[0030] FIG. 1A is a diagram of an example communications system 100 in\n     which one or more disclosed embodiments may be implemented. The\n     communications system 100 may be a multiple access system that provides\n     content, such as voice, data, video, messaging, broadcast, etc., to\n     multiple wireless users. The communications system 100 may enable\n     multiple wireless users to access such content through the sharing of\n     system resources, including wireless bandwidth. For example, the\n     communications system 100 may employ one or more channel access methods,\n     such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple\n     access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA\n     (OFDMA), single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), and the like.\n[0031] As shown in FIG. 1A, the communications system 100 may include\n     wireless transmit/receive units (WTRUs) 102A, 102B, 102C, 102D, a radio\n     access network (RAN) 104, a core network 106, a public switched telephone\n     network (PSTN) 108, the Internet 110, and other networks 112, though it\n     will be appreciated that the disclosed embodiments contemplate any number\n     of WTRUs, base stations, networks, and/or network elements. Each of the\n     WTRUs 102A, 102B, 102C. 102D may be any type of device configured to\n     operate and/or communicate in a wireless environment. By way of example,\n     the WTRUs 102A, 102B, 102C, 102D may be configured to transmit and/or\n     receive wireless signals and may include user equipment (UE), a mobile\n     station, a fixed or mobile subscriber unit, a pager, a cellular\n     telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a smartphone, a laptop, a\n     netbook, a personal computer, a wireless sensor, consumer electronics,\n     and the like.\n[0032] The communications system 100 may also include a base station 114A\n     and a base station 114B. Each of the base stations 114A, 114B may be any\n     type of device configured to wirelessly interface with at least one of\n     the WTRUs 102A, 102B, 102C, 102D to facilitate access to one or more\n     communication networks, such as the core network 106, the Internet 110,\n     and/or the networks 112. By way of example, the base stations 114A, 114B\n     may be a base transceiver station (BTS), a Node-B, an eNodeB, a Home\n     Node-B, a Home eNodeB, a site controller, an access point (AP), a\n     wireless router, and the like. While the base stations 114A, 114B are\n     each depicted as a single element, it will be appreciated that the base\n     stations 114A. 114B may include any number of interconnected base\n     stations and/or network elements.\n[0033] The base station 114A may be part of the RAN 104, which may also\n     include other base stations and/or network elements (not shown), such as\n     a base station controller (BSC), a radio network controller (RNC), relay\n     nodes, etc. The base station 114A and/or the base station 114B may be\n     configured to transmit and/or receive wireless signals within a\n     particular geographic region, which may be referred to as a cell (not\n     shown). The cell may further be divided into cell sectors. For example,\n     the cell associated with the base station 114A may be divided into three\n     sectors. Thus, in one embodiment, the base station 114A may include three\n     transceivers, i.e., one for each sector of the cell. In another\n     embodiment, the base station 114A may employ multiple-input multiple\n     output (MIMO) technology and, therefore, may utilize multiple\n     transceivers for each sector of the cell.\n[0034] The base stations 114A, 114B may communicate with one or more of\n     the WTRUs 102A, 102B, 102C, 102D over an air interface 116, which may be\n     any suitable wireless communication link (e.g., radio frequency (RF),\n     microwave, infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), visible light, etc.). The air\n     interface 116 may be established using any suitable radio access\n     technology (RAT).\n[0035] More specifically, as noted above, the communications system 100\n     may be a multiple access system and may employ one or more channel access\n     schemes, such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA, and the like. For\n     example, the base station 114A in the RAN 104 and the WTRUs 102A. 102B,\n     102C may implement a radio technology such as Universal Mobile\n     Telecommunications System (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), which\n     may establish the air interface 116 using wideband CDMA (WCDMA). WCDMA\n     may include communication protocols such as High-Speed Packet Access\n     (HSPA) and/or Evolved HSPA (HSPA+). HSPA may include High-Speed DL Packet\n     Access (HSDPA) and/or High-Speed UL Packet Access (HSUPA).\n[0036] In another embodiment, the base station 114A and the WTRUs 102A,\n     102B, 102C may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UMTS\n     Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA), which may establish the air interface\n     116 using Long Term Evolution (LTE) and/or LTE-Advanced (LTE-A).\n[0037] In other embodiments, the base station 114A and the WTRUs 102A,\n     102B, 102C may implement radio technologies such as IEEE 802.16 (i.e.,\n     Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)), CDMA2000.\n     CDMA2000 1.times., CDMA2000 EV-DO, Interim Standard 2000 (IS-2000),\n     Interim Standard 95 (IS-95), Interim Standard 856 (IS-856). Global System\n     for Mobile communications (GSM), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution\n     (EDGE), GSM EDGE (GERAN), and the like.\n[0038] The base station 114B in FIG. 1A may be a wireless router, Home\n     Node-B, Home eNodeB, or access point, for example, and may utilize any\n     suitable RAT for facilitating wireless connectivity in a localized area,\n     such as a place of business, a home, a vehicle, a campus, and the like.\n     In one embodiment, the base station 114B and the WTRUs 102C, 102D may\n     implement a radio technology such as IEEE 802.11 to establish a wireless\n     local area network (WLAN). In another embodiment, the base station 114B\n     and the WTRUs 102C, 102D may implement a radio technology such as IEEE\n     802.15 to establish a wireless personal area network (WPAN). In yet\n     another embodiment, the base station 114B and the WTRUs 102C, 102D may\n     utilize a cellular-based RAT (e.g., WCDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, LTE, LTE-A,\n     etc.) to establish a picocell or femto cell. As shown in FIG. 1A, the\n     base station 114B may have a direct connection to the Internet 110. Thus,\n     the base station 114B may not be required to access the Internet 110 via\n     the core network 106.\n[0039] The RAN 104 may be in communication with the core network 106,\n     which may be any type of network configured to provide voice, data,\n     applications, and/or voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services to one\n     or more of the WTRUs 102A, 102B, 102C, 102D. For example, the core\n     network 106 may provide call control, billing services, mobile\n     location-based services, pre-paid calling, Internet connectivity, video\n     distribution, etc., and/or perform high-level security functions, such as\n     user authentication. Although not shown in FIG. 1A, it will be\n     appreciated that the RAN 104 and/or the core network 106 may be in direct\n     or indirect communication with other RANs that employ the same RAT as the\n     RAN 104 or a different RAT. For example, in addition to being connected\n     to the RAN 104, which may be utilizing an E-UTRA radio technology, the\n     core network 106 may also be in communication with another RAN (not\n     shown) employing a GSM radio technology.\n[0040] The core network 106 may also serve as a gateway for the WTRUs\n     102A, 102B, 102C, 102D to access the PSTN 108, the Internet 110, and/or\n     other networks 112. The PSTN 108 may include circuit-switched telephone\n     networks that provide plain old telephone service (POTS). The Internet\n     110 may include a global system of interconnected computer networks and\n     devices that use common communication protocols, such as the transmission\n     control protocol (TCP), user datagram protocol (UDP) and the internet\n     protocol (IP) in the TCP/IP internet protocol suite. The networks 112 may\n     include wired or wireless communications networks owned and/or operated\n     by other service providers. For example, the networks 112 may include\n     another core network connected to one or more RANs, which may employ the\n     same RAT as the RAN 104 or a different RAT.\n[0041] Some or all of the WTRUs 102A, 102B, 102C, 102D in the\n     communications system 100 may include multi-mode capabilities, i.e., the\n     WTRUs 102A, 102B, 102C, 102D may include multiple transceivers for\n     communicating with different wireless networks over different wireless\n     links. For example, the WTRU 102C shown in FIG. 1A may be configured to\n     communicate with the base station 114A, which may employ a cellular-based\n     radio technology, and with the base station 114B, which may employ an\n     IEEE 802 radio technology.\n[0042] FIG. 1B is a system diagram of an example WTRU 102. As shown in\n     FIG. 1B, the WTRU 102 may include a processor 118, a transceiver 120, a\n     transmit/receive element 122, a speaker/microphone 124, a keypad 126, a\n     display/touchpad 128, a non-removable memory 130, a removable memory 132,\n     a power source 134, a global positioning system (GPS) chipset 136, and\n     other peripherals 138. It will be appreciated that the WTRU 102 may\n     include any sub-combination of the foregoing elements while remaining\n     consistent with an embodiment.\n[0043] The processor 118 may be a general purpose processor, a special\n     purpose processor, a conventional processor, a digital signal processor\n     (DSP), a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in\n     association with a DSP core, a controller, a microcontroller, Application\n     Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Array\n     (FPGAs) circuits, any other type of integrated circuit (IC), a state\n     machine, and the like. The processor 118 may perform signal coding, data\n     processing, power control, input/output processing, and/or any other\n     functionality that enables the WTRU 102 to operate in a wireless\n     environment. The processor 118 may be coupled to the transceiver 120,\n     which may be coupled to the transmit/receive element 122. While FIG. 1B\n     depicts the processor 118 and the transceiver 120 as separate components,\n     it will be appreciated that the processor 118 and the transceiver 120 may\n     be integrated together in an electronic package or chip.\n[0044] The transmit/receive element 122 may be configured to transmit\n     signals to, or receive signals from, a base station (e.g., the base\n     station 114A) over the air interface 116. For example, in one embodiment,\n     the transmit/receive element 122 may be an antenna configured to transmit\n     and/or receive RF signals. In another embodiment, the transmit/receive\n     element 122 may be an emitter/detector configured to transmit and/or\n     receive IR, UV, or visible light signals, for example. In yet another\n     embodiment, the transmit/receive element 122 may be configured to\n     transmit and receive both RF and light signals. It will be appreciated\n     that the transmit/receive element 122 may be configured to transmit\n     and/or receive any combination of wireless signals.\n[0045] In addition, although the transmit/receive element 122 is depicted\n     in FIG. 1B as a single element, the WTRU 102 may include any number of\n     transmit/receive elements 122. More specifically, the WTRU 102 may employ\n     MIMO technology. Thus, in one embodiment, the WTRU 102 may include two or\n     more transmit/receive elements 122 (e.g., multiple antennas) for\n     transmitting and receiving wireless signals over the air interface 116.\n[0046] The transceiver 120 may be configured to modulate the signals that\n     are to be transmitted by the transmit/receive element 122 and to\n     demodulate the signals that are received by the transmit/receive element\n     122. As noted above, the WTRU 102 may have multi-mode capabilities. Thus,\n     the transceiver 120 may include multiple transceivers for enabling the\n     WTRU 102 to communicate via multiple RATs, such as UTRA and IEEE 802.11,\n     for example.\n[0047] The processor 118 of the WTRU 102 may be coupled to, and may\n     receive user input data from, the speaker/microphone 124, the keypad 126,\n     and/or the display/touchpad 128 (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD)\n     display unit or organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display unit). The\n     processor 118 may also output user data to the speaker/microphone 124,\n     the keypad 126, and/or the display/touchpad 128. In addition, the\n     processor 118 may access information from, and store data in, any type of\n     suitable memory, such as the non-removable memory 130 and/or the\n     removable memory 132. The non-removable memory 130 may include\n     random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), a hard disk, or any\n     other type of memory storage device. The removable memory 132 may include\n     a subscriber identity (ID) module (SIM) card, a memory stick, a secure\n     digital (SD) memory card, and the like. In other embodiments, the\n     processor 118 may access information from, and store data in, memory that\n     is not physically located on the WTRU 102, such as on a server or a home\n     computer (not shown).\n[0048] The processor 118 may receive power from the power source 134, and\n     may be configured to distribute and/or control the power to the other\n     components in the WTRU 102. The power source 134 may be any suitable\n     device for powering the WTRU 102. For example, the power source 134 may\n     include one or more dry cell batteries (e.g., nickel-cadmium (NiCd),\n     nickel-zinc (NiZn), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), lithium-ion (Li-ion),\n     etc.), solar cells, fuel cells, and the like.\n[0049] The processor 118 may also be coupled to the GPS chipset 136, which\n     may be configured to provide location information (e.g., longitude and\n     latitude) regarding the current location of the WTRU 102. In addition to,\n     or in lieu of, the information from the GPS chipset 136, the WTRU 102 may\n     receive location information over the air interface 116 from a base\n     station (e.g., base stations 114A, 114B) and/or determine its location\n     based on the timing of the signals being received from two or more nearby\n     base stations. It will be appreciated that the WTRU 102 may acquire\n     location information by way of any suitable location-determination method\n     while remaining consistent with an embodiment.\n[0050] The processor 118 may further be coupled to other peripherals 138,\n     which may include one or more software and/or hardware modules that\n     provide additional features, functionality and/or wired or wireless\n     connectivity. For example, the peripherals 138 may include an\n     accelerometer, an e-compass, a satellite transceiver, a digital camera\n     (for photographs or video), a universal serial bus (USB) port, a\n     vibration device, a television transceiver, a hands free headset, a\n     Bluetooth@ module, a frequency modulated (FM) radio unit, a digital music\n     player, a media player, a video game player module, an Internet browser,\n     and the like.\n[0051] FIG. 1C is a system diagram of the RAN 104 and the core network 106\n     according to an embodiment. As noted above, the RAN 104 may employ a UTRA\n     radio technology to communicate with the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c over the\n     air interface 116. The RAN 104 may also be in communication with the core\n     network 106. As shown in FIG. 1C, the RAN 104 may include Node-Bs 140a,\n     140b, 140c, which may each include one or more transceivers for\n     communicating with the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c over the air interface 116.\n     The Node-Bs 140a, 140b, 140c may each be associated with a particular\n     cell (not shown) within the RAN 104. The RAN 104 may also include RNCs\n     142a, 142b. It will be appreciated that the RAN 104 may include any\n     number of Node-Bs and RNCs while remaining consistent with an embodiment.\n[0052] As shown in FIG. 1C, the Node-Bs 140a, 140b may be in communication\n     with the RNC 142a. Additionally, the Node-B 140c may be in communication\n     with the RNC142b. The Node-Bs 140a, 140b, 140c may communicate with the\n     respective RNCs 142a, 142b via an Iub interface. The RNCs 142a, 142b may\n     be in communication with one another via an Iur interface. Each of the\n     RNCs 142a, 142b may be configured to control the respective Node-Bs 140a,\n     140b, 140c to which it is connected. In addition, each of the RNCs 142a.\n     142b may be configured to carry out or support other functionality, such\n     as outer loop power control, load control, admission control, packet\n     scheduling, handover control, macrodiversity, security functions, data\n     encryption, and the like.\n[0053] The core network 106 shown in FIG. 1C may include a media gateway\n     (MGW) 144, a mobile switching center (MSC) 146, a serving GPRS support\n     node (SGSN) 148, and/or a gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) 160. While\n     each of the foregoing elements are depicted as part of the core network\n     106, it will be appreciated that any one of these elements may be owned\n     and/or operated by an entity other than the core network operator.\n[0054] The RNC 142a in the RAN 104 may be connected to the MSC 146 in the\n     core network 106 via an IuCS interface. The MSC 146 may be connected to\n     the MGW 144. The MSC 146 and the MGW 144 may provide the WTRUs 102a,\n     102b, 102c with access to circuit-switched networks, such as the PSTN\n     108, to facilitate communications between the WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c and\n     traditional land-line communications devices.\n[0055] The RNC 142a in the RAN 104 may also be connected to the SGSN 148\n     in the core network 106 via an IuPS interface. The SGSN 148 may be\n     connected to the GGSN 150. The SGSN 148 and the GGSN 150 may provide the\n     WTRUs 102a, 102b, 102c with access to packet-switched networks, such as\n     the Internet 110, to facilitate communications between and the WTRUs\n     102a, 102b, 102c and IP-enabled devices.\n[0056] As noted above, the core network 106 may also be connected to the\n     networks 112, which may include other wired or wireless networks that are\n     owned and/or operated by other service providers.\n[0057] Spectrum pooling or aggregation across different contiguous or\n     non-contiguous bands using a single carrier or multiple carriers may be\n     needed for efficient use of spectrum resources. Each user may be\n     allocated different time and frequency resource blocks on various bands\n     across various carriers, and provide the necessary bandwidth to achieve\n     the required quality of service (QoS) by each user. The various bands\n     across different carriers may be licensed bands, unlicensed bands,\n     sub-leased bands, or whitespace bands.\n[0058] To achieve this kind of on-demand resource allocation across a wide\n     spectrum range inclusive of licensed, unlicensed, sub-leased or\n     whitespace spectrum, there is a need to provide knowledge of the Federal\n     Communications Commission (FCC) static spectrum allocation pattern and\n     instantaneous spectrum occupancy patterns of unlicensed bands, as well as\n     recently opened licensed television (TV) bands to the user\'s\n     handset/modem and the access point/gateways. Using this knowledge, the\n     system may then make instantaneous decisions to access a particular band\n     outside of the licensed cellular spectrum for active communication.\n[0059] Uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) spectra allocation in a traditional\n     frequency division duplex (FDD) licensed cellular spectrum is symmetrical\n     and static. However, spectrum usage in the UL and DL is generally\n     asymmetric due to constantly changing usage patterns/traffic demands,\n     (i.e., FDD), and may have a lightly loaded spectrum in one direction,\n     (e.g., UL), while a bottleneck in the other (e.g., DL). For example, this\n     may occur in a femto cell environment where many users/devices access the\n     same spectrum simultaneously and may have high bandwidth requirements.\n     Thus, a fixed/static FDD spectrum allocation is spectrally inefficient\n     and could give rise to bandwidth bottlenecks.\n[0060] Interference problems may also be encountered between macro cell\n     and femto cell environments due to the fact that they both operate on the\n     same spectrum band. There may be two possible ways of overcoming loss in\n     overall throughput/performance due the interference. One way is to enable\n     aggregation of bandwidth between licensed spectrum bands and other\n     spectrums like TV bands or unlicensed bands. The other way is to hop from\n     the licensed band to another band like TV bands, sub-leased bands or\n     unlicensed bands, such as industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands.\n[0061] Furthermore, if the cellular operators decide to allow operation in\n     TV white space (TVWS) spectrum in femto cells, there would be a need to\n     dynamically sense which bands are vacant and also to detect the presence\n     of wireless microphones and readjust the spectrum usage in such a way\n     that network operation over the spectrum can still continue by notching\n     out the piece of spectrum being used by the primary incumbents, such as\n     wireless microphones. For a femto cell environment, multiple simultaneous\n     users may cause bandwidth bottlenecks, asymmetric traffic patterns, and\n     varying QoS demands in the UL and DL.\n[0062] Described herein is a method and apparatus for providing an elastic\n     frequency division duplex (E-FDD) scheme with corresponding signaling\n     enhancements and associated call flows that provide flexible spectrum\n     usage by using a paired FDD) spectrum to enable dynamic access in\n     television white space (TVWS), sub-leased spectrum or unlicensed\n     spectrum, (e.g., industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands), in a\n     femto cell environment or the like.\n[0063] FIG. 2 shows an example coverage scenario 200 where a base station\n     205 provides macro cell 210 and a home evolved Node-B (HeNB), for\n     example, provides a femto cell 220. A plurality of WTRUs 225 may operate\n     within the macro cell 210 and the femto cell 220 and another plurality of\n     WTRUs 230 may operate within the macro cell 210. In a scenario where the\n     operator in the macro cell 210 uses paired FDD spectrum, the WTRUs 230\n     may move out of the macro cell 210 and into the femto cell 220 where the\n     density of WTRUs 225 may be high, as in the case of hot spots. Also, the\n     bandwidth requirement for data usage by the WTRUs 226 may be high, in\n     addition to the fact that there may be more than one WTRU 225 in the\n     femto cell 216 with high bandwidth (BW)/QoS requirements. The licensed\n     spectrum over which the femto cell 225 may be operating may quickly run\n     out of resources to support multiple high bandwidth links. Therefore,\n     femto cells may need to operate in bands outside of licensed cellular\n     spectrum like TVWS bands, ISM bands, and the like. This would permit the\n     other spectrum to be used simultaneously with the licensed spectrum in\n     bandwidth aggregation schemes or the other spectrum may be used as an\n     alternate spectrum to jump over to when macro-femto interference is high.\n[0064] FIG. 3 shows an example overall architecture 300 of an evolved\n     Node-B (eNodeB) 305 connected to or in communication with a core network\n     310 and a home evolved Node-B (H(e)NB) 315 connected to or in\n     communication with the core network 310 via an H(e)NB gateway 320. A WTRU\n     325 may be connected to or in communication with the eNodeB 305 and/or\n     the H(e)NB 315. The above architecture 300 is one example of an\n     architecture that may be used in conjunction with E-FDD as described\n     herein.\n[0065] FIG. 4 shows an example system 400 of an H(e)NB 405 and a WTRU 410\n     communicating with each other over a single radio access technology (RAT)\n     using an E-FDD duplex scheme. In general, the H(e)NB 405 may have a\n     protocol stack 420 including an Internet Protocol entity 422, a radio\n     resource controller (RRC) 424, a medium access controller 426, and a\n     physical entity 428. The protocol stack 420 may operate with a wideband\n     digital transceiver 430 that may have the capability to handle variable\n     duplex spacing, and transmit over multiple spectrum bands simultaneously\n     using a single RAT. The multiple bands, which may be licensed cellular\n     spectrum along with vacant TV bands, sub-leased bands and/or other\n     unlicensed bands, may be pooled together to provide wide bandwidth for\n     communication. The spectrum fragments from TV bands, sub-leased bands and\n     unlicensed bands are known to be vacant or occupied by accessing a white\n     space database, or may be inferred from a sensing algorithm used to\n     actively sense spectrum occupancy patterns. This may be accomplished\n     using a sensing entity 440. A cognitive policy engine 445 may provide\n     information of the spectrum availability based on information received\n     from the white space database. The WTRU 410 may have a similar\n     arrangement. For example, a protocol stack 450 may include an Internet\n     Protocol entity 452, a radio resource controller 464, a medium access\n     controller 456, and a physical entity 458. The protocol stack 450 may\n     operate with a wideband digital transceiver 460, a sensing entity 470 and\n     a cognitive policy engine 480 as described herein.\n[0066] FIG. 5 shows an example protocol stack 500 in the H(e)NB and/or the\n     WTRU that may access a wide range of spectrum bands. The protocol stack\n     500 may include a radio resource controller 505, a medium access\n     controller 510, a physical entity 515 and a wideband digital transceiver\n     620. The wideband digital transceiver 520 may be implemented as described\n     in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2010/0226330, filed Mar. 3, 2010, the\n     contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The initial\n     spectrum used by the system may be the licensed FDD paired spectrum used\n     by the network operator. The wideband digital transceiver 520 may be\n     tuned to that spectrum and the devices, the H(e)NB and WTRU, may\n     establish a RCC connection over that spectrum for uninterrupted data\n     transfer. Functionally and/or operationally, an UL FDD band 530 and DL\n     FDD band 535 may be moved from high spectrum bands to lower spectrum\n     bands, such as UL FDD band 540 and DL FDD band 545, using a digital\n     transceiver 515 in a WTRU. When the WTRU decides to hop to the new\n     spectrum, a new RRC connection may be established over the new spectrum\n     bands, and the old RRC connection is torn down. The wideband digital\n     transceiver 520 may then be re-tuned to the new spectrum bands. As\n     described herein, the UL and the DL bands of the FDD spectrum may or may\n     not have sufficient duplex spacing for full duplex transmission at the\n     new spectrum location.\n[0067] FIG. 6 shows a licensed spectrum allocation for UL spectrum 605 and\n     DL spectrum 610 in FDD. As stated herein above, in the FDD mode of\n     communication, the frequency spectrum bands have been fixed and\n     statically allocated to DL and UL. However, the bandwidth requirement on\n     the UL (DL) may be less than that of the DL (UL). Static allocation of\n     spectrum for a duplex mode of communication may be wasteful of bandwidth.\n     In E-FDD, the bandwidth and the exact spectrum bands and/or subcarriers\n     may be dynamically allocated to the UL and the DL. The spectrum is not\n     statically assigned to the uplink or downlink. Instead a block of vacant\n     spectrum may be freely distributed between the two directions, (i.e., UL\n     and DL), based on instantaneous traffic patterns and bandwidth\n     requirements.\n[0068] In addition, the spacing between the UL and the DL spectrum may be\n     variable. In FDD, the spacing between UL and DL spectrum may be very\n     large, (in the order of 10s of MHz), to relax the requirement on a radio\n     frequency (RF) duplexer design. This helps in creating adequate amount of\n     isolation between transmit and receive chains in the modem. In E-FDD, the\n     UL and DL may communicate simultaneously, such as in traditional FDD, if\n     the spacing between the UL and DL spectrum is greater than a threshold.\n     However, when the spacing is less than the threshold, a hybrid FDD scheme\n     may be used in order to prevent leakage of a transmit chain signal into\n     the receive chain.\n[0069] In FDD, the UL spectrum may not be as heavily utilized as the DL\n     spectrum. At a minimum, the UL spectrum 705 and DL spectrum 710 and 715\n     in E-FDD may be asymmetrically distributed in the licensed spectrum based\n     on traffic patterns as shown, for example, in FIG. 7. In other words, the\n     UL spectrum, (as shown as UL spectrum 605 in FIG. 6), may be split such\n     that a part of the spectrum may be utilized for UL communication, (i.e.,\n     UL spectrum 705), while the remaining part of the spectrum, (i.e., shown\n     as DL spectrum 710), may be aggregated with the licensed DL spectrum,\n     (i.e., shown as DL spectrum 715), to enhance the capacity in the DL\n     direction. This may require a low-latency and high accurate signaling of\n     the instantaneous spectral allocations in either direction between the\n     two wireless nodes communicating with each other. Based on the ability of\n     E-FDD to aggregate or split spectrum based on usage, leasing of unused\n     spectrum to third parties may be possible.\n[0070] Described herein is spectrum agility for E-FDD. FIGS. 8A-8C show an\n     example dynamic allocation for UL and DL spectrum based on a traffic\n     pattern. In general, a block of spectrum may be utilized for\n     communications in a femto cell. The spectrum may be dynamically assigned\n     by the H(e)NB between the UL and DL based on the instantaneous traffic\n     needs and the uplink spectrum and the downlink spectrum allocations may\n     not be of equal bandwidth. For example, in FIG. 8A, UL spectrum 805\n     occupies less bandwidth than DL spectrum 810, but in FIG. 8C, the UL\n     spectrum 825 occupies more bandwidth than DL spectrum 830. FIG. 8B is an\n     example of UL spectrum 816 and DL spectrum 820 occupying equal\n     bandwidths.\n[0071] FIG. 9 shows an example of dynamic allocation of spectrum in TVWS\n     in the presence of a wireless microphone. In existing cellular systems,\n     to operate in TVWS in either time division duplex (TDD) or FDD mode,\n     communication may need to be completely shut off when a primary user such\n     as a wireless microphone is detected. When the H(e)NB operates in TVWS,\n     it has to be aware of the existence of the licensed primary users of the\n     band, such as wireless microphones, and provide uninterrupted access to\n     the spectrum. In this sense, awareness may be achieved using sensing or a\n     centralized database indicating an occupancy pattern of the spectrum. The\n     spectrum usage pattern using E-FDD mode may look like the spectrum shown\n     in FIG. 9 when a wireless microphone is switched on in a particular piece\n     of the spectrum. For example, the spectrum allocation may include an UL\n     spectrum 905, a DL spectrum comprised of DL spectrum 910 and 915 and a\n     primary user spectrum 920 that may be a wireless microphone or digital\n     television (DTV) user. If not for the primary user, the DL spectrum may\n     include DL spectrum 910, DL spectrum 915 and primary user spectrum 920.\n     In E-FDD mode, communication between the H(e)NB and the WTRUs may\n     continue regardless of the presence of the primary user, (i.e., the\n     wireless microphone), and at the same time avoiding interference with the\n     primary user transmission such as a wireless microphone transmission.\n[0072] Adjacent channel interference between UL and DL spectrum due to\n     small spectrum gap may be mitigated by either using echo-cancellation\n     techniques in FDD mode or by using a hybrid FDD (H-FDD) scheme, where FDD\n     is operated in a time duplexed manner. The H-FDD scheme is favorable to\n     the indoor/home environment where transmit powers are less and thus\n     leakage between transmit and receive chains in the modem may be less.\n     Signaling enhancements may be added to signal the traditional FDD mode or\n     H-FDD mode of operation in the femto cell. Hybrid FDD or half-duplex FDD\n     scheme is a scheme wherein communication on the UL and DL spectrum is in\n     a time multiplexed fashion. The UL and DL spectrum may be non-overlapping\n     and spectrally close to each other, or may be partially overlapping or\n     fully overlapping.\n[0073] Alternatively, one band of the licensed paired spectrum, either the\n     UL spectrum or DL spectrum, may be moved to TVWS based on interference\n     issues and/or additional bandwidth requirements. The amount of TVWS\n     required to be used may vary based on QoS requirements, WTRU capability\n     and spectrum availability. For example, FIG. 10 shows an example of\n     moving an UL spectrum 1010 from a licensed band to a TVWS band 1005 and\n     maintaining a DL spectrum 1015 as is.\n[0074] FIG. 11 shows an example of aggregating licensed FDD UL and DL\n     spectrum with a flexible FDD in TVWS, sub-leased bands or unlicensed\n     bands. In general, a licensed spectrum allocated for FDD may be\n     aggregated with a fragment of unutilized and unlicensed spectrum bands\n     such that a part of the unlicensed spectrum is allocated for uplink and\n     aggregated with licensed uplink spectrum while the remaining part of the\n     unlicensed spectrum is allocated for downlink and aggregated with the\n     licensed downlink spectrum. In particular, a DL licensed spectrum 1105 is\n     carrier aggregated with a DL unlicensed band spectrum 1115 and an UL\n     licensed spectrum 1110 is carrier aggregated with an UL unlicensed band\n     spectrum 1120.\n[0075] As shown by the examples above, E-FDD provides elastic asymmetric\n     bandwidth provisioning (E-ABP) which adds to the FDD mode,\n     variable/asymmetric bandwidth for UL and DL as described herein above and\n     variable duplex spacing between UL and DL as described herein below. In\n     the latter, when spacing is less than a threshold, a communications mode\n     may switch from FDD to H-FDD.\n[0076] Described herein is dynamic swapping of UL and DL bands in E-FDD.\n     As the transmitter and the receiver may look at the same wide band, both\n     UL and DL spectra may be allocated within the same wide band without need\n     for different radios for each spectrum. This may provide certain\n     advantages.\n[0077] First, in the presence of a strong out-of-band interferer close to\n     a receiver, the spectral leakage observed in-band may limit the\n     usefulness of a spectrum fragment spectrally close to the interferer\'s\n     band. However, the out-of-band leakage observed may be an issue only if\n     the band which is experiencing the leakage is assigned for the WTRU\'s or\n     H(e)NB\'s reception. If the band allocation for the UL and DL may be\n     performed intelligently so that the band experiencing the leakage is\n     assigned to the appropriate link (UL or DL) in FDD, the performance\n     impact due to out-of-band leakage may be minimized.\n[0078] Second, in a multi-antenna adaptive beam forming system, a FDD\n     system may be seen to be less efficient than a TDD system because FDD\n     systems rely on feedback mechanisms between WTRU and the H(e)NB to adjust\n     the beam pattern. However, the feedback latency itself is in the order of\n     a few milli-seconds, which makes the adaptation less efficient. In a TDD\n     system, the channel state feedback, (and thus latency), is eliminated\n     since the channel is reciprocal.\n[0079] To achieve advantages similar to channel reciprocity in TDD\n     systems, E-FDD may dynamically and periodically swap UL and DL spectra so\n     that both the WTRU and the H(e)NB may estimate the channel on both\n     spectra and thus eliminate the need for channel state feedback, (and\n     associated), latency thus making the adaptive beam forming more efficient\n     in E-FDD systems.\n[0080] Described herein is variable duplex spacing in E-FDD. In licensed\n     spectrum, the UL and DL spectra are spaced 10s of MHz apart to keep the\n     RF duplexer design simple and cost-effective especially for the WTRU.\n     However, with the wideband digital transceiver, this is not a limitation.\n     The minimum duplex spacing to separate UL and DL spectra may be a\n     function of cell radius, transmitter output power and the receiver\n     sensitivity. The lower the cell radius, the lower the transmit power, and\n     the higher the sensitivity. If the available/vacant spectrum is such that\n     UL and DL spectra may not be separated by more than the minimum duplex\n     spacing, then H-FDD may be used, or FDD may be used but with adaptive\n     interference cancellation techniques to adaptively mitigate interference\n     from the transmit chain into the receive chain. The adaptive interference\n     cancellation technique may be used to mitigate self-interference\n     generated by leakage of a transmitted signal from the transmit front-end\n     into the receive front end and may be implemented as an equalizer using\n     algorithms such as normalized least means square (NLMS), Kalman\n     filtering, and the like. Generally this may be implemented in the digital\n     domain where the self-interference signal experienced by the receiver\n     front-end may be cancelled by tapping the actual transmitted signal and\n     using the tapped transmission signal as a reference signal for the\n     equalization.\n[0081] FIG. 12 shows full duplex FDD with a DL spectrum band 1205 and a UL\n     spectrum band 1210 sufficiently separated to incur no interference. FIG.\n     13 shows full duplex FDD where a DL spectrum band 1305 and a UL spectrum\n     band 1310 have minimum frequency separation. In this instance H-FDD or\n     adaptive interference cancellation techniques may be used. FIG. 14 shows\n     half duplex FDD where a DL spectrum band 1405 and a UL spectrum band 1410\n     have less than a minimum frequency separation. FIG. 15 shows full duplex\n     FDD with adaptive interference cancellation. In the latter instance,\n     since the UL 1510 and DL 1605 spectrum are spectrally very close to each\n     other, this causes spectral leakage from the transmit chain into the\n     receive chain in the transceiver. Thus an adaptive self-interference\n     cancellation scheme like NLMS algorithm, Kalman filter, and the like to\n     equalize/cancel the interference within the transceiver may help mitigate\n     the self-interference.\n[0082] Described herein is a high level WTRU reference design\n     architecture. FIG. 16 shows an example high level modem 1600 in a WTRU to\n     support variable duplex FDD in E-FDD. The modem 1600 may include an\n     antenna 1605 coupled to or in communication with a\n     transmitter/receiver/transceiver front end 1610. The\n     transmitter/receiver/transceiver front end 1610 is in turn coupled to or\n     in communication with a wideband digital receiver 1615, a wideband\n     digital transmitter 1620 and a radio manager 1630. The wideband digital\n     receiver 1615 and the wideband digital transmitter 1620 may be mixed\n     signal components made of analog and digital parts, one for the\n     transmitter and one for the receiver. The wideband digital receiver 1616\n     may be connected to or be in communication with DL baseband processor\n     1640, the wideband digital transmitter 1620 may be connected to or be in\n     communication with an UL baseband processor 1645 and the radio manager\n     1630 may be connected to or be in communication with control signal\n     processors 1650 including MAC processors, RRC processors, a sensing\n     processor and cognitive policy engine.\n[0083] Described herein is an example implementation of the wide band\n     digital transceiver. The transceiver may have a single radio chain for\n     all waveform types, support continuous bandwidth aggregation, and also\n     support multiple simultaneous links in single band and network. The power\n     amplifier may support relatively narrowband transmissions, (single or\n     multiple adjacent carriers), and may be placed off-chip. The RF front-end\n     may have a switch-multiplexer for multi-band operation, licensed band/RAT\n     optimized filters, tunable power amplifier output matching network and\n     antenna matching network, and tunable notch filter for reduced WTRU\n     self-jamming.\n[0084] The transceiver may implement RF functions on digital logic blocks.\n     The operating frequency may range or span TVWS band covering from 512-608\n     MHz, (also referred to as the low band), and 614-698 MHz, (also referred\n     to as high band), excluding TV channel #37 which spans 608 to 614 MHz. A\n     single board may only cover either a low or high TVWS band at a given\n     time. Two boards may be needed to cover both the low and the high TVWS\n     bands. The channel spacing may be 6 MHz while the channel raster may be\n     100 kHz. The boards may be programmable as transmitters or receivers in\n     high or low TVWS bands, even in operational mode.\n[0085] The multiple physical chains may be aggregated and share a single\n     wideband digital transceiver. The mode of operation allows for both TDD\n     and Hybrid FDD although other combinations such as FDD UL and DL may be\n     achieved if two boards are used simultaneously. In FDD operation, full\n     power may be used if each board is configured for different TVWS bands.\n     Backed off power may be used if each board is configured for the same\n     TVWS band by exploiting the antenna separation loss. Synchronization\n     error may be less than .+-.1 .mu.s between the two boards on the same\n     device. Maximum switching time (i.e., Tx to Rx, Rx to Tx) is 1 usec.\n[0086] Alternatively, E-FDD may be implemented using a tunable RF front\n     end where the analog filters and duplexers are tunable in terms of their\n     carrier frequency. Bandwidth and duplex spacing between uplink and\n     downlink spectrum and the baseband physical (PHY) algorithms may control\n     these exact parameters on the fly.\n[0087] Described herein is an elastic asymmetric bandwidth provisioning\n     (E-ABP) in E-FDD. In this case, the H(e)NB may operate on TVWS. FIG. 17\n     shows an example flowchart 1700 for E-ABP. The H(e)NB may sense a wide\n     range of spectrum (1705), find vacant spectrum fragments (1710), identify\n     the total aggregate bandwidth (UL and DL bandwidth) that should be\n     supported by the femto cell (1715) and allocate that bandwidth from\n     vacant TVWS for communication within the femto cell (1720). At start up,\n     the H(e)NB may use a fixed and symmetric assignment of spectrum on either\n     direction. The spectrum for UL and DL may be common, and shared by all\n     users in the network. This may be the default spectrum assignment for the\n     UL and DL, as in the macro cell. As the WTRU moves from the macro cell to\n     the femto cell, the WTRU may connect with the H(e)NB, which constantly\n     monitors the traffic patterns and QoS requests in the UL and DL (1725).\n     The RRC layer at the H(e)NB may keep track of traffic/QoS requirements\n     across the cell and dynamically adjust the bandwidth in the DL and UL,\n     (i.e., it calculates an appropriate ratio of UL bandwidth to DL bandwidth\n     within the fixed total bandwidth to be assigned within the femto cell)\n     (1730).\n[0088] The instantaneous assignment of uplink and downlink bandwidths and\n     the exact location of white spaces over a wide range of spectrum are\n     signaled during the system acquisition phase. Information about the\n     spectrum assignment is signaled on the system information block (SIB) and\n     master information block (MIB) periodically as described below.\n[0089] Described herein is cellular system acquisition signaling\n     enhancements for E-FDD. The MIB may carry the DL bandwidth assignment\n     information. For E-FDD, the MIB may need to be modified with information\n     related to DL spectrum allocation map. i.e., a vector of zeros,\n     (indicating occupied fragments), and ones, (indicating vacant fragments),\n     where each zero or one corresponds to the occupancy of a spectrum\n     fragment. The SIB type 2 may carry the UL bandwidth information. For\n     E-FDD, the SIB type 2 may need to be modified with information related to\n     UL spectrum allocation map, i.e., a vector of zeros and ones, as\n     described herein.\n[0090] FIGS. 18A and 18B show an example table that indicates parameters\n     that may need to be signaled during system acquisition in femto systems\n     to enable E-FDD. The table indicates the message name, description and\n     comments regarding these parameters. The parameters include, for example,\n     Master_Slave_mode, Spectrum_frag_length, DL_freq_start, DL_freq_vector,\n     UL_freq_start, UL_freq_vector, Duplex_mode, DL_hop_aggreg_mode, and\n     UL_hop_aggreg_mode.\n[0091] FIG. 19 shows an example flowchart 1900 for dynamic spectrum\n     allocation for a wireless communication system employing E-FDD. The\n     wireless system may include a regulator/operator database 1905, a base\n     station 1910, a WTRU 1 1915, a WTRU 2 1920 and a WTRU N 1930\n     (collectively "WTRUs"). The regulator/operator database 1905 may be a\n     TVWS database as required by a government agency such as the Federal\n     Communications Commission or it may be an operator specific database like\n     a coexistence database to manage opportunistic use of the spectrum. The\n     base station may be an eNodeB, an H(e)NB, an Access Point and the like.\n     The base station 1910 may be in active UL and DL communication on\n     licensed spectrum with any of the WTRUs (1930). The base station 1910 may\n     determine unlicensed channel availability (1933) and may send a channel\n     query to the regulator/operator database 1905 (1936). The\n     regulator/operator database 1905 may return a channel response to the\n     base station 1910 regarding channel information and availability (1939).\n     The base station may perform a sensing operation to determine channel\n     availability (1940). Based on the channel availability information, the\n     base station 1910 may evaluate and select an unlicensed channel (1942).\n     The selected unlicensed channel may broadcast the updated spectrum\n     allocation on the MIBs and SIBs to any of the WTRUs. The base station\n     1910 may now be in active UL and DL communication on licensed spectrum\n     and/or unlicensed spectrum with any of the WTRUs. Although the term\n     unlicensed may be used herein, TVWS and/or sub-leased bands may also be\n     used as appropriate.\n[0092] The base station 1910 and the WTRUs may perform periodic and/or\n     aperiodic sensing on the unlicensed spectrum (1952 and 1955). If no\n     change in conditions, the base station 1910 remains in active UL and DL\n     communication on licensed spectrum and/or unlicensed spectrum with any of\n     the WTRUs. On the next sensing event (1962 and 1965), the sensing at the\n     WTRUs may indicate an interference, a primary/secondary user conflict or\n     the like (1967). A sensing report may be sent on the UL to the base\n     station 1910 by the WTRUs (1970). In response to the sensing report, the\n     base station 1910 may transmit updated spectrum allocation information to\n     the WTRUs using dedicated signaling such as via a MAC control element, a\n     RRCConnectionReconfiguration message or the like (1975).\n[0093] FIG. 20 shows a signaling call flow to enable E-ABP within a\n     cellular network including a WTRU 2005, a base station 2010 and an H(e)NB\n     2015. The WTRU 2006 may transmit a handover request to the base station\n     2010 (2020), which in turn may transmit an authentication request to the\n     H(e)NB 2015 (2022). The H(e)NB 2015 may then transmit an authentication\n     response to the base station 2010 (2024), which in turn may transmit a\n     handover response to the WTRU 2005 (2026).\n[0094] A spectrum_config_setup procedure 2038 may be implemented between\n     the H(e)NB 2015 and the WTRU 2005. The H(e)NB 2015 may transmit the MIB\n     over a broadcast channel (BCH)/physical BCH (PBCH) to the WTRU 2005 and\n     may transmit SIB type 1, SIB type 2 through SIB type 8 over a downlink\n     shared channel (DL-SCH)/physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) (2032,\n     2034, 2036). The WTRU 2005 may transmit data to the H(e)NB 2015 (2040)\n     and the H(e)NB 2015 may transmit data to the WTRU 2005 (2042). The H(e)NB\n     2015 may perform a periodic sensing and current traffic assessment\n     procedure (2056). After the periodic spectrum sensing, another\n     spectrum_config_setup procedure (2068) may be implemented between the\n     H(e)NB 2015 and the WTRU 2005 using the information transmitted by the\n     H(e)NB 2015 to the WTRU 2005 (2060, 2062, 2064, 2066). The WTRU 2005 may\n     transmit data to the H(e)NB 2015 (2070) and the H(e)NB 2015 may transmit\n     data to the WTRU 2005 (2072).\n[0095] FIGS. 21A, 21B and 21C show a table comparing FDD and TDD schemes\n     with the E-FDD scheme. The comparison is based on seven (7) criteria to\n     compare the three schemes. As shown in FIG. 21, the E-FDD scheme out\n     performs in six out of the seven criteria as a multiplexing scheme as\n     compared to FDD and TDD.\n[0096] In general, a method of frequency division duplexing (FDD) is\n     described herein. The method includes assessing spectrum usage for uplink\n     (UL) and downlink (DL) based on spectrum usage information, determining\n     availability of spectrum and dynamically allocating UL spectrum and the\n     DL spectrum from the spectrum in view of spectrum usage assessment and\n     spectrum availability. The spectrum may be licensed, sub-leased,\n     whitespace or unlicensed spectrum. The spectrum usage information may be\n     traffic patterns, bandwidth requirements or quality of service\n     requirements and the spectrum availability information may be based on\n     sensing or centralized database access.\n[0097] The spectrum allocation may be asymmetric and the spacing between\n     the UL spectrum and the DL spectrum may be variable. The UL and the DL\n     may communicate simultaneously on a condition that the spacing between\n     the UL spectrum and the DL spectrum is greater than a threshold.\n     Self-interference between a transmit chain and a receive chain due to\n     minimal or no duplex spacing may be mitigated by using one of adaptive\n     cancellation or hybrid FDD (H-FDD). A hybrid FDD scheme may be used to\n     prevent leakage of a transmit chain signal into a receive chain on a\n     condition that spacing between the UL spectrum and the DL spectrum is\n     less than a threshold. Alternatively, an adaptive self-interference\n     cancellation scheme may be used in the radio frequency (RF) front-end at\n     transmitter and receiver to prevent leakage of the transmit chain signal\n     into the receive chain on a condition that spacing between the UL\n     spectrum and the DL spectrum is less than a threshold.\n[0098] Dynamic allocation of available whitespace spectrum may occur in\n     the presence of a primary user and dynamic allocation of available\n     unlicensed spectrum may occur in the presence of secondary users. In\n     particular, the method further includes detecting the presence of the\n     primary user on the available whitespace spectrum on a condition that the\n     primary user is now using previously available whitespace spectrum,\n     dynamically allocating the UL spectrum and the DL spectrum around the\n     primary user\'s transmission in the previously available unlicensed\n     spectrum, and maintaining communication between a base station and at\n     least one wireless transmit/receive unit regardless of the presence of\n     the primary user by avoiding interference with the primary user\n     transmission.\n[0099] The UL spectrum and/or the DL spectrum may be moved to at least one\n     of a sub-leased, whitespace or unlicensed spectrum due to operational\n     conditions, where the UL spectrum and the DL spectrum were using licensed\n     spectrum. Dynamic swapping between the licensed spectrum and at least one\n     of sub-leased, whitespace or unlicensed spectrum may occur. In\n     particular, the method may include determining at least one of\n     sub-leased, whitespace or unlicensed channel availability, selecting at\n     least one of sub-leased, whitespace or unlicensed channel based on\n     bandwidth requirement for the UL and the DL, allocating a selected\n     sub-leased, whitespace or unlicensed channel, and communicating on an\n     allocated sub-leased, whitespace or unlicensed channel and a licensed\n     channel. A portion of the UL spectrum or the DL spectrum may be allocated\n     to the remaining one of the DL spectrum or the UL spectrum, respectively.\n     The licensed spectrum may be aggregated with at least one of sub-leased,\n     whitespace or unlicensed spectrum, where the UL spectrum and the DL\n     spectrum may both include aggregated licensed spectrum and unlicensed\n     spectrum.\n[0100] Although features and elements are described above in particular\n     combinations, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that each\n     feature or element can be used alone or in any combination with the other\n     features and elements. In addition, the methods described herein may be\n     implemented in a computer program, software, or firmware incorporated in\n     a computer-readable medium for execution by a computer or processor.\n     Examples of computer-readable media include electronic signals\n     (transmitted over wired or wireless connections) and computer-readable\n     storage media. Examples of computer-readable storage media include, but\n     are not limited to, a read only memory (ROM), a random access memory\n     (RAM), a register, cache memory, semiconductor memory devices, magnetic\n     media such as internal hard disks and removable disks, magneto-optical\n     media, and optical media such as CD-ROM disks, and digital versatile\n     disks (DVDs). A processor in association with software may be used to\n     implement a radio frequency transceiver for use in a WTRU, UE, terminal,\n     base station, RNC, or any host computer.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

{'abstract': u'\n\n A wireless transmit/receive units (WTRUs) receives a downlink\n     transmission from a Node-B and decodes the downlink transmission.

For the downlink shared services, the same data\n     stream is intended for a plurality of WTRUs that are known or thought to\n     be in a cell, and the network may allow the data to be viewable to other\n     WTRUs. Guarantee of data delivery to some or most of the WTRUs is\n     important and a mechanism to provide such a guarantee should be\n     supported.\n[0004] Using HS-PDSCH or similar channel for delivery of the downlink\n     shared services offers several advantages. The HS-PDSCH is a shared\n     physical channel well suited for delivery of services across a wide-range\n     of quality of service (QoS) classes. The HS-PDSCH is also optimized for\n     packet services as most shared services are likely to be, (e.g., a\n     forward access channel (FACH) data and MBMS data are most likely\n     packetized). The HS-PDSCH also supports hybrid automatic repeat request\n     (HARQ), which, if combined with an appropriate feedback mechanism, can be\n     used to guarantee or significantly improve packet delivery.\n[0005] In order to take advantage of the HARQ mechanism of HS-PDSCH, a\n     feedback mechanism is required which allows the WTRUs to send a positive\n     acknowledgement (ACK) or a negative acknowledgement (NACK) feedback to a\n     Node-B. In high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), the ACK or NACK\n     message is delivered to the Node-B via a dedicated uplink channel, (i.e.,\n     high speed dedicated physical control channel (HS-DPCCH)). This not only\n     guarantees availability of channel resources to deliver the ACK or NACK\n     message, it also allows the Node-B to identify which WTRU a particular\n     ACK or NACK message originates from.\n[0006] Additionally, performance of HSDPA is significantly enhanced\n     through the availability of channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback from\n     the WTRUs. Conventionally, the CQI is also sent via the HS-DPCCH and the\n     Node-B may identify the source of the CQI.\n[0007] While the approach above is practical when the HS-PDSCH is\n     primarily used to carry dedicated data in a CELL_DCH state, it is no\n     longer practical for delivery of shared data or dedicated data when the\n     WTRUs are operating in a CELL_FACH state. Any other currently available\n     mechanisms for delivery of ACK/NACK and CQI feedback are insufficient for\n     state operation outside of CELL_DCH state, (i.e., when dedicated\n     resources are unavailable). There may be a very large number of WTRUs\n     listening to a particular shared service in a cell. Dedicating a resource\n     to these WTRUs and requiring ACK/NACK feedback of every single packet\n     from these WTRUs will have a highly detrimental impact on the uplink\n     capacity of the communication systems. Moreover, WTRUs not registered in\n     a cell cannot have an access to the resources.\n[0008] Since a dedicated resource is not allocated in a CELL_FACH state,\n     the only currently available alternative for delivering an ACK or NACK\n     message and a CQI is via a random access channel (RACH). Delivering an\n     ACK or NACK message and a CQI via a RACH would likely to have a severe\n     impact on the uplink capacity and is not practical. If the ACK or NACK\n     messages and a CQI are delivered from all WTRUs, given that the downlink\n     data is shared among a large number of WTRUs, conventional RACH operation\n     may require a large number of retransmission of almost all data.\n     Therefore, delivering feedback via a RACH is impractical.\n[0009] It would be desirable to provide a mechanism for feedback from\n     WTRUs for a downlink shared service, while the impact on the uplink and\n     downlink capacity is minimal.\nSUMMARY\n[0010] A method and apparatus for providing feedback for a downlink shared\n     service transmitted to a plurality of WTRUs is disclosed. A WTRU receives\n     a downlink transmission from a Node-B and decodes the downlink\n     transmission. If the decoding is not successful, the WTRU sends a\n     pre-defined burst signifying a NACK to the Node-B via a contention-based\n     shared feedback channel. The pre-defined burst may be sent only once\n     without requiring an acknowledgement from the Node-B. The Node-B\n     calibrates a downlink transmit power on the downlink shared channel so\n     that the downlink transmission is transmitted to the WTRUs with a high\n     likelihood of success of being received. The Node-B increases a transmit\n     power for the downlink transmission based on a predetermined function\n     when the Node-B receives a NACK, and decreases the transmit power when\n     the Node-B does not receive any NACK.\n[0011] The Node-B may send a downlink transmission including at least two\n     data streams processed using different modulation and coding schemes\n     (MCSs) so that a WTRU having a high signal quality decodes all the data\n     streams while a WTRU having a low signal quality decodes less than all\n     data streams. The Node-B may also send at least one channel quality\n     indicator (CQI) threshold so that each WTRU measures a CQI on the\n     received downlink transmission and determines which data stream each WTRU\n     should provide feedback based on the CQI threshold and the measured CQI.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0012] A more detailed understanding of the invention may be had from the\n     following description, given by way of example and to be understood in\n     conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:\n[0013] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example WTRU in accordance with one\n     embodiment;\n[0014] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example Node-B in accordance with\n     one embodiment;\n[0015] FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of a process for providing feedback for a\n     downlink shared service via a downlink shared channel in accordance with\n     one embodiment;\n[0016] FIG. 4 shows one possible power variation scheme of an HS-PDSCH;\n     and\n[0017] FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of a process for providing feedback for a\n     downlink shared service transmitted to a plurality of WTRUs via HSDPA in\n     accordance with another embodiment.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n[0018] When referred to hereafter, the terminology "WTRU" includes but is\n     not limited to a user equipment (UE), a mobile station, a fixed or mobile\n     subscriber unit, a pager, a cellular telephone, a personal digital\n     assistant (PDA), a computer, or any other type of user device capable of\n     operating in a wireless environment. When referred to hereafter, the\n     terminology "Node-B" includes but is not limited to a base station, a\n     site controller, an access point (AP), or any other type of interfacing\n     device capable of operating in a wireless environment.\n[0019] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an example WTRU 100 in accordance with\n     one embodiment. The WTRU 100 includes a transmitter 102, a receiver 104,\n     a decoder 106, and a CQI measurement unit 108 (optional). The receiver\n     104 receives signals from a Node-B. The decoder 106 decodes the received\n     signal from the Node-B. The decoder 106 may decode a high speed shared\n     control channel (HS-SCCH) signal while the WTRU 100 is in a Cell_FACH\n     state. The decoder 106 may decode a downlink transmission on a high speed\n     physical downlink shared channel (HS-PDSCH) if the WTRU 100 successfully\n     decodes an identity (ID) of the WTRU 100 on the signal on the HS-SCCH.\n     The transmitter 102 sends feedback, (i.e., a CQI or an acknowledgement\n     based on the decoding of the downlink transmission), to a Node-B via a\n     contention-based shared feedback channel, which will be explained in\n     detail below. The CQI measurement unit 108 outputs a CQI, which will be\n     explained in detail below.\n[0020] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of an example Node-B 200 in accordance\n     with the present invention. The Node-B 200 includes an encoder 202, a\n     transmitter 204, a receiver 206, and a transmit power and MCS control\n     unit 208. The encoder 202 encodes data stream(s) for transmission. The\n     transmitter 204 sends a downlink transmission including the encoded data\n     stream(s) for a downlink shared service to a plurality of WTRUs via a\n     downlink shared channel. The transmit power and MCS control unit 208\n     controls a downlink transmit power and/or an MCS on the downlink shared\n     channel so that the downlink transmissions are transmitted to the WTRUs\n     with a high likelihood of success of being received. The receiver 206\n     receives feedback from the WTRUs via a contention-based shared feedback\n     channel.\n[0021] FIG. 3 is a flow diagram of a process 300 for providing feedback\n     for a downlink shared service via a downlink shared channel in accordance\n     with one embodiment. A WTRU 100 receives a downlink transmission via a\n     downlink shared channel for a downlink shared service that is provided to\n     a plurality of WTRUs from a Node-B 200 (step 302). The WTRU 100 decodes\n     the downlink transmission (step 304). If the decoding is not successful,\n     the WTRU 100 sends a pre-defined burst signifying a negative\n     acknowledgement (NACK) to the Node-B 200 via a contention-based shared\n     feedback channel (step 306). The pre-defined burst may be sent only once\n     without requiring an acknowledgement from the Node-B 200. If the decoding\n     is successful, the WTRU 100 does not send feedback, (i.e., an ACK is\n     implicit).\n[0022] A new uplink shared feedback channel, a physical random access\n     feedback channel (P-RAFCH), is introduced for sending the feedback from\n     the WTRU 100 to the Node-B 200. The P-RAFCH is a contention-based random\n     access channel. At least one P-RAFCH may be associated with each HS-SCCH\n     in the downlink. If several downlink shared services are supported over\n     the HS-PDSCH(s), a set of P-RAFCHs are provided for the downlink shared\n     services and each P-RAFCH may be dedicated to a particular downlink\n     shared service.\n[0023] The configuration of the shared feedback channel, (i.e., P-RAFCH),\n     may be communicated via system information block (SIB) and may vary\n     cell-by-cell. Alternatively, the shared feedback channel configuration\n     may be signaled through dedicated RRC signaling to the WTRUs that have a\n     connection to the radio access network (RAN), (e.g., WTRUs operating in a\n     CELL_FACH state). The Node-B 200 broadcasts available scrambling codes\n     and access slots for the shared feedback channel. The access slot\n     duration may be the same as for the conventional RACH, and may be\n     matched, (i.e., derived), to the transmission time interval (TrI) of the\n     downlink shared services. When a WTRU 100 needs to provide feedback, the\n     WTRU 100 randomly selects a code and an access slot associated with a\n     particular TTI on a particular downlink shared service and sends its\n     feedback.\n[0024] In transmission of the feedback, (i.e., the pre-defined burst), no\n     transmit power ramp-up mechanism is used, in contrast to the conventional\n     RACH. The WTRU 100 may send each feedback only once and does not require\n     acknowledgement of its receipt from the Node-B 200. The transmit power\n     for the feedback may be determined based on the received power measured\n     on a reference channel, (e.g., common pilot channel (CPICH), HS-PDSCH,\n     etc.), and a network-supplied offset. The offset value may be included in\n     an SIB. Alternatively, the network may instruct the WTRU 100 to use an\n     absolute power, and provides a rule when the WTRU 100 is allowed to\n     provide feedback. For example, the WTRU 100 may be permitted to send\n     feedback only if the received reference channel power is above a\n     pre-defined value.\n[0025] If the WTRU 100 has selected a Node-B out of several synchronized\n     Node-Bs which transmit the same downlink transmission, the WTRU 100\n     transmits a NACK only to that selected Node-B. If the WTRU 100 performs\n     soft combining of signals from a plurality of Node-Bs in an active set,\n     the WTRU 100 sends a NACK to the strongest Node-B in the active set.\n[0026] The WTRU 100 may send a NACK each time the WTRU 100 fails to decode\n     the downlink transmission. Alternatively, the WTRU 100 may send a NACK\n     after two or more successive downlink transmissions have failed. For\n     example, the WTRU 100 may send a NACK only if m out of n successive\n     transmissions have failed. The numbers m and n may be determined by the\n     network. For the purpose of counting m out of n, original transmissions,\n     re-transmissions, both, or relative combination of both may be counted.\n     The ability to actually send the NACK may depend on some random number\n     with probability set by the network. The network may indicate desired\n     transmission of the NACK on a cell different from the one where the\n     downlink shared service, (e.g., MBMS), is received. The cell is indicated\n     by the network.\n[0027] In one embodiment, the feedback may be anonymous. If the feedback\n     goes through, the Node-B 200 knows that some WTRU in the cell was not\n     able to decode the downlink transmission in a particular TTI.\n     Alternatively, the WTRU ID may be signaled. In accordance with one\n     embodiment, the downlink shared service may be mapped to a WTRU-specific\n     signature code that will be transmitted as the payload of the P-RAFCH. In\n     accordance with another embodiment, a WTRU connection ID may be signaled\n     along with the feedback. In accordance with yet another embodiment, the\n     access opportunities to the contention-based shared feedback channel may\n     be mapped to the downlink shared service so that the WTRU ID may be\n     verified based on the predefined mapping. The mapping may be transmitted\n     by the network.\n[0028] The Node-B 200 calibrates the transmit power and/or adjusts an MCS\n     of the downlink shared channel carrying the shared downlink service so\n     that it covers the desired coverage area, (i.e., cell or a sector of a\n     cell), with a high likelihood. With the transmit power and/or MCS\n     adjustment, the probability that a WTRU 100 will not receive the downlink\n     data in a TTI can be set to a desired operating point, preferably near\n     zero. Since a WTRU 100 sending a NACK is almost certainly at the edge of\n     the cell or sector, the downlink power computation should be done under\n     this assumption. Since the Node-B 200 knows the cell or sector size, the\n     Node-B 200 may configure the downlink transmit power and/or MCS so that\n     it does not significantly interfere with other signals. Consequently,\n     only very few WTRUs may need to send a NACK for any single TTI. With this\n     the approach, where feedback power is fixed, a rule may be set to\n     prohibit WTRUs from sending feedback.\n[0029] Since a WTRU 100 sending a NACK is almost certainly at the edge of\n     the cell or sector, the uplink transmit power on the shared feedback\n     channel, (e.g., P-RAFCH), may be determined under this assumption. Since\n     the Node-B 200 knows the cell or sector size, the Node-B 200 configures\n     the uplink transmit power such that it does not significantly interfere\n     with other signals at the Node-B 200.\n[0030] Under the above assumption, (very few NACKs expected per TTI), the\n     Node-B 200 may allocate enough shared feedback channel resources so that\n     the probability of collision for a NACK is kept low and the Node-B 200 is\n     able to receive a large number of NACKs without severely impacting the\n     uplink capacity.\n[0031] If the Node-B 200 receives at least one NACK, the Node-B 200\n     schedules a retransmission for which the NACK is received. In this way,\n     the HS-PDSCH operates as it conventionally does under normal HSDPA\n     operation. Packet delivery is guaranteed to the same extent as it is\n     guaranteed under the current HARQ, (i.e., subject to a maximum limit on\n     re-transmissions and errors in the feedback of NACKs).\n[0032] The Node-B may maintain a threshold value and retransmit the\n     downlink transmission only if the number of NACKs from the WTRUs exceeds\n     the threshold value. While data delivery is not guaranteed, it is\n     guaranteed that no more than a few WTRUs are unhappy. This limits the\n     impact on the downlink shared service throughput of a small number of\n     WTRUs. Alternatively, the Node-B 200 may ignore the NACKs. The Node-B 200\n     may allocate no resources to the shared feedback channel to obtain the\n     same result.\n[0033] The Node-B 200 may pool the NACKs, (i.e., keep track of data that\n     needs retransmission), and retransmit multiple downlink transmissions at\n     a later time as a single packet. In this case, a sequence number and\n     buffering may need to be extended.\n[0034] The Node-B 200 may implement the following downlink power control\n     mechanism for the HS-PDSCH. Let P.sub.n be the HS-PDSCH power reference,\n     (i.e., power per bit), for TTI n. If a NACK is received, the Node-B 200\n     may set the transmit power reference for TTI (n+1) as follows:\n  P.sub.n+1=P.sub.n+f(num. of NACKs).DELTA..sub.NACK; or  Equation (1)\n  P.sub.n+1=P.sub.MAX  Equation (2)\n If the Node-B 200 receives no NACKs, the Node-B 200 may set the transmit\n     power reference for TTI (n+1) as follows:\n  P.sub.n+1=P.sub.n-.DELTA..sub.ACK.  Equation (3)\n Here, .DELTA..sub.ACK, .DELTA..sub.NACK>0, f( ) is a positive\n     non-decreasing (but may be constant) function of its argument. If the\n     Node-B 200 does not receive any NACKs, the Node-B 200 may bring the\n     transmit power reference down by a pre-defined decrement. As soon as a\n     NACK is received, the transmit power reference may be increased by a\n     pre-defined increment. The pre-defined increment and decrement may or may\n     not be the same. The increase may depend on the number of NACKs received\n     (but maybe constant). The increase increment f(num. of\n     NACKs).DELTA..sub.ACK is preferably much larger than the decrease\n     decrement .DELTA..sub.ACK. FIG. 4 shows one possible power variation\n     scheme of an HS-PDSCH.\n[0035] The actual transmit power in TTI n depends on P.sub.n and the data\n     format selected for the data, as it does conventionally. Additionally, a\n     maximum and a minimum power may be set to limit the actual transmit\n     power.\n[0036] In addition to, or as an alternative to, the transmit power\n     control, the Node-B 200 may adjust an MCS of the downlink shared service\n     in a similar fashion. When no NACK is received, the Node-B 200 may\n     increase the MCS order, and when at least one NACK is received, the\n     Node-B 200 may lower the MCS order.\n[0037] For both power control and MCS control, the Node-B 200 may consider\n     the resources allocated to other services in determining the range of\n     possible transmit power and MCS. For instance, if the load created by\n     other services is low, the Node-B 200 may increase its transmission power\n     and/or reduce the MCS utilized for the downlink shared services, which\n     allows more WTRUs to decode the service.\n[0038] When the Node-B 200 needs to know how many WTRUs are listening to\n     the downlink shared service, the Node-B 200 may temporarily, (e.g., one\n     (1) TTI), request all WTRUs to send NACKs. For this, the Node-B 200 may\n     send a special burst or a data sequence with intentionally erroneous CRC\n     check. This will force all WTRUs to respond with a NACK. The Node-B 200\n     counts the number of received NACKs, making allowances for losses due to\n     fading and collisions. Not only does this provide a count that should be\n     approximately correct, but if the NACK power is "absolute", (as opposed\n     to relative to a received power), a distribution of uplink channel\n     qualities is also obtained.\n[0039] FIG. 5 is a flow diagram of a process 500 for providing feedback\n     for downlink shared services to WTRUs via HSDPA in accordance with\n     another embodiment. A WTRU 100 receives a signaling on an HS-SCCH from a\n     Node-B 200 while the WTRU is in a Cell_FACH state (step 502). The WTRU\n     100 decodes a downlink transmission on an HS-PDSCH if the WTRU 100\n     successfully decodes an identity of the WTRU 100 on the signaling on the\n     HS-SCCH (step 504). The WTRU 100 sends an acknowledgement to the Node-B\n     200 based on the decoding of the downlink transmission via a\n     contention-based shared feedback channel (step 506). The transmission on\n     the shared feedback channel and the signaling on the HS-SCCH have a fixed\n     timing relationship.\n[0040] One shared feedback channel comprises one scrambling code and one\n     channelization code in the uplink. At least one shared feedback channel\n     is associated with each HS-SCCH in the downlink. The shared feedback\n     channel is shared amongst all WTRUs in a CELL_FACH that are requested to\n     monitor the associated HS-SCCH.\n[0041] Transmission over the shared feedback channel by different WTRUs is\n     time multiplexed, and follows a timing restriction with respect to the\n     signaling over the HS-SCCH. More specifically, a WTRU 100 transmits an\n     ACK or NACK message over the associated shared feedback channel at a\n     fixed time interval after having successfully decoded its WTRU ID, (i.e.,\n     high speed radio network temporary identity (H-RNTI)) over the HS-SCCH.\n     The duration of the time interval should be set such that it is long\n     enough for the WTRU 100 to receive and decode the data on the HS-PDSCH\n     and evaluate whether there was an error, (i.e., cyclic redundancy check\n     (CRC) verification), yet short enough to allow the Node-B 200 to quickly\n     retransmit an erroneous transport block as part of the HARQ processing.\n     The transmission over the shared feedback channel must last at most one\n     (1) TTI length to avoid collisions between WTRUs transmitting feedback.\n     Moreover, an adequate guard period should be defined to avoid WTRUs with\n     different timing offsets, (e.g., near-far problem), from colliding when\n     transmitting over the shared feedback channel.\n[0042] The information and parameters related to the shared feedback\n     channel may be signaled to the WTRU 100 at the same time as\n     HS-SCCH-related information is signaled, either through an SIB over the\n     broadcast control channel (BCCH)/broadcast channel (BCH) or through\n     dedicated RRC signaling, (e.g., new information element (IE) in the RRC\n     CONNECTION SETUP message).\n[0043] The transmission power at which a WTRU 100 sends the feedback may\n     be set based on the received power measured on a reference channel,\n     (e.g., CPICH, HS-PDSCH, etc.), and a network-supplied offset value. The\n     offset value may be part of the SIB. Alternatively, the network may\n     instruct the WTRU 100 to use an absolute power, but provides a rule when\n     the WTRU 100 is allowed to provide feedback. For example, the WTRU 100\n     may be allowed to send the feedback if the received reference channel\n     power is below a pre-defined value. Alternatively, the conventional\n     HS-SCCH may be modified to include power control information related to\n     the transmission of feedback over the shared feedback channel. Power\n     offset or relative power command, (e.g., increase or decrease), bits may\n     be introduced in the HS-SCCH to adjust the transmission power of the WTRU\n     over the shared feedback channel. Optionally, the WTRU 100 may include\n     channel quality information in the feedback.\n[0044] A scheme for sending a CQI via the P-RAFCH is disclosed\n     hereinafter. A CQI is also transmitted via the P-RAFCH. While the CQI\n     feedback may be either scheduled or triggered, the Node-B must be able to\n     differentiate between NACK only feedback, CQI only feedback, and CQI\n     feedback which is triggered by a NACK, (i.e., NACK+CQI). The P-RAFCH\n     burst includes a data type indicator for indicating NACK only, CQI only\n     or NACK+CQI, a data field for carrying CQI bits if needed, and a\n     reference field for carrying a modulation phase and power reference, if\n     needed.\n[0045] These fields may be mapped into the burst by time division\n     multiplexing (TDM), (i.e., each data is transmitted in its own time\n     segment). Alternatively, the fields may be mapped into the burst by code\n     division multiplexing (CDM), (e.g., a signature based structure as in the\n     PRACH preamble). Alternatively, the fields may be mapped into the burst\n     by frequency division multiplexing (FDM). FDM is particularly appropriate\n     for systems, such as long term evolution (LTE), where a number of\n     sub-carriers may be utilized. The basic physical channel resources for\n     carrying these fields may be, but not necessarily, orthogonal at least at\n     the WTRU.\n[0046] The data field, if present, may use any multi-dimensional\n     modulation schemes with each physical channel resource (time slot,\n     signature, carrier, etc.) providing a dimension in the modulation vector\n     space. Some examples of possible modulation schemes are as follows:\n[0047] (1) Multi-dimensional m-phase shift keying (PSK) (including binary\n     phase shift keying (BPSK) (m=2), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)\n     (m=4)), m is an integer power of 2. The number of physical channel\n     resources required is\n    M /  log 2     m  , ##EQU00001##\n and additional phase and power reference is required.\n[0048] (2) Multi-dimensional m-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)\n     (including BPSK (m=2) and QPSK (m=4)), m is an integer power of 2. The\n     number of physical channel resources required is\n    M /  log 2     m  , ##EQU00002##\n and additional phase and power reference is required.\n[0049] (3) m-ary orthogonal modulation. The number of physical channel\n     resources required is M (i.e., m=M), and additional phase and power\n     reference is not needed.\n[0050] (4) m-ary bi-orthogonal modulation. The number of physical channel\n     resources required is M/2 (i.e., m=M/2), and additional phase and power\n     reference is required.\n[0051] (5) Multi-dimensional on-off keying, (i.e., M/2 carriers are either\n     with or without power). The number of physical channel resources required\n     is M/2, (i.e., m=M/2), and additional phase and power reference is not\n     required.\n[0052] The modulation scheme to be used should be signaled to the WTRU.\n     Certain modulation schemes may require the use of a phase and power\n     reference, while others do not. The reference, if required, may be sent\n     together with the data type indicator. The data type indicator and the\n     reference field may be sent on separate physical resources.\n     Alternatively, only the data type indicator is sent and the reference\n     field is derived from it using decisions feedback, (i.e., the data type\n     indicator is assumed to be demodulated correctly, which permits its\n     re-use as a reference signal).\n[0053] Additionally, in order to avoid the explicit transmission of the\n     data type indicator, a CQI may always be triggered by the need to\n     transmit a NACK, (i.e., a NACK and a CQI are always sent together).\n     Alternatively, if a NACK is sent and a CQI does not need to be sent, the\n     data field corresponding to the highest CQI value may be used. These\n     types of transmissions are referred to as an implicit data type format.\n     The use of this format should be signaled to the WTRU.\n[0054] The Node-B detects the presence of power over the complete burst.\n     If power is detected in a burst space, and a data type indicator is used,\n     the Node-B reads the data type indicator. If a CQI is present, the CQI is\n     demodulated according to the modulation scheme used. If the implicit data\n     type format is used, the presence of power indicates a NACK and a CQI\n     transmission.\n[0055] Because of the multicast nature of the transmissions and the need\n     to serve most or all WTRUs, the Node-B may collect CQIs over some time\n     period. The Node-B selects the minimum CQI over this time period and\n     schedules data rates according to the minimum CQI. In this manner all\n     WTRUs may be highly likely to be served.\n[0056] This scheme does, however, have a disadvantage that a WTRU with a\n     bad channel condition may significantly reduce the throughput of the\n     whole system. The Node-B has no way to identify that such a WTRU exists\n     in a direct way because all feedback from the WTRUs is anonymous. In\n     order to solve this problem, the Node-B may collect statistics about CQI\n     transmissions and may ignore any CQIs that are statistically very far\n     from the majority. The Node-B may then select a minimum CQI from the\n     remaining CQIs and uses that as a baseline.\n[0057] Alternatively, the Node-B may select a certain small subset, (e.g.,\n     lower 20% or lower 10%), of CQIs after the removal of outliers. The\n     Node-B may then use an average of these, (e.g. the actual average, a\n     median, etc.). Because of the multicast nature, the highest CQIs are\n     unlikely to have any impact on the system operation. Thus, the WTRU may\n     not send the highest possible CQI value.\n[0058] Another embodiment of layer 2/3 (L2/3) based operation is disclosed\n     hereinafter. A WTRU 100 listens to network signaling which tells the WTRU\n     100 when, how often, and to whom to report feedback to the downlink\n     shared service. The WTRU 100 decodes signals on an allocated TTI for a\n     shared downlink service. The WTRU 100 then collects statistics of\n     decoding success or failure rate and compares to the decoding statistics\n     to a pre-defined threshold that is provided by the network. The WTRU 100\n     sends feedback if the decoding statistics is worse than the pre-defined\n     threshold.\n[0059] If the WTRU 100 has selected a Node-B out of several synchronized\n     Node-Bs which transmit the same data, the WTRU 100 transmits the feedback\n     to that selected Node-B only. If the WTRU 100 performs soft combining of\n     signals from a plurality of Node-Bs in an active set, the WTRU 100 sends\n     the feedback to the strongest Node-B in the active set.\n[0060] The network may indicate desired transmission of the NACK on a cell\n     different from the one where the downlink shared service, (e.g., MBMS),\n     is received. The cell is indicated by the network.\n[0061] The downlink shared service may be mapped to a code that will be\n     transmitted with the NACK. Alternatively WTRU connection ID may be\n     signaled. Alternatively, if using a PRACH for the feedback, the physical\n     channel access opportunities may be mapped to the downlink shared\n     service. The mapping may be indicated by the network. If needed, CQI\n     information may be transmitted together with the NACK or in its place.\n     Since the signaling is at L2/3, a larger number of bits are supported in\n     a straightforward fashion.\n[0062] Some downlink shared services, (e.g., video), may use a layered QoS\n     mechanism where certain users get higher throughput and quality than\n     others. In a wireless system, an important factor that determines the QoS\n     of a user is the throughput achievable given the location of the user in\n     the system. The maximum throughput achievable at cell edge is typically\n     less than the one achievable around the cell center. The layered QoS may\n     be supported without feedback from dedicated physical channels.\n[0063] One conventional layered QoS mechanism, (e.g., digital video\n     broadcasting (DVB)), is based on hierarchical modulation. In hierarchical\n     modulation, multiple data streams, (typically a high-priority and a\n     low-priority), are modulated into a single signal that is received by all\n     users. Users with good signal quality may decode both data streams while\n     users with low signal quality may decode only the high-priority stream.\n     For instance, the streams may be encoded as a 16 quadrature amplitude\n     modulation (16QAM) signal. The quadrant where the signal is located\n     represents two high priority bits whereas the position of the signal\n     within the quadrant represents two low priority bits. Users with good\n     signal quality are able to decode the signal as 16QAM while users with\n     low signal quality can only decode the signal as quadrature phase shift\n     keying (QPSK) and extract only the high priority bits.\n[0064] In accordance with the present teachings, some new signaling is\n     provided. From the network point of view, it would be unsatisfactory that\n     all WTRUs report their ACK or NACK feedback based on decoding of the high\n     priority stream only because it would lack information about the\n     performance of favorably located WTRUs. On the other hand, having all\n     WTRUs providing feedback based on decoding of all streams is also\n     unsatisfactory because non-favorably located WTRUs would overload the\n     P-RAFCH with NACK.\n[0065] The network sets at least one CQI threshold to determine on which\n     stream each WTRU should provide feedback. The CQI threshold(s) is\n     signaled from the network, (e.g., on the BCCH, dedicated control channel\n     (DCCH), or MBMS control channel (MCCH) for broadcast, multicast, or\n     unicast).\n[0066] A WTRU 100 measures its own CQI (or average CQI). The WTRU 100\n     compares the measured CQI to the CQI threshold(s) and determines the\n     smallest CQI threshold higher than the measured CQI. This CQI threshold\n     corresponds to a certain subset of stream(s) that the WTRU 100 needs to\n     report feedback. The WTRU 100 reports ACK or NACK feedback on the\n     decoding of the subset of stream(s) determined based on the CQI\n     comparison. It is possible to further restrict the subset of streams to\n     report feedback based on WTRU subscription to the high quality service.\n[0067] A particular CQI threshold may be set below which the WTRU 100 is\n     not allowed to provide feedback. For example, in the case that there are\n     only two streams, (high priority stream and low priority stream), and two\n     CQI thresholds, (high CQI threshold and low CQI threshold), are set, if\n     the measured CQI is above the high CQI threshold, the WTRU 100 may report\n     feedback on both high priority and low priority streams. If the measured\n     CQI is below the high CQI threshold but above the low CQI threshold, the\n     WTRU 100 may report feedback on the high priority stream only. If the\n     measured CQI is below the low CQI threshold, the WTRU 100 may not provide\n     feedback at all.\n[0068] The Node-B 200 may change the CQI threshold(s) from time to time\n     based on load conditions. For instance, in case the load of the Node-B\n     200 due to other services is low, the Node-B 200 may allocate more\n     resources to the downlink shared services and employ less aggressive MCS\n     to encode the streams, which allows more WTRUs to enjoy high QoS. In case\n     of high contention between the downlink shared services and other\n     services, the Node-B 200 may use more aggressive MCS to transmit the\n     streams thereby reducing the amount of resources for the downlink shared\n     services.\n[0069] Alternatively, the multiple streams may be transmitted separately\n     in different time or using different codes. For instance, a high priority\n     stream may be transmitted with a less aggressive MCS while a low priority\n     stream may be transmitted with a more aggressive MCS. This allows more\n     flexibility in the selection of the MCS and CQI thresholds for decoding\n     the streams.

 'patent_description': u'CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n[0001] This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S.\n     Provisional Application No. 62/163,604, filed May 19, 2015, and U.S.\n     Provisional Application No. 62/256,938, filed Nov. 18, 2015.\n       FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY\n[0002] The following relates to a vaporizer and more specifically to\n     embodiments of a vaporizer having an improved contact surface for\n     vaporization of essential oils, herbs, and extracts.\nBACKGROUND\n[0003] Vaporizers are used for the purpose of vaporizing essential oils,\n     herbs, or extracts. The vaporizers include a surface upon which the\n     essential oils, herbs, or extracts are heated on until vaporization\n     occurs. A number of factors are considered when selecting the material\n     that comprises the surface for vaporizing the oils, including thermal and\n     chemical properties, such as efficient heat transfer and the ability to\n     withstand surface adhesion of the oils for easy maintenance and surface\n     cleanup, and machinability for assembly and manufacture.\n[0004] Silicon carbide (SiC) is a compound widely used in the field of\n     semiconductor electronic applications, particularly, in high temperature\n     environments. Silicon carbide has a high thermal conductivity and\n     chemical resistance. However, silicon carbide exhibits poor machinability\n     as it relates to the manufacture and assembly. Materials such as natural\n     sapphire, synthetic sapphire, optical quartz, and semi conducting quartz\n     also exhibit poor machinability. For instance, standard or conventional\n     design concepts like screw threading cannot be used, and a designer would\n     need to accommodate its low fracture toughness and other undesirable\n     material properties.\n[0005] Accordingly, silicon carbide is not used as a material in the\n     construction of vaporizers. The materials used in the vaporization\n     industry sacrifice one or more of thermal and chemical properties in\n     exchange for a material that can be more easily manufactured and\n     assembled.\n[0006] Thus, a need exists for an apparatus and method for a vaporization\n     surface that possesses desirable thermal and chemical properties but can\n     also be efficiently machined for assembly and/or manufacture.\nSUMMARY\n[0007] A first aspect relates generally to an apparatus comprising: a\n     medium collection device having a vaporization contact surface, the\n     medium collection device configured to attach to a nail base, wherein the\n     medium collection device is comprised at least partially of silicon\n     carbide (SiC), optical or semi conducting quartz, or synthetic sapphire.\n[0008] A second aspect relates generally to a vaporizer comprising: a nail\n     base, and a vaporization component operably connected to the nail base,\n     the vaporization component including a medium collection device and a\n     coupler, wherein the coupler secures the medium collection device to the\n     nail base by threaded engagement between the coupler and the nail base\n[0009] A third aspect relates generally to a method comprising: forming a\n     medium collection device at least partially of silicon carbide, optical\n     or semi conducting quartz, or synthetic sapphire to improve a\n     vaporization contact surface, and operably coupling the medium collection\n     device to a nail base by using a coupler, so that the medium collection\n     device may not require threads, but also be securably attached to the\n     nail base.\n[0010] The foregoing and other features of construction and operation will\n     be more readily understood and fully appreciated from the following\n     detailed disclosure, taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0011] Some of the embodiments will be described in detail, with reference\n     to the following figures, wherein like designations denote like members,\n     wherein:\n[0012] FIG. 1A depicts an exploded assembly view of an embodiment of a\n     vaporizer;\n[0013] FIG. 1B depicts a front view of an embodiment of the vaporizer;\n[0014] FIG. 1C depicts a cross-sectional view along line A-A of FIG. 1B of\n     an embodiment of the vaporizer;\n[0015] FIG. 1D depicts a cross-sectional view along line A-A of FIG. 1B of\n     an embodiment of the vaporizer having medium placed within an embodiment\n     of a medium collection device;\n[0016] FIG. 2 depicts an assembled view of an embodiment of the vaporizer;\n[0017] FIG. 3 depicts a perspective view of an embodiment of the medium\n     collection device;\n[0018] FIG. 4 depicts a perspective view of an embodiment of a\n     vaporization component having a medium collection device and an\n     embodiment of a retainer coupler;\n[0019] FIG. 5 depicts a perspective view of an embodiment of the\n     vaporization component having a medium collection device and an\n     alternative embodiment of the retainer coupler;\n[0020] FIG. 6 depicts an exploded, assembly view of an embodiment of a\n     vaporizer without a heating element; and\n[0021] FIG. 7 depicts a cross-section view of an embodiment of a vaporizer\n     without a heating element.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n[0022] A detailed description of the hereinafter described embodiments of\n     the disclosed apparatus and method are presented herein by way of\n     exemplification and not limitation with reference to the Figures.\n     Although certain embodiments are shown and described in detail, it should\n     be understood that various changes and modifications may be made without\n     departing from the scope of the appended claims. The scope of the present\n     disclosure will in no way be limited to the number of constituting\n     components, the materials thereof, the shapes thereof, the relative\n     arrangement thereof, etc., and are disclosed simply as an example of\n     embodiments of the present disclosure.\n[0023] As a preface to the detailed description, it should be noted that,\n     as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms\n     "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents, unless the context clearly\n     dictates otherwise.\n[0024] Referring to the drawings, FIGS. 1A-2 depicts an embodiment of a\n     vaporizer 100. Embodiments of a vaporizer 100 may be also referred to as\n     a nail, a portable nail, an electronic nail, a heatable element, a heat\n     transfer element, or a heatable device for the vaporization and or\n     heating of a medium 35. Embodiments of vaporizer 100 may vaporize a\n     medium 35, such as an essential oil, oil, extract, herb, flavored\n     nicotine, eliquids, ejuice, flavored oil(s), or other vaporizable medium.\n     The medium 35 may be vaporized by heating the vaporizer 100, which can\n     increase the temperature of the medium 35, as will be described in\n     greater detail infra.\n[0025] Embodiments of the vaporizer 100 may include a nail base 40 and a\n     vaporizing component 50. In exemplary embodiment, the vaporizer 100 may\n     be comprised of a vaporizing component 50 operably connected to the nail\n     base 40. Embodiments of vaporizer 100 may include a medium collection\n     device 20 having a vaporization contact surface 30, the medium collection\n     device 20 configured to attach to a nail base 40, wherein the medium\n     collection device 20 is comprised of Silicon Carbide (SiC). Further\n     embodiments of vaporizer 100 may include a nail base 40 and a medium\n     collection device 20 operably connected to the nail base 40, wherein the\n     medium collection device 20 is comprised of SiC. Additional embodiments\n     of vaporizer 100 may include a medium collection device 20 having a\n     vaporization contact surface 30, the medium collection device 20\n     configured to attach to a nail base 40, wherein the medium collection\n     device 20 is comprised of optical and/or semi conducting quartz. Further\n     embodiments of vaporizer 100 may include a nail base 40 and a medium\n     collection device 20 operably connected to the nail base 40, wherein the\n     medium collection device 20 is comprised of optical and/or semi\n     conducting quartz. In yet another embodiment, vaporizer 100 may include a\n     medium collection device 20 having a vaporization contact surface 30, the\n     medium collection device 20 configured to attach to a nail base 40,\n     wherein the medium collection device 20 is comprised of synthetic\n     sapphire. Further embodiments of vaporizer 100 may include a nail base 40\n     and a medium collection device 20 operably connected to the nail base 40,\n     wherein the medium collection device 20 is comprised of synthetic\n     sapphire. Embodiments may also utilize natural sapphire.\n[0026] Embodiments of vaporizer 100 may include a nail base 40.\n     Embodiments of the nail base 40 may be referred to as a main body, a nail\n     body, a base, and the like. Embodiments of the nail base 40 may include a\n     first end 41, a second end 42, an inner surface 43, and an outer surface\n     44. The nail base 40 may include a generally annular opening 43a\n     therethrough extending between the first end 41 and the second 42. The\n     generally annular opening 43a may be an opening, a channel, a bore, a\n     gap, axial opening, and the like, or any pathway or passage that\n     allows/guides the flow of fluid, such as vapor, gas, smoke, and the like.\n     While a diameter of the central opening 43a of the nail base 40 may have\n     a consistent diameter, some embodiments of the nail base 40 may include\n     an internal lip 48a. The internal lip 48a may be a surface that extends\n     in a radial direction away from a central axis of the axial opening 43a.\n     Internal lip 48a may define an increase in the diameter of the inner\n     opening 43a of the nail base 40 proximate an external flange 48 of the\n     nail base 40. Starting from internal lip 48a, the diameter of the inner\n     opening 43a of the nail base 40 may taper or continuously increase\n     towards the second end 42 of the nail base 40. In other embodiments, nail\n     base 40 may forego an internal lip, such as lip 48a, and taper or\n     otherwise expand the diameter of the opening of the nail base 40\n     proximate, at, or otherwise near the second end 42 of the nail base 40.\n[0027] Furthermore, embodiments of the nail base 40 may include a stem\n     portion 49. Embodiments of the stem portion 49 may be cylindrical or\n     substantially cylindrical, or may have various cross-sections. The stem\n     portion 49 may be referred to as a stem or a base. The stem portion 49\n     may extend from the first end 41 to the external flange 48, or to the\n     second 42 in the event an external flange 48 is not present. At least a\n     portion of the stem portion 49, which may be a generally annular portion\n     of the nail base 40 proximate the first end 41 of the nail base 40, may\n     be configured to pass through and/or enter the central opening of the\n     vaporization component 50 (which can include the medium collection device\n     20 and a coupler 10). Thus, a diameter of the stem portion 49 of the nail\n     base 40, at least proximate the first end 41, may be sized and\n     dimensioned to fit within the opening of the vaporization component 50\n     when in an assembled position. An outer surface of the stem portion 49\n     proximate a first end 41 may include threads for threadably engaging the\n     coupler 10, as shown in FIG. 2.\n[0028] Along the stem portion 49 of the nail base 40, a heat sink\n     structure 45 may be positioned for thermal advantages, such as even and\n     efficient heat dissipation of the nail base 40. Embodiments of the heat\n     sink structure 45 may be comprised of a plurality of fins 45a that may\n     have a high heat capacity. Embodiments of the fins 45a may be generally\n     annular members that are structurally integral with the nail base 40 and\n     protrude from an external surface 44 of the nail base 40. Other\n     embodiments of a heat sink may be positioned on/along the stem portion 49\n     instead of a plurality of annular fins 45, including other cooling means.\n     Additionally, embodiments of the nail base 40 may include an external lip\n     46 proximate the second end 42 of the nail base 40. The external lip 46\n     may define an increase in wall thickness proximate the second end 42 of\n     the nail base 40. The second end 42 of the nail base 40 may be configured\n     to be connected with a suction line or suction device. For instance, the\n     second 42 may be sized and dimensioned to matingly correspond with an\n     inlet, port, receiving means, or vaporizer holder of a suction device.\n     Further, embodiments of the nail base 40 may be comprised of any\n     thermally conductive material, including metal and metal alloys.\n[0029] Referring still to FIGS. 1A-2, embodiments of the vaporizer 100 may\n     include a vaporization component 50. Embodiments of the vaporization\n     component 50 may include a medium collection device 20 and a retainer\n     coupler 10. Embodiments of the medium collection device 20 may be\n     operably connected to the retainer coupler 10 when being operably\n     connected to the nail base 40. In alternative embodiments, the retainer\n     coupler 10 may be operably connected after the medium collecting device\n     20 is operably connected to the nail base 40. In even further\n     embodiments, the vaporization component 50 may only include the medium\n     collective device 20; in other words, embodiments of vaporizer 100 may\n     not need a retainer coupler 10 to achieve an assembled position. An\n     embodiment of a fully assembled position is shown in FIG. 2, herein the\n     vaporization component 50 is operably coupled to the nail base 40.\n[0030] Referring additionally now to FIGS. 3 and 4, embodiments of the\n     medium collection device 20 may be a dish, a dish component, a fluid\n     collector, a bowl, a plate, a cup, a wafer, a cone, and the like, or any\n     device that includes a surface, a channel, groove, bowl, or an opening\n     for placing medium 35 to be vaporized. Embodiments of the medium\n     collection device 20 may include a first end 21, a second 22, an inner\n     surface 23, and an outer surface 24. For instance, medium collection\n     device 20 may include a central opening 23a defined by an annular lip 25.\n     The central opening 23a may be generally annular and axially extend along\n     a central axis of the medium collection device 20. Embodiments of the\n     opening 23a may be an entry point for vaporized medium to enter the\n     general central, hollow opening 43a of the vaporizer 100 that may be\n     configured to lead to a suction device, or a suction line. Moreover,\n     embodiments of the medium collection device 20 may include a first wall\n     26 and a second wall 27. The first wall 26 may be an outer wall having a\n     thickness defining an outer circumference or outer perimeter of the\n     medium collection device 20. The second wall 27 may be an inner wall\n     having a thickness defining the internal lip 25 within the medium\n     collection device 20. In other words, the second wall 27 may be located\n     closer to the center of the medium collection device 20 than the first\n     wall 26. A height of the second wall 27 measured from a bottom surface 28\n     of the medium collection device 30 may be less than a height of the first\n     wall 26 measured from the bottom surface 28.\n[0031] Furthermore, the first wall 26 and the second wall 27 may be\n     separated from each other by a distance. The surface of the medium\n     collection device 30 that separates the first wall 26 and the second wall\n     27 may be a vaporization contact surface 30. For instance, the first wall\n     26 and the second wall 27 may be define a channel 34 therebetween for\n     placing an amount of medium for vaporization, as shown in FIG. 1D.\n     Embodiments of the channel between the walls 26, 27 may be a channel, a\n     track, a ring, an opening, a gap, a void, and the like, being defined by\n     a floor or surface 30 and the walls 26, 27. Embodiments of the surface 30\n     may be a contact point for vaporization, wherein the contact point for\n     vaporization may be comprised of the material used for the medium\n     collection device 20, or a coating on the surface 30. When the medium 35\n     is placed within the medium collection device 20 along at least a portion\n     of the vaporization surface 30, heat may be applied/transferred via a\n     heating element, such as heating element 90, to the medium collection\n     device 20 of the vaporizer 100. The applied/transferred heat vaporizes\n     the medium 35, the vapor then being drawn through the central opening 23a\n     of the medium collection device 20 and the central opening 43a of the\n     vaporizer 100 through a negative air pressure from a suction device or\n     line operably attached to the second end 2 of the vaporizer 100. When the\n     vaporizer 100 is in an assembled position, as shown in FIG. 2, the inner\n     opening 43a of the nail base 40 may be aligned with an inner opening 23a,\n     13a of the vaporizing component 50 to form the central opening (fluid\n     pathway) of the vaporizer 100. Thus, vaporized medium 35 may flow through\n     the openings from a first end 1 of the vaporizer 100 to a second end 2 of\n     the vaporizer to an inlet of a suction device (not shown) by the use of\n     the suction device.\n[0032] Embodiments of the medium collection device 20 may be comprised of\n     silicon carbide. Silicon carbide is very chemically resistant, and may be\n     unaffected by extracts and other medium, such as medium 35, vaporized\n     through use of vaporizer 100. Silicon carbide also has a high thermal\n     conductivity that may easily facilitate a transfer of heat from the\n     heating element 90 to the medium 35. In addition, silicon carbide has a\n     low coefficient of surface adhesion that can allow the medium collection\n     device 20 to be cleaned. Because the medium collection device 20 may be\n     comprised of silicon carbide, a vaporization contact point, such as\n     surface 30 is improved for vaporization of medium 35. In alternative\n     embodiments, portions of the medium collection device 20 may be made of\n     other material(s) than silicon carbide, wherein the surface 30 that\n     directly engages or touches the medium 35 is comprised of silicon\n     carbide. In further embodiments, surface 30 may be coated with a layer of\n     silicon carbide to take advantage of the thermal and chemical properties\n     of silicon carbide, while reducing the poor machinability of the\n     material.\n[0033] Embodiments of the medium collection device 20 being made from all\n     or a portion of silicon carbide may be utilized with many different\n     configurations of nail bases, including nail base 40. For instance, the\n     embodiments of nail base 40 may not limited to the particular structural\n     configuration disclosed herein, and the medium collection device 20 may\n     still operate with its advantages on other structural configurations of a\n     vaporizer having a nail base or other base structure.\n[0034] Moreover, embodiments of the medium collection device 20 may be\n     comprised of optical or semi conducting quartz. Optical or semi\n     conducting quartz is very chemically resistant, and may be unaffected by\n     extracts and other medium, such as medium 35, vaporized through use of\n     vaporizer 100. In addition, optical or semi conducting quartz has a low\n     coefficient of surface adhesion that can allow the medium collection\n     device 20 to be cleaned. Because the medium collection device 20 may be\n     comprised of optical or semi conducting quartz, a vaporization contact\n     point, such as surface 30 is improved for vaporization of medium 35. In\n     alternative embodiments, portions of the medium collection device 100 may\n     be made of other material(s) than optical or semi conducting quartz,\n     wherein the surface 30 that directly engages or touches the medium 35 is\n     comprised of optical or semi conducting quartz. In further embodiments,\n     surface 30 may be coated with a layer of optical or semi conducting\n     quartz to take advantage of the properties of optical or semi conducting\n     quartz, while reducing the poor machinability of the material.\n[0035] Embodiments of the medium collection device 20 being made from all\n     or a portion of optical or semi conducting quartz may be utilized with\n     many different configurations of nail bases, including nail base 40. For\n     instance, the embodiments of nail base 40 may not limited to the\n     particular structural configuration disclosed herein, and the medium\n     collection device 20 may still operate with its advantages on other\n     structural configurations of a vaporizer having a nail base or other base\n     structure.\n[0036] Alternatively, embodiments of the medium collection device 20 may\n     be comprised of synthetic sapphire. Synthetic sapphire is very chemically\n     resistant, and may be unaffected by extracts and other medium, such as\n     medium 35, vaporized through use of vaporizer 100. In addition, synthetic\n     sapphire has a low coefficient of surface adhesion that can allow the\n     medium collection device 20 to be cleaned. Because the medium collection\n     device 20 may be comprised of synthetic sapphire, a vaporization contact\n     point, such as surface 30 is improved for vaporization of medium 35. In\n     alternative embodiments, portions of the medium collection device 100 may\n     be made of other material(s) than synthetic sapphire, wherein the surface\n     30 that directly engages or touches the medium 35 is comprised of\n     synthetic sapphire. In further embodiments, surface 30 may be coated with\n     a layer of synthetic sapphire to take advantage of the properties of\n     synthetic sapphire, while reducing the poor machinability of the\n     material.\n[0037] Embodiments of the medium collection device 20 being made from all\n     or a portion of synthetic sapphire may be utilized with many different\n     configurations of nail bases, including nail base 40. For instance, the\n     embodiments of nail base 40 may not limited to the particular structural\n     configuration disclosed herein, and the medium collection device 20 may\n     still operate with its advantages on other structural configurations of a\n     vaporizer having a nail base or other base structure.\n[0038] Referring back to FIGS. 1A-2, embodiments of the vaporization\n     component 50 may include a retainer coupler 10. The coupler 10 may be a\n     retainer, a retainer coupler, a coupler, a lug, a nut, a connector, and\n     the like. Embodiments of the coupler 10 may be a generally annular or\n     annular member, and may have a first end 11, a second end 12, an inner\n     surface 13, an outer surface 14, and a generally axial opening 13a\n     therethrough. The inner surface 13 may include threads for threadably\n     engaging outer threads proximate the first end 41 of the nail base 40 on\n     stem portion 49, as shown in FIG. 2. Moreover, embodiments of coupler 10\n     may include a flange 15, wherein flange 15 may protrude radially outward\n     from the outer surface 14. An underside of the flange 15 may be\n     configured to engage surface 29a of the medium collection device 20 when\n     in an assembled position. For instance, a portion of the coupler 10\n     starting from the flange 15 and extending towards the second end 12 of\n     the coupler may be received within the central axial opening 23a of the\n     medium collection device 20 when in an assembled position.\n[0039] FIG. 5 depicts an alternative embodiment of a coupler 10, wherein a\n     coupler 10 may include an additional flange 17. The additional flange 17\n     may also be referred to as a lip, shelf, annular lip, and the like. The\n     additional flange 17 may protrude radially outward from the outer surface\n     14 of the coupler 10, and may be disposed directly above the flange 15.\n     In some embodiments, there may be a gap between the flange 15 and the\n     additional flange 17. The additional flange 17 may include a surface 18,\n     which may act as a shelf for an additional medium collection device, such\n     as device 20, or a dish component made of any material. Accordingly, the\n     vaporizer 100 may have multiple dishes; the thickness of the additional\n     flange 17 (and potentially a gap between the flange 15 and the additional\n     flange 17) may define a distance between the two dishes.\n[0040] Further embodiments of vaporizer 100 may include a heating element\n     90. Embodiments of the heating element 90 may be configured to\n     apply/transfer heat to the nail base 40 and the vaporization component\n     50. Embodiments of the heating element 90 may include a heater arm 95 and\n     a heating coil 93. The heating coil 93 may be disposed between the nail\n     base 40 and the vaporization component 50 for operation of the vaporizer\n     100. For example, a fin 45a of the plurality of fins 45a closest to the\n     first end 41 of the nail base 40 may act as a shelf for the heating\n     element 90. The heating coil 93 may include an opening sized and\n     dimensioned to receive the first end 41 of the nail base 40 in the\n     assembled position. The heating coil 93 may physically mechanically\n     engage with the nail base 40 and/or the vaporization component 50 so that\n     the components are in thermal communication. As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7,\n     embodiments of the vaporizer 100 may be packaged and sold without a\n     heating element 90; the heating element 90 may be disposed between the\n     nail base 40 and the vaporization component 50 during assembly.\n[0041] Components of the vaporizer 100 may be assembled and reassembled\n     before and after use. For example, a user may operably connect the\n     vaporization component 50 to the nail base 40, and then remove the\n     vaporization component 50 for cleaning and/or storage, all without\n     damaging the vaporizer 100. Operably connection of the vaporization\n     component 50 to the nail base 40 may be a threaded connection between one\n     or more components. Due to the poor machinability of SiC, optical or semi\n     conducting quartz, and/or synthetic sapphire, embodiments of the\n     vaporizer 100 may include a means for threadably attached the medium\n     collection device 20 to the nail base 40 without a need to provide\n     threads on the medium collection device 20. For example, an inner surface\n     13 of the retainer coupler 10 may include a threaded surface, while an\n     outer surface of the stem portion 49 proximate the first end 41 of the\n     nail base 40 includes a threaded surface that threadably matingly\n     corresponds to the threaded surface of the retainer coupler 10. The\n     retainer coupler 10 may be disposed within a central opening 23a of the\n     medium collection device 20, wherein a flange 15 of the retainer coupler\n     10 engages surface 29a and potentially chamfer 29b of the medium\n     collection device 20, and the threaded surfaces of the retainer coupler\n     10 and stem portion 49 threadably engage to releasably secure, attach, or\n     otherwise connect the vaporization component 50 to the nail base 40. In\n     other words, the coupler 10 may threadably releasably secure the medium\n     collection device 20 into position with the nail base 40. Prior to\n     connection of the retainer coupler 10 and stem portion 49 of nail base\n     40, the heating element 90 may be disposed around the nail base 40 onto\n     one of the fins 45a of the plurality of fins 45. Alternative embodiments\n     may include operably connecting the vaporization component using press\n     fit machined components, axial compression, tongue and groove, ball and\n     detent, and other comparable mechanical fastening techniques.\n[0042] FIGS. 6-7 depict an embodiment of vaporizer 101. Embodiments of\n     vaporizer 101 may share the same or substantially the same structural\n     and/or functional aspects of vaporizer 100 as described above. However,\n     embodiments of vaporizer 101 may be assembled without a heating element,\n     such as heating element 90. A heating element may be utilized with\n     embodiments of vaporizer 101.\n[0043] Referring now to FIGS. 1-7, a method may include the steps of\n     forming a medium collection device 100 at least partially (or wholly) of\n     silicon carbide, optical or semi conducting quartz, or synthetic sapphire\n     to improve a vaporization contact surface, such as surface 30. Further a\n     method may include operably coupling the medium collection device 20 to\n     the nail base 40 by using a retainer coupler 10, so that the medium\n     collection device 20 may not require threads, but also be securably\n     attached to the nail base 40.\n[0044] While this disclosure has been described in conjunction with the\n     specific embodiments outlined above, it is evident that many\n     alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those\n     skilled in the art. Accordingly, the preferred embodiments of the present\n     disclosure as set forth above are intended to be illustrative, not\n     limiting. Various changes may be made without departing from the spirit\n     and scope of the invention, as required by the following claims. The\n     claims provide the scope of the coverage of the invention and should not\n     be limited to the specific examples provided herein.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

releasable, fluid-tight connecting of first and second\n     fluid-carrying components. The first and second fluid-carrying components\n     may be a variety of structures, such as conduits, tubes, fittings,\n     manifolds, etc. In one or more implementations, the coupling assembly may\n     be employed to connect a conduit (or tube) to, for instance, a liquid\n     manifold or liquid-manifold assembly of a cooling apparatus. For\n     instance, one or more features of the coupling assemblies disclosed\n     herein may be integrated with a variety of liquid manifolds. By way of\n     example only, various liquid manifolds are described below with reference\n     to FIGS. 1-9C, where the liquid manifold may be, for example, part of a\n     cooling apparatus, such as part of a coolant-cooled electronic module, or\n     be detachably coupled to a coolant-cooled electronic module, to\n     facilitate flow of liquid coolant through the module and removal of heat\n     generated within the module. Those skilled in the art will understand,\n     however, that the coupling assemblies disclosed may be, in part,\n     integrated with various types of housings, for instance, at either an\n     inlet or an outlet of the housing. Advantageously, the connectors\n     disclosed hereinbelow with reference to FIGS. 10A-12E may be used to\n     releasably secure a wide variety of fluid-carrying components together.\n[0040] Reference is made below to the drawings, which may not be drawn to\n     scale to facilitate an understanding of the invention, wherein the same\n     reference numbers used throughout different figures designate the same or\n     similar components.\n[0041] By way of example, one embodiment of an air cool data center 100 is\n     depicted in FIG. 1. As shown, in a raised floor layout of air-cooled data\n     center 100, multiple electronics racks 110 may be disposed in one or more\n     rows. A computer installation such as depicted may house several hundred,\n     or even several thousand processors. In the arrangement of FIG. 1,\n     chilled air enters the computer room via floor vents from a supply air\n     plenum 108 defined between a raised floor 106 and a base or sub-floor 104\n     of the room. Cooled air is taken in through the front or air inlet sides\n     111 of the electronics racks and expelled through the back, or air outlet\n     sides 112, of the electronics racks. Each electronics rack 110 may have\n     one or more air-moving devices (e.g., axial or centrifugal fans) to\n     provide forced inlet-to-outlet airflow to cool the electronic components\n     within the rack. Supply air plenum 108 provides conditioned and cooled\n     air to the air-inlet sides of the electronics racks via perforated floor\n     tiles 115 disposed (in one embodiment) in a "cold" air aisle of the data\n     center. The conditioned and cooled air is supplied to plenum 108 by one\n     or more air-conditioning units 120, which may also be disposed within\n     data center 100. Room air 121 is taken into each air-conditioning unit\n     150 near an upper portion thereof. In the depicted embodiment, this room\n     air comprises in part exhausted air from the "hot" air aisles of the data\n     center defined by opposing air outlet sides 112 of electronics racks 110.\n[0042] Due to the ever-increasing airflow requirements through electronics\n     racks, and the limits of air distribution within the typical data center\n     installation, coolant-assisted cooling is being combined with\n     conventional air-cooling. FIGS. 2-6 illustrate one embodiment of a data\n     center implementation employing a coolant-assisted cooling system with\n     one or more cold plates coupled to high heat-generating electronic\n     components disposed within the electronics racks.\n[0043] FIG. 2 depicts one embodiment of a partially coolant-cooled\n     electronics rack 200. As illustrated, coolant-cooled electronics rack 200\n     comprises a plurality of electronic subsystems 210, which may be\n     processor or server nodes. A bulk power regulator 220 is shown disposed\n     at an upper portion of liquid-cooled electronics rack 200, and two\n     coolant conditioning units (CCUs) 230 are disposed in a lower portion of\n     the liquid-cooled electronics rack. In certain embodiments described\n     below, the coolant is assumed to be water or an aqueous-based solution\n     (by way of example only).\n[0044] In addition to CCUs 230, the cooling system includes a system water\n     supply manifold 231, a system water return manifold 232, and\n     manifold-to-node fluid connect hoses 233 coupling system water supply\n     manifold 231 to electronic subsystems 210, and node-to-manifold fluid\n     connect hoses 234 coupling the individual electronic subsystems 210 to\n     system water return manifold 232. Each CCU 230 is in fluid communication\n     with system water supply manifold 231 via a respective system water\n     supply hose 235, and each CCU 230 is in fluid communication with system\n     water return manifold 232 via a respective system water return hose 236.\n[0045] As illustrated, a portion of the heat load of the electronic\n     subsystems is transferred from the system water to cooler facility water\n     supplied by facility water supply line 240 and facility water return line\n     241 disposed, in the illustrated embodiment, in the space between a\n     raised floor 201 and a base floor 202.\n[0046] FIG. 3 schematically illustrates operation of the cooling system of\n     FIG. 2, wherein a liquid-cooled cold plate 300 is shown coupled to an\n     electronic module 301 of an electronic subsystem 210 within the\n     liquid-cooled electronics rack 200. Heat is removed from electronic\n     module 301 via system coolant circulated via pump 320 through cold plate\n     300 within the system coolant loop defined by liquid-to-liquid heat\n     exchanger 321 of coolant conditioning unit 230, lines 322, 323 and cold\n     plate 300. The system coolant loop and coolant conditioning unit are\n     designed to provide coolant of a controlled temperature and pressure, as\n     well as controlled chemistry and cleanliness to the electronic module(s).\n     Furthermore, the system coolant is physically separate from the less\n     controlled facility coolant in lines 240, 241, to which heat is\n     ultimately transferred.\n[0047] FIG. 4 depicts a more detailed embodiment of a coolant conditioning\n     unit 230. As shown in FIG. 4, coolant conditioning unit 230 includes a\n     first coolant loop wherein chilled, facility coolant is supplied 410 and\n     passes through a control valve 420 driven by a motor 425. Valve 420\n     determines an amount of facility coolant to be passed through heat\n     exchanger 321, with a portion of the facility coolant possibly being\n     returned directly via a bypass orifice 435. The coolant conditioning unit\n     further includes a second coolant loop with a reservoir tank 440 from\n     which system coolant is pumped, either by pump 450 or pump 451, into the\n     heat exchanger 321 for conditioning and output thereof, as cooled system\n     coolant to the electronics rack to be cooled. The cooled system coolant\n     is supplied to the system water supply manifold and returned from the\n     system water return manifold of the liquid-cooled electronics rack via\n     the system water supply hose 235 and system water return hose 236,\n     respectively.\n[0048] FIG. 5 depicts one embodiment of an electronic subsystem 513\n     component layout wherein one or more air moving devices 511 provide\n     forced air flow 515 to cool multiple components 512 within electronic\n     subsystem 513. Cool air is taken in through a front 531 and exhausted out\n     a back 533 of the drawer. The multiple components to be cooled include\n     multiple processor modules to which liquid-cooled cold plates 520 (of a\n     liquid-based cooling system) are coupled, as well as multiple arrays of\n     memory modules 530 (e.g., dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs)) and\n     multiple rows of memory support modules 532 (e.g., DIMM control modules)\n     to which air-cooled heat sinks are coupled. In the embodiment\n     illustrated, memory modules 530 and the memory support modules 532 are\n     partially arrayed near front 531 of electronic subsystem 513, and\n     partially arrayed near back 533 of electronic subsystem 513. Also, in the\n     embodiment of FIG. 5, memory modules 530 and the memory support modules\n     532 are cooled by air flow 515 across the electronic subsystem.\n[0049] The illustrated coolant-based cooling system further includes\n     multiple coolant-carrying tubes connected to and in fluid communication\n     with coolant-cooled cold plates 520. The coolant-carrying tubes comprise\n     sets of coolant-carrying tubes, with each set including (for example) a\n     coolant supply tube 540, a bridge tube 541 and a coolant return tube 542.\n     In this example, each set of tubes provides coolant to a series-connected\n     pair of cold plates 520 (coupled to a pair of processor modules). Coolant\n     flows into a first cold plate of each pair via the coolant supply tube\n     540 and from the first cold plate to a second cold plate of the pair via\n     bridge tube or line 541, which may or may not be thermally conductive.\n     From the second cold plate of the pair, coolant is returned through the\n     respective coolant return tube 542.\n[0050] FIG. 6 depicts in greater detail an alternate electronics drawer\n     layout comprising eight processor modules, each having a respective\n     coolant-cooled cold plate of a coolant-based cooling system coupled\n     thereto. The coolant-based cooling system is shown to further include\n     associated coolant-carrying tubes for facilitating passage of liquid\n     coolant through the coolant-cooled cold plates and a header subassembly\n     to facilitate distribution of coolant to and return of coolant from the\n     coolant-cooled cold plates. By way of specific example, the coolant\n     passing through the coolant-based cooling subsystem is chilled water.\n[0051] The depicted planar server assembly includes a multi-layer printed\n     circuit board to which memory DIMM sockets and various electronic\n     components to be cooled are attached both physically and electrically. In\n     the cooling system depicted, a supply header is provided to distribute\n     coolant from a single inlet to multiple parallel coolant flow paths and a\n     return header collects exhausted coolant from the multiple parallel\n     coolant flow paths into a single outlet. Each parallel coolant flow path\n     includes one or more cold plates in series flow arrangement to cool one\n     or more electronic components to which the cold plates are mechanically\n     and thermally coupled. The number of parallel paths and the number of\n     series-connected coolant-cooled cold plates depends, for example, on the\n     desired device temperature, available coolant temperature and coolant\n     flow rate, and the total heat load being dissipated from each electronic\n     component.\n[0052] More particularly, FIG. 6 depicts a partially assembled electronic\n     system 613 and an assembled coolant-based cooling system 615 coupled to\n     primary heat-generating components (e.g., including processor dies) to be\n     cooled. In this embodiment, the electronics system is configured for (or\n     as) an electronics drawer of an electronics rack, and includes, by way of\n     example, a support substrate or planar board 605, a plurality of memory\n     module sockets 610 (with the memory modules (e.g., dual in-line memory\n     modules) not shown), multiple rows of memory support modules 632 (each\n     having coupled thereto an air-cooled heat sink 634), and multiple\n     processor modules (not shown) disposed below the coolant-cooled cold\n     plates 620 of the coolant-based cooling system 615.\n[0053] In addition to coolant-cooled cold plates 620, coolant-based\n     cooling system 615 includes multiple coolant-carrying tubes, including\n     coolant supply tubes 640 and coolant return tubes 642 in fluid\n     communication with respective coolant-cooled cold plates 620. The\n     coolant-carrying tubes 640, 642 are also connected to a header (or\n     manifold) subassembly 650 which facilitates distribution of coolant to\n     the coolant supply tubes and return of coolant from the coolant return\n     tubes 642. In this embodiment, the air-cooled heat sinks 634 coupled to\n     memory support modules 632 closer to front 631 of electronics drawer 613\n     are shorter in height than the air-cooled heat sinks 634\' coupled to\n     memory support modules 632 near back 633 of electronics drawer 613. This\n     size difference is to accommodate the coolant-carrying tubes 640, 642\n     since, in this embodiment, the header subassembly 650 is at the front 631\n     of the electronics drawer and the multiple liquid-cooled cold plates 620\n     are in the middle of the drawer.\n[0054] Coolant-based cooling system 615 may comprise a pre-configured\n     structure which includes multiple (pre-assembled) coolant-cooled cold\n     plates 620 configured and disposed in spaced relation to engage\n     respective heat-generating electronic components. Each coolant-cooled\n     cold plate 620 includes, in this embodiment, a coolant inlet and a\n     coolant outlet, as well as an attachment subassembly (i.e., a cold\n     plate/load arm assembly). Each attachment subassembly is employed to\n     couple its respective coolant-cooled cold plate 620 to the associated\n     electronic component to form the cold plate and electronic component\n     assemblies. Alignment openings (i.e., thru-holes) are provided on the\n     sides of the cold plate to receive alignment pins or positioning dowels\n     during the assembly process. Additionally, connectors (or guide pins) are\n     included within the attachment subassembly, which facilitate use of the\n     attachment assembly.\n[0055] As shown in FIG. 6, header subassembly 650 includes two manifolds,\n     i.e., a coolant supply header 652 and a coolant return header 654, which\n     in one embodiment, are coupled together via supporting brackets. In one\n     approach, the coolant supply header 652 may be metallurgically bonded in\n     fluid communication to each coolant supply tube 640, and the coolant\n     return header 654 may be metallurgically bonded in fluid communication to\n     each coolant return tube 642. In another approach, coupling assemblies\n     such as disclosed herein may be used to connect the illustrated tubes and\n     headers. A single coolant inlet 651 and a single coolant outlet 653\n     extend from the header subassembly for coupling to the electronics rack\'s\n     coolant supply and return manifolds (not shown).\n[0056] FIG. 6 also depicts one embodiment of coolant-carrying tubes. In\n     addition to coolant supply tubes 640 and coolant return tubes 642, bridge\n     tubes or lines 641 may be provided for coupling, for example, a coolant\n     outlet of one coolant-cooled cold plate to the coolant inlet of another\n     coolant-cooled cold plate to connect in series fluid flow the cold\n     plates, with the pair of cold plates receiving and returning coolant via\n     a respective set of coolant supply and return tubes. In one embodiment,\n     the coolant supply tubes 640, bridge tubes 641 and coolant return tubes\n     642 are each pre-configured, semi-rigid tubes formed of a thermally\n     conductive material, such as copper or aluminum, and the tubes are\n     coupled in a fluid-tight manner to the header subassembly and/or the\n     liquid-cooled cold plates. The tubes are pre-configured for a particular\n     electronics system to facilitate installation of the monolithic structure\n     in engaging relation with the electronics system.\n[0057] The above-described cooling approaches of FIGS. 2-6 present\n     effective solutions for circulating water through coolant-cooled cold\n     plates attached to heat-generating circuit modules (or components). An\n     example of the efficacy of this approach is the IBM Power 575\' system\n     offered by International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, N.Y. In\n     the embodiment of FIGS. 2-6, one or more coolant conditioning units\n     containing a pump and, for example, a water-to-water heat exchanger, may\n     be disposed within each electronics rack. As explained above, heat load\n     carried by the system coolant circulating through the coolant-cooled\n     components in the coolant-cooled electronics rack is rejected to facility\n     chilled water passing through the second coolant path through the active\n     water-to-water heat exchangers within the coolant conditioning units\n     disposed within the rack units.\n[0058] Field-replacability of cooling system components can be facilitated\n     by providing cooling subassemblies that employ, for example, flexible or\n     semi-flexible tubing interconnecting the coolant-cooled cold plates. One\n     approach to such a subassembly 700 is depicted in FIG. 7A, wherein\n     multiple cooled electronic assemblies 710 are depicted interconnected in\n     fluid communication. In this approach, flexibility in the interconnect\n     tubing allows for a particular coolant-cooled cold plate 701 to be\n     decoupled at its interface with an electronic module 702 resident on, in\n     this example, a substrate 704. Decoupling is facilitated by providing a\n     thermal interface material 703, which allows for subsequent reworking of\n     the cooled electronic assembly 710. By way of example, commonly assigned\n     U.S. Letters Pat. No. 7,420,808 B2, depicts cooling subassemblies which\n     comprise multiple cooled electronic assemblies, such as schematically\n     depicted in FIG. 7A.\n[0059] FIG. 7B is a schematic of an alternate a cooling approach, wherein\n     a coolant-cooled electronic subsystem 720 is illustrated comprising a\n     coolant manifold structure 721 detachably coupled to a coolant-cooled\n     electronic module 722. In the depicted embodiment, one or more\n     coolant-carrying channels 725 are integrated within the coolant-cooled\n     electronic module (or integrated electronic module) 722, so as to reside\n     within the electronic module, for example, within an encapsulation of the\n     module, or within a module lid enclosing one or more electronic\n     components within the module. By way of example, the coolant-cooled\n     electronic module is illustrated on a substrate 724. In the depicted\n     embodiment, the coolant manifold structure 721 includes a coolant inlet\n     726 (which may comprise a coolant inlet manifold) and a coolant outlet\n     727 (which may comprise a coolant outlet manifold). Coolant inlet 726 and\n     coolant outlet 727 are configured and disposed to be in fluid\n     communication with the one or more coolant-carrying channels 725 of\n     coolant-cooled electronic module 722 when the coolant manifold structure\n     721 is detachably coupled to the electronic module.\n[0060] FIGS. 8A-8C illustrate an additional embodiment of a cooled\n     electronic assembly, in accordance with one or more aspects of the\n     present invention. In this embodiment, one or more coolant-carrying\n     channels are again integrated within the electronic module itself, for\n     example, within a liquid manifold configured as a module lid (or within\n     an encapsulant) in direct contact with one or more electronic components\n     (such as one or more integrated circuit die or chips), or may be formed\n     integral with the electronic component(s) so as to be disposed within the\n     resultant module.\n[0061] Referring collectively to FIGS. 8A-8C, cooled electronic assembly\n     800 is shown to include a coolant-cooled electronic module 810, residing\n     on a substrate 811, and a coolant manifold structure 820 detachably\n     coupled to coolant-cooled electronic module 810 via, for example,\n     multiple fasteners 830 at the corners of the electronic assembly 800.\n     Coolant-cooled electronic module 810 comprises one or more electronic\n     components within the module, as well as one or more coolant-carrying\n     channels, with multiple channels being employed in the embodiment of\n     FIGS. 8A-8C. The multiple channels have multiple heat exchanger inlets\n     812 and outlets 813 formed within module lid 814 of the coolant-cooled\n     electronic module 810. Detachable coolant manifold structure 820\n     comprises, in this example, a coolant inlet 821 and a coolant outlet 822,\n     which are designed (in one embodiment) as a coolant inlet manifold and\n     coolant outlet manifold, respectively. The coolant inlet and coolant\n     outlet of the manifold are configured and positioned to align over the\n     coolant inlets 812 and outlets 813 of the heat exchanger within the\n     coolant-cooled electronic module 810. Inner containment rings (or\n     O-rings) 823, 824, may be provided within coolant manifold structure 820\n     to facilitate a fluid-tight coupling of the coolant manifold structure\n     820 to the integrated electronic module 810 at the interface between the\n     manifold structure and module. Tubing 841, 842 couples to the coolant\n     manifold structure 820 in fluid communication with the coolant inlet\n     manifold and coolant outlet manifold to facilitate the flow of coolant\n     through the coolant-carrying channels of the coolant-cooled electronic\n     module 810.\n[0062] Field replacability of a cooled electronic assembly, or more\n     particularly, the coolant-cooled electronic module of such an assembly,\n     provides significant cost savings and convenience advantages compared\n     with, for example, shutting an electronic subsystem down, and returning\n     the subsystem to a manufacturer for replacement of a module. There are\n     multiple approaches to field replacability of an assembly or a\n     coolant-cooled electronic module such as described herein. An example is\n     described below with reference to FIGS. 9A & 9B.\n[0063] FIGS. 9A & 9B illustrate one approach to field replaceability in a\n     cooled electronic system where there are no fluid-valves coupling the\n     coolant manifold structures to the subsystem coolant loop. By way of\n     example, such a system may employ rigid or semi-rigid tubing coupling the\n     coolant manifold structures in substantially fixed positions within the\n     electronic system. This is illustrated in FIG. 9B, where multiple cooled\n     electronic assemblies 955 are shown in position in fluid communication\n     with a subsystem-level coolant inlet manifold 951 and a subsystem-level\n     coolant outlet manifold 952 (by way of example only). As illustrated in\n     this figure, one coolant-cooled electronic module 960 being decoupled\n     (for example, for field-replacing thereof) from its associated coolant\n     manifold structure 961.\n[0064] Referring to the exchange process of FIG. 9A, a coolant-cooled\n     electronic module may be replaced by shutting down the subsystem (or\n     board) with the electronic module to be replaced 900, and draining the\n     tubing of the subsystem (or board) coolant loop 910. Optionally, the\n     tubing of the subsystem coolant loop may be flushed with air to remove\n     the coolant. Thereafter, the module-to-coolant loop interface may be\n     broken 920 by detaching the coolant-cooled electronic module from its\n     associated coolant manifold structure (see FIG. 9B). The detached\n     coolant-cooled electronic module may then be replaced 930. By draining\n     the subsystem coolant loop prior to decoupling the coolant-cooled\n     electronic module from its coolant manifold structure, discharge of\n     coolant onto, for example, the associated electronic board or other\n     components of the electronic system or subsystem is reduced, or even\n     eliminated. A new coolant-cooled electronic module may then be connected\n     to the coolant manifold structure remaining coupled within the cooled\n     electronic subsystem, after which the subsystem coolant loop is refilled\n     to allow for operation of the cooled electronic system 940.\n[0065] In FIG. 9C, an alternate approach to field replaceability of a\n     cooled electronic system is depicted, wherein tubing is provided coupling\n     the coolant manifold structures to subsystem-level coolant inlet manifold\n     951 and subsystem-level coolant outlet manifold 952. As illustrated in\n     this figure, one coolant-cooled electronic module 960 and the associated\n     coolant manifold structure 961 are coupled together and may be readily\n     released to withdraw the subassembly from the associated conduits using,\n     for instance, coupling assemblies 970, such as described herein. In one\n     or more implementations, enhanced coupling assemblies or couplers may be\n     employed, for instance, in connection with one or more of the\n     liquid-cooled manifolds, manifold assemblies, cold plates, etc., of FIGS.\n     2-9C. Examples of these coupling assemblies are described below with\n     reference to FIGS. 10A-12E.\n[0066] Generally stated, disclosed herein are various coupling assemblies\n     or couplers for facilitating connecting first and second fluid-carrying\n     components. In one or more implementations, the coupling assembly may be\n     configured and/or used to couple a conduit (or tube) to, for instance, a\n     liquid manifold, such as one of the above-described coolant manifold\n     structures. For instance, the coupling assemblies described herein could\n     be used to couple a conduit or tube to coolant manifold structure 961 of\n     FIGS. 9B & 9C, by way of example. Note, however, that the coupling\n     assemblies disclosed herein may be employed in a variety of different\n     types of liquid manifolds (or liquid manifold assemblies), including\n     coolant manifold assemblies and non-coolant manifold assemblies. In the\n     embodiments disclosed herein, the coupling assemblies may be secured to,\n     or even integrated with, a first fluid-carrying component, such as the\n     liquid manifold, for instance, at one or both of a liquid inlet or outlet\n     to the liquid manifold. The coupling assemblies disclosed herein\n     advantageously may be used to releasably secure a conduit to the liquid\n     manifold with little torque, and without hinges or flanges.\n[0067] Apparatuses are presented herein which include a coupling assembly\n     facilitating connecting fluid-carrying components. The coupling assembly\n     includes, for instance: a socket fitting with a first opening and a\n     second opening in fluid communication through the socket fitting, the\n     first opening being sized to accommodate a portion of a first\n     fluid-carrying component therein, and the second opening being sized to\n     accommodate a portion of a second fluid-carrying component therein; a\n     sleeve, the sleeve encircling the socket fitting at least in part, and\n     being constrained but rotatable relative to the socket fitting, the\n     sleeve including a first locking feature; and a second locking feature\n     associated with one fluid-carrying component of the first and second\n     fluid-carrying components. The second locking features is positioned and\n     sized relative to the one fluid-carrying component to engage the first\n     locking feature when the one fluid-carrying component is inserted into a\n     respective opening of the first and second openings in the socket\n     fitting. Once engaged, rotating of the sleeve facilitates threadably\n     locking the first and second locking features together to secure the one\n     fluid-carrying component relative to the sleeve and the socket fitting.\n[0068] In one or more implementations, the first locking feature includes\n     first locking threads, and the second locking feature includes second\n     locking threads. For instance, the first locking threads could be\n     internal locking threads within the sleeve at an end of the sleeve,\n     through which the one fluid-carrying component is inserted. Also, the\n     coupling assembly may include an externally-threaded ring secured to the\n     one fluid-carrying component, with the externally-threaded ring including\n     the second locking threads. By way of example, the second locking threads\n     could be located on an outer surface of the threaded ring so as to\n     threadably engage the first locking threads when an end of the one\n     fluid-carrying component is inserted into the sleeve and socket fitting\n     assembly. In this manner, the coupling assembly may releasably seal the\n     one fluid-carrying component to the socket fitting. A fluid-tight seal\n     may be enhanced by providing at least one annular groove in a surface of\n     the socket fitting, with the at least one annular groove accommodating,\n     at least in part, at least one annular face seal. The at least one\n     annular face seal is positioned and sized to engage the\n     externally-threaded ring when the first and second locking threads are\n     threadably locked together to form the fluid-tight seal between the one\n     coolant-carrying component and the socket fitting. Alternatively, or\n     additionally, one or more internal annular grooves may be provided within\n     the socket fitting to accommodate, at least in part, one or more internal\n     annular seals. The one or more internal annular seals may engage the one\n     fluid-carrying component when the one fluid-carrying component is\n     inserted into the respective opening of the socket fitting to facilitate\n     forming the fluid-tight seal between the one fluid-carrying component and\n     the socket fitting.\n[0069] In one or more implementations, the sleeve may include a first end\n     and a second end, with the first end including a first sleeve opening\n     allowing the portion of the first fluid-carrying component to pass\n     therethrough to facilitate coupling the first fluid-carrying component to\n     the socket fitting through the first opening thereof, and the second end\n     may include a second sleeve opening allowing the portion of the second\n     fluid-carrying component to pass therethrough to facilitate coupling of\n     the second fluid-carrying component to the socket fitting through the\n     second opening thereof.\n[0070] In certain embodiments, the coupling assembly may include a\n     spring-biasing mechanism disposed internally between, for instance, the\n     first end of the sleeve and the socket fitting, with such a\n     spring-biasing mechanism biasing the socket fitting away from the first\n     end of the sleeve.\n[0071] In one or more embodiments, the first locking feature includes at\n     least one groove in the sleeve adjacent to, for instance, the second end\n     thereof, and the second locking feature may include at least one\n     protrusion sized to extend into the at least one groove with coupling of\n     the one fluid-carrying component to the socket fitting. For instance, the\n     one fluid-carrying component may be the second fluid-carrying component,\n     and the spring-biasing mechanism may force the at least one protrusion\n     within the at least one groove against the sleeve when the second\n     fluid-carrying component is coupled to the socket fitting. In this\n     configuration, the at least one groove and at least one protrusion may\n     cooperate to define a partial-turn locking of the fluid-carrying\n     component to the sleeve, and thus, to the socket fitting to which the\n     sleeve is constrained. In one implementation, multiple grooves and\n     multiple protrusions, such as pins, may be provided to define, for\n     instance, a quarter-turn locking of the fluid-carrying component and\n     sleeve. In such implementations, the coupling assembly may include a ring\n     secured to the fluid-carrying component, with the ring having the\n     multiple pins extending therefrom, which are sized to extend into the\n     multiple grooves in the sleeve.\n[0072] As noted, the coupling assemblies disclosed herein may facilitate\n     connecting a variety of first and second fluid-carrying components. For\n     instance, in certain implementations, at least a portion of the coupling\n     assembly may be secured to or formed integral with a liquid-carrying\n     manifold or other liquid housing to facilitate, for instance, fluid-tight\n     sealing of a conduit to the liquid-carrying manifold in a releaseable\n     manner to facilitate replacement of the liquid-carrying manifold, or one\n     or more electronic components associated therewith, such as described\n     above. Advantageously, integrating or using a coupling assembly with a\n     liquid-cooled assembly such as discussed herein allows for the separate\n     removal of one of the liquid-cooled modules from the larger liquid-cooled\n     assembly, such as might be employed in one of the electronic subsystem\n     layouts described above.\n[0073] Referring collectively to FIGS. 10A-10F, one embodiment of an\n     apparatus 1000 is depicted comprising a coupling assembly 1001\n     facilitating connecting a first fluid-carrying component 1002 and a\n     second fluid-carrying component 1003. As shown, in this example,\n     apparatus 1000 includes a socket-side assembly 1010, and a plug-side\n     assembly 1030, with the apparatus illustrated disconnected in FIG. 10A,\n     and connected in FIG. 10E. By way of example only, the first and second\n     fluid-carrying components are depicted in these figures as separate\n     liquid conduits. Note that although illustrated in FIGS. 10A-10F as\n     separate tubes or conduits, one or both of the fluid-carrying components\n     1002, 1003, could comprise a portion of any liquid-carrying assembly,\n     such as a portion of a liquid-carrying manifold of a cooling assembly. By\n     way of example, first fluid-carrying component 1002 could comprise a\n     liquid inlet tube or a liquid outlet tube of a liquid-carrying assembly.\n[0074] As illustrated in FIGS. 10B-10D, in one embodiment, socket-side\n     assembly 1010 includes, in addition to a portion of first fluid-carrying\n     component 1002, a socket fitting 1020 and sleeve 1012. As depicted,\n     sleeve 1012 includes a first end 1013 and a second end 1014, each with a\n     respective opening 1015, 1016, through which a portion 1004, 1005 of the\n     respective first and second fluid-carrying components 1002, 1003 may be\n     inserted into socket fitting 1020. Sleeve 1012 is shown to, at least in\n     part, encircle socket fitting 1020, and is rotatable relative to the\n     socket fitting 1020 and partially constrained by the fitting. Sleeve 1012\n     includes a first locking feature, such as first locking threads 1017,\n     adjacent to second end 1014 of sleeve 1012. As shown, in one or more\n     implementations, first locking threads 1017 are internal locking threads,\n     provided on an inner surface of sleeve 1012. As illustrated in FIGS. 10B\n     & 10D, portion 1004 of first fluid-carrying component 1002 at an end 1006\n     thereof is inserted into the coupling assembly, and in particular, into\n     socket fitting 1020 and sleeve 1012 contacting, for instance, a stop 1021\n     formed as an annular land within socket fitting 1020. In one or more\n     implementations, first fluid-carrying component 1002 may be soldered,\n     brazed, welded, or otherwise permanently secured and sealed to socket\n     fitting 1020, in a manner as to still allow for rotation of sleeve 1012\n     relative to socket fitting 1020. Alternatively, socket fitting 1020 and\n     first fluid-carrying component 1002 could be integrated as a unitary\n     structure with, for instance, sleeve 1012 at one end and a connecting\n     element, such as one or more hose barbs or NPT threads, at the other end.\n[0075] As illustrated in FIG. 10C, socket fitting 1020 includes, in one\n     embodiment, a first opening 1026 and a second opening 1027 in fluid\n     communication through socket fitting 1020. Stop 1021 may be, as noted, an\n     annular land extending from an inner surface of socket fitting 1020.\n     Additionally, in one or more implementations, the inner surface of socket\n     fitting 1020 may include one or more internal annular grooves 1022, each\n     of which may be sized to accommodate, in part, a respective internal\n     annular seal 1023, such as a respective O-ring seal. The axial length of\n     socket fitting 1020 is chosen to be sufficient to accommodate receiving\n     the portion 1004 of first fluid-carrying component 1002 therein, as well\n     as a portion 1005 of second fluid-carrying component 1003, as illustrated\n     in FIGS. 10D & 10F. As shown, portion 1005 of second fluid-carrying\n     component 1003 is defined at an end 1007 of second fluid-carrying\n     component 1003 to be inserted into socket-side assembly 1010, and in\n     particular, into second opening 1027 (FIG. 10C) in socket fitting 1020.\n[0076] Plug-side assembly 1030 is shown to further include, in the\n     depicted embodiment, a threaded ring 1035, which includes the second\n     locking threads 1036 on, for instance, an exterior surface or outer\n     circumference thereof. The second locking threads 1036 are positioned and\n     sized, along with portion 1005 of second fluid-carrying compartment 1003,\n     to allow second locking threads 1036 to threadably engage first locking\n     threads 1017 on the inside of sleeve 1012 with insertion of end 1007 into\n     socket fitting 1020. In one or more implementations, second\n     fluid-carrying component 1003 may be a metal conduit or tube, such as a\n     copper tube, and threaded ring 1035 may be formed of metal as well. In\n     such an implementation, threaded ring 1035 may be brazed, welded, or\n     otherwise sealed, to second fluid-carrying component 1003. In one or more\n     other embodiments, second fluid-carrying component 1003 may be formed of\n     a non-metal, such as a plastic, and threaded ring 1035 may be otherwise\n     sealed to second fluid-carrying component 1003. For instance, second\n     fluid-carrying component 1003 and threaded ring 1035 may be molded\n     together or otherwise integrated as a unitary structure to have the\n     depicted plug-side assembly configuration. Also, note that the unitary\n     structure could alternatively be formed out of metal.\n[0077] As noted, FIGS. 10E & 10F depict apparatus 1000, with the plug-side\n     assembly 1030 coupled to the socket-side assembly 1010. When connected, a\n     fluid-tight seal is formed by, in part, one or more internal annular\n     seals 1023 compressing against the portion 1005 of second fluid-carrying\n     component 1003 inserted into socket fitting 1020. During the insertion,\n     the first and second locking threads engage, and sleeve 1012 is rotated\n     to threadably lock the plug-side assembly and socket-side assembly\n     together. Since this locking is threadably achieved, the plug-side\n     assembly and socket-side assembly may be subsequently released if\n     desired, for instance, for repair or replacement of one or more\n     associated structures. Also, note with reference to FIG. 10F, that in one\n     embodiment, an end surface 1025 of socket fitting 1020 may function as a\n     stop to the connecting of the plug-side assembly 1030 to the socket-side\n     assembly 1010 by, for instance, contacting a side of threaded ring 1035\n     as the assemblies are threadably coupled. Alternatively, in one or more\n     other implementations, annular land or stop 1021 could function as a stop\n     for component 1003 by contacting end 1006 of second fluid-carrying\n     component 1003 as it is threaded into the socket fitting.\n[0078] As one detailed example of the apparatus of FIGS. 10A-10F, one or\n     both of the fluid-carrying components 1002, 1003 may each comprise, for\n     instance, metal tubing (such as copper tubing) or non-metal tubing (such\n     as rigid or semi-rigid plastic tubing). In this configuration, the\n     plug-side assembly represents that portion of the apparatus that is\n     inserted into the socket-side assembly upon connection. In one or more\n     embodiments, the plug-side assembly has a metal ring of a finite\n     thickness, for instance, 5 mm or greater, that is, for instance, secured\n     to the fluid-carrying component a prescribed distance from the end of the\n     component. The outer diameter of the ring may have standard machine\n     threading. The socket-side assembly may include a copper or brass socket\n     fitting that is, for instance, brazed to the first fluid-carrying\n     component (in one example only). The side of the socket fitting opposite\n     to that accepting the brazed structure has a cylindrical cavity for\n     accepting the plug-side assembly, and one or more internal annular\n     grooves and annular seals, for a fluid-tight connection. The threaded\n     sleeve fits over the socket fitting and is axially-constrained at one end\n     by the fitting, but free to rotate relative to the socket fitting. The\n     open end in the sleeve has internal threads that mate with the external\n     threads on the plug-side assembly ring. Upon connection, the socket-side\n     sleeve is threaded onto the plug-side ring, locking the fluid components\n     together. Note that while in this example the sleeve is depicted as a\n     smooth cylinder, it could (by design) have features such as flat regions,\n     knurled surfaces, etc., to facilitate the threaded locking process.\n[0079] FIGS. 11A-11E depict another embodiment of an apparatus 1100\n     comprising a coupling assembly, in accordance with one or more aspects of\n     the present invention. Referring collectively to FIGS. 11A-11E, coupling\n     assembly 1101 is shown to facilitate connecting a first fluid-carrying\n     component 1102 and a second fluid-carrying component 1103. Apparatus 1100\n     again includes a socket-side assembly 1110, and a plug-side assembly\n     1130, with the apparatus shown disconnected in FIG. 11A, and connected in\n     FIG. 11D. As with the above-discussed embodiments, although illustrated\n     in FIGS. 11A-11E as separate conduits, one or both of fluid-carrying\n     components 1102, 1103 could comprise a portion of any liquid-carrying\n     assembly, such as a portion of a liquid-carrying manifold or cold plate\n     of a cooling assembly. By way of example, first fluid-carrying component\n     1102 could be a liquid inlet tube or a liquid outlet tube of a liquid\n     manifold assembly of a cooling system such as described above.\n[0080] FIGS. 11B & 11C illustrate one detailed embodiment of socket-side\n     assembly 1110. As depicted, socket-side assembly 1110 includes, in\n     addition to a portion of first fluid-carrying component 1102, a socket\n     fitting 1120, internal annular seals 1123, a spring-biasing mechanism\n     1129, and a sleeve 1112. Sleeve 1112 includes a first end 1113 and a\n     second end 1114, each with a respective opening, with opening 1116 at\n     second end 1114 being depicted in FIG. 11B. As explained above, a portion\n     1104, 1105 of the first and second fluid-carrying components 1102, 1103,\n     may be inserted into the socket fitting 1120 through the respective\n     sleeve openings. Sleeve 1112 is shown to, at least in part, encircle\n     socket fitting 1120, and is rotatable relative to socket fitting 1120,\n     and partially constrained by the fitting, as in the example explained\n     above in connection with FIGS. 10A-10F. Sleeve 1120 also includes a first\n     locking feature, such as at least one groove 1117 adjacent to second end\n     1114 of sleeve 1112. As shown, in one or more implementations, the at\n     least one groove 1117 comprises, by way of example, two quarter-turn\n     locking grooves which receive respective protrusions or pins associated\n     with the second fluid-carrying component 1103, as explained below.\n[0081] As depicted in FIGS. 11B & 11E, a portion 1104 of first\n     fluid-carrying component 1102 at an end 1106 thereof is inserted into the\n     coupling assembly, and in particular, into socket fitting 1120 and sleeve\n     1112 contacting, for instance, a stop 1121 formed as an annular land\n     within socket fitting 1120. In one or more implementations, first\n     fluid-carrying component 1102 may be soldered, brazed, welded, or\n     otherwise permanently secured and sealed to socket fitting 1120 in a\n     manner so as to still allow for rotation of sleeve 1112 relative to\n     socket fitting 1120. As shown in FIG. 11E, spring-biasing mechanism 1129\n     is disposed internally between the first end 1113 of sleeve 1112 and\n     socket fitting 1120. Spring-biasing mechanism 1129 is provided, in one or\n     more implementations, to bias the socket fitting 1120 away from first end\n     1113 of sleeve 1112. This, in turn, forces the one or more protrusions or\n     pins 1136 associated with second fluid-carrying component 1103 against\n     sleeve 1112 to more securely hold the pins in position. As illustrated in\n     FIG. 11B, the respective grooves 1117 in sleeve 1120 may include an\n     L-shaped terminus at which the protrusion resides when locked in place.\n     This requires a purposeful action to unlock the connection.\n[0082] As illustrated in FIG. 11C, socket fitting 1120 includes, in one\n     embodiment, a first opening 1126 and a second opening 1127 in fluid\n     communication through socket fitting 1120. Stop 1121 may be, as noted, an\n     annular land extending from an inner surface of socket fitting 1120.\n     Additionally, in one or more implementations, the inner surface of socket\n     fitting 1120 may include one or more internal annular grooves 1122, each\n     of which may be sized to accommodate, in part, a respective internal\n     annular seal 1123 (FIG. 11B), such as a respective O-ring seal. The axial\n     length of socket fitting 1120 may be chosen to be sufficient to\n     accommodate receiving the portion 1104 of first fluid-carrying component\n     1102 therein, as well as a portion 1105 of second fluid-carrying\n     component 1103 at an end 1107 of second fluid-carrying component 1103 to\n     be inserted into socket-side assembly 1110.\n[0083] Plug-side assembly 1130 is shown to further include, in the\n     depicted embodiment, a ring 1135, which includes one or more protrusions\n     1136 on, for instance, an exterior surface or outer circumference\n     thereof. The one or more protrusions, such as multiple pins, are\n     positioned and sized, along with portion 1105 of second fluid-carrying\n     compartment 1103, to allow the protrusions 1136 to insert into the one or\n     more grooves 1117 at second end 1114 of sleeve 1112 with insertion of end\n     1107 into socket fitting 1120. This allows for a simple, quarter-turn\n     action to lock and unlock the plug-side assembly 1130 from the\n     socket-side assembly 1110. The spring-biasing mechanism 1129\n     advantageously maintains the protrusions within the recessed groove at\n     the terminus of the groove(s) 1117 in the rotatable sleeve 1112.\n[0084] In one or more implementations, second fluid-carrying component\n     1103 may again be a metal conduit or tube, such as a copper tube, and\n     ring 1135 may be formed of metal as well. In such an implementation, ring\n     1135 may be brazed, welded, or otherwise sealed, to second fluid-carrying\n     component 1103. In other embodiments, second fluid-carrying component\n     1103 may be formed of a non-metal, such as a plastic, and ring 1135 may\n     be otherwise sealed to second fluid-carrying component 1103. For\n     instance, ring 1135 having protrusions 1136 and second fluid-carrying\n     component 1103 may be molded together as a unitary structure to have the\n     depicted plug-side assembly configuration.\n[0085] As noted, FIGS. 11D & 11E depict apparatus 1100, with plug-side\n     assembly 1130 coupled to socket-side assembly 1110. When connected, a\n     fluid-tight seal is formed by, in part, one or more internal annular\n     seals 1123 compressing against the portion 1105 of second fluid-carrying\n     component 1103 inserted into socket fitting 1120. During the insertion,\n     protrusions 1136 are aligned to grooves 1117 in sleeve 1112 and pressed\n     into the grooves, compressing spring-biasing mechanism 1129. In the\n     example illustrated, a quarter-turn rotation of sleeve 1112 positions\n     protrusions 1136 in the respective receiving recesses at the ends of the\n     grooves. As noted, spring-biasing mechanism 1129 maintains the\n     protrusions 1136 in the locked position within the respective receiving\n     grooves until positive force is applied to disconnect the coupling\n     assembly.\n[0086] FIGS. 12A-12E depict still another embodiment of an apparatus 1200\n     comprising a coupling assembly, in accordance with one or more aspects of\n     the present invention. Referring collectively to FIGS. 12A-12E, apparatus\n     1200 is shown to include coupling assembly 1201 which facilitates\n     connecting a first fluid-carrying component 1202 and a second\n     fluid-carrying component 1203. The apparatus is again shown to include a\n     socket-side assembly 1210, and a plug-side assembly 1230, with the\n     apparatus illustrated disconnected in FIG. 12A, and connected in FIG.\n     12E. As in the embodiments described above, the fluid-carrying components\n     1202, 1203 are illustrated as tubes or conduits, by way of example only.\n     In other embodiments, one or more of the tubes could comprise a portion\n     of any liquid-carrying assembly, such as a portion of a liquid-carrying\n     manifold of a cooling assembly. By way of example, first fluid-carrying\n     component 1202 could comprise a liquid inlet tube or a liquid outlet tube\n     of a liquid-carrying manifold, such as described above.\n[0087] FIGS. 12B & 12C depict one embodiment of socket-side assembly 1210.\n     As illustrated, socket-side assembly 1210 includes, in addition to a\n     portion of first fluid-carrying component 1202, a socket fitting 1220 and\n     a sleeve 1212. In one or more embodiments, sleeve 1212 includes a first\n     end 1213 and a second end 1214, each with a respective opening through\n     which a portion of the respective first and second fluid-carrying\n     components may be inserted into socket fitting 1220. Sleeve 1212 is shown\n     to, at least in part, encircle socket fitting 1220, and is rotatable\n     relative to socket fitting 1220, and partially constrained by the fitting\n     when assembled, as depicted in FIGS. 12D & 12E.\n[0088] In one or more implementations, sleeve 1212 includes a first\n     locking feature, such as first locking threads 1217 located adjacent to\n     opening 1216 at second end 1214 of sleeve 1212. In one or more\n     embodiments, first locking threads 1217 are internal locking threads\n     provided on an inner surface of sleeve 1212. As illustrated in FIG. 12E,\n     a portion of first fluid-carrying component 1202 at an end thereof is\n     inserted into the coupling assembly, and in particular, into socket\n     fitting 1220 and sleeve 1212 contacting, for instance, a stop 1221 formed\n     as an annular land within socket fitting 1220. In one or more\n     implementations, first fluid-carrying component 1202 may be soldered,\n     brazed, welded, or otherwise permanently secured and sealed to socket\n     fitting 1220 in a manner so as to still allow for rotation of sleeve 1212\n     relative to socket fitting 1220.\n[0089] As illustrated in FIG. 12C, socket fitting 1220 includes, in one\n     embodiment, a first opening 1226 and a second opening 1227 in fluid\n     communication through socket fitting 1220. Stop 1221 may be, as noted, an\n     annular land extending from an inner surface of socket fitting 1220.\n     Additionally, in one or more implementations, the inner surface of socket\n     fitting 1220 may include one or more internal annular grooves 1222, each\n     of which may be sized to accommodate, in part, a respective internal\n     annular seal 1223 (FIG. 12B), such as a respective O-ring seal. Also, in\n     this embodiment, an end surface 1225 of socket fitting 1220 may include\n     at least one annular groove 1241 accommodating, in part, at least one\n     annular face seal 1240 (FIG. 12B). As illustrated in FIG. 12E, when the\n     socket-side assembly and plug-side assembly are connected, the at least\n     one annular face seal 1240 engages a threaded ring 1235 associated with\n     second fluid-carrying component 1203 to facilitate forming a fluid-tight\n     seal between the second fluid-carrying component and the socket fitting.\n     Note that the axial length of socket fitting 1220 may be chosen to be\n     sufficient to accommodate receiving the respective portions of the first\n     and second fluid-carrying components 1202, 1203, as illustrated in FIGS.\n     12A-12E.\n[0090] As noted, plug-side assembly 1230 includes a threaded ring 1235,\n     which has second locking threads 1236 on, for instance, an exterior\n     surface or outer circumference thereof. Second locking threads 1236 are\n     positioned and sized to threadably engage first locking threads 1217 on\n     the inside of sleeve 1212 with insertion of second fluid-carrying\n     component 1203 into socket fitting 1220. In one or more implementations,\n     second fluid-carrying component 1203 may be a metal conduit or tube, such\n     as a copper tube, and threaded ring 1235 may be formed of metal as well.\n     In such implementations, threaded ring 1235 may be soldered, brazed,\n     welded, or otherwise sealed, to second fluid-carrying component 1203. As\n     with the embodiments noted above, in other implementations, second\n     fluid-carrying component 1203 may be formed of a non-metal, such as a\n     plastic, and threaded ring 1235 may be otherwise sealed to second\n     fluid-carrying component 1203. For instance, second fluid-carrying\n     component 1203 and threaded ring 1235 may be molded together as a unitary\n     structure to have the depicted plug-side assembly configuration.\n[0091] FIGS. 12D & 12E depict apparatus 1200, with plug-side assembly 1230\n     coupled to socket-side assembly 1210. When connected, a fluid-tight seal\n     is formed by, in part, the one or more internal annular seals 1223\n     compressing against second fluid-carrying component 1203 inserted into\n     socket fitting 1220, and the one or more annular face seals 1240\n     compressing against threaded ring 1235 when the first and second locking\n     threads are threadably locked. During insertion of the second\n     fluid-carrying component 1203 into socket fitting 1220, the first and\n     second locking threads engage, and sleeve 1220 is rotated to threadably\n     lock the plug-side assembly and socket-side assembly together. Since the\n     locking is threadably achieved, the plug-side assembly and socket-side\n     assembly may be subsequently released if desired, for instance, for\n     repair or replacement of one or more associated structures. Also, note\n     with reference to FIG. 12E, that in one embodiment, the end surface 1225\n     of socket fitting 1220 may function as a stop to the connecting of the\n     plug-side assembly 1230 to socket-side assembly 1210 by, for instance,\n     contacting the side of threaded ring 1235 as the assemblies are\n     threadably coupled. Alternatively, in one or more other implementations,\n     annular land or stop 1221 could function as a stop for second\n     fluid-carrying component 1203 by contacting the end of the component as\n     it coupled within the socket fitting. Note also, that in the embodiments\n     of FIGS. 12A-12E, the threaded ring 1235 has a larger diameter than the\n     threaded ring 1035 of the embodiment of FIGS. 10A-10F. This larger\n     diameter in part facilitates brazing of the threaded ring to the second\n     fluid-carrying component 1203, and thus, facilitates a strong braze joint\n     which is capable of withstanding the mechanical forces required to\n     properly make, for instance, the face seal disclosed herein.\n[0092] Those skilled in the art will note that variations on the\n     embodiments described above can accommodate rigid or semi-rigid plastic\n     tubing. For instance, the plug-side assembly ring and/or the socket\n     fitting could be made of a suitable plastic to effectively bond the\n     respective plastic tubing. Alternatively, the socket fitting could be\n     made to have a hose barb termination for joining the plastic or EPDM\n     tubing. Additionally, rather than attaching the plug ring directly to the\n     tube, the plug-side fitting could be made to properly mate and seal with\n     the socket-side assembly, and accept any tube or hose desired.\n[0093] The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing\n     particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the\n     invention. As used herein, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" are\n     intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly\n     indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms\n     "comprise" (and any form of comprise, such as "comprises" and\n     "comprising"), "have" (and any form of have, such as "has" and "having"),\n     "include" (and any form of include, such as "includes" and "including"),\n     and "contain" (and any form contain, such as "contains" and "containing")\n     are open-ended linking verbs. As a result, a method or device that\n     "comprises", "has", "includes" or "contains" one or more steps or\n     elements possesses those one or more steps or elements, but is not\n     limited to possessing only those one or more steps or elements. Likewise,\n     a step of a method or an element of a device that "comprises", "has",\n     "includes" or "contains" one or more features possesses those one or more\n     features, but is not limited to possessing only those one or more\n     features. Furthermore, a device or structure that is configured in a\n     certain way is configured in at least that way, but may also be\n     configured in ways that are not listed.\n[0094] The corresponding structures, materials, acts, and equivalents of\n     all means or step plus function elements in the claims below, if any, are\n     intended to include any structure, material, or act for performing the\n     function in combination with other claimed elements as specifically\n     claimed. The description of the present invention has been presented for\n     purposes of illustration and description, but is not intended to be\n     exhaustive or limited to the invention in the form disclosed. Many\n     modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill\n     in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.\n     The embodiment was chosen and described in order to best explain the\n     principles of one or more aspects of the invention and the practical\n     application, and to enable others of ordinary skill in the art to\n     understand one or more aspects of the invention for various embodiments\n     with various modifications as are suited to the particular use\n     contemplated.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',
