 'patent_description': u"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a disposable reamer shaft that may be attached to a modular disposable spherical or tapered hollow reamer, the disposable reamer shaft being concentrically attached to a modular hollow reamer to provide wobble\nfree rotation of the reamer tool.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  These procedures include hip replacement and shoulder replacement, and the like.  Reamers are used in procedures that involve creation of\nacetabular bone cavities that accept a properly sized acetabular cups.  Prior art reamers typically fall into two major classes: rigid and flexible shaft.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone cavity is achieved through utilization of a solid\nspherical reamer some having provisions for discharging and collecting reamed bone fragments.  Solid spherical reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally\ndenser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the acetabular cavity for a proper fit of the acetabular cup.  Conventional spherical reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses. \nOnce the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient friction/heat to damage or kill the surrounding bone.  These prior art solid spherical reamers are intended for multiple uses and\ntherefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  Dull blades also incorporate bone debris or bone cement debris into the living bone tissue, creating bone healing problems and fixation of an\nimplanted acetabular cup.\n U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,811,632, 5,100,267 and 5,299,893 to Salyer discloses a surgical reamer and a disposable acetabular reamer cup.  The first patent does not disclose a disposable shaft while the second and third patents does not assure the\nconcentricity of the cutting bowl with respect to that of the shaft.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,116,165 to Salyer discloses an acetabular reamer cup.  This '165 patent does not have a disposable shaft and the arrangement used has no direct connection between the shaft and the cutting howl other than through the base\naperture.  The concentricity of the cutting bowl with respect to that of the shaft is therefore not assured.\n U.S.  Pat.  No, 5,658,290 to Lechot discloses an assembly comprising reamer spindle and reamer for surgery.  The reamer comprises a cap and at least three radial rods which are arranged uniformly on the inside edge of the cap and join up\nintegrally at the center of the cap.  The reamer spindle comprises a shank on which there is fixed a reamer spindle head that is equipped with a bayonet with locking means for the securing of the reamer.  The securing catches of the bayonet are intended\nto receive the radial rods of the reamer.  The connection between the reamer rods and bayonet does not provide a precise centerline matching arrangement.  The shaft is not indicated to be disposable\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,709,688, as well as U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,001,105, and 6,428,543 to Salyer disclose an acetabular reamer cup and method of producing the same.  The bottom has a tool driver opening coaxial and is concentric with the cutting bowl. The driver opening engages with the shaft, which drives the acetabular reamer.  This form of attachment of the shaft with the acetabular reamer does not ensure alignment of axis of the shaft with that of the acetabular reamer.  The acetabular reamer or\nthe shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,755,719 to Frieze, et al. discloses an acetabular reamer.  This acetabular reamer includes a base, a first set of semi-circular blades attached to the base, and a second set of semi-circular blades also contacting said base,\nand crossing and intersecting with said first set of blades at right angles thereto.  The base preferably comprises a circular plate having a hexagonal drive hole in the center thereof and a plurality of slots in the periphery thereof for anchoring the\nblades.  The drive shaft is coupled to a hexagonal aperture in the base plate.  This method of attachment does not align the hemispherical cutter centerline with that of the drive shaft.  As such, the arrangement causes wobbliness of the cutter in the\nbone cavity.  The shaft of the acetabular reamer is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,976,144 to Fishbein et al. discloses a hollow dome reamer with removable teeth.  A drive shaft is connected to the base plate through an aperture in the base plate and held in place by a spring.  There is no direct attachment\nof the shaft to the dome and this multitude of connections to the shaft does not assure that the centerline of the shaft coincides with that of the hollow dome.  The shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,980,170 to Salyer as well as U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,817,096, 5,501,686, 5,282,804, 5,236,433, 5,171,313, 5,171,312 disclose a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is\nsecured at one of said shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool collate is secured at the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be\npositioned.  The boss has a distal end surface with a groove therein.  Both the groove and the distal end surface extend transversely of the axis.  A pin is positioned in the groove on the axis.  A latch mechanism is provided to hold a mounting bar of a\nrotary tool in the groove on the pin, whereby the rotary tool is held exactly coaxially of the driver during use.  The rotary tool, which is used with the driver has a bar which has the same dimensions as the groove in the boss of the tool driver of the\ninvention.  The bar thus fills the slot and is complementary to the slot.  The bar has a hole therein which is complementary to the pin.  The pin extends coaxially of the shaft and the boss.  The bar hole in which the pin of the tool driver is positioned\nis precisely coaxial of the axis of the tool about which the cutting edges are precisely positioned.  The tool driver has a shaft appointed to receive acetabular reamer cups and patella cutters.  The cutters are appointed to be connected to the by of the\nshaft by means of mounting bar in the cutter and a slot in the shaft secured by a complementary pin.  This method of attachment--using a mounting bar that slides into a slot--does not align the centerline of the shaft with that of the reamer.  Moreover,\nthe shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,168,600 to Grace, et al discloses an acetabular reamer backing plate and method of use.  The backing plate for an acetabular reamer assembly that has a planar surface allows for the attachment of a reamer driver.  This\nattachment feature only uses a single point attachment of the reamer to the shaft at the edge profile of the backing plate.  It is therefore subject to displacement of the shaft laterally, causing the centerlines of the shaft and reamer to be not\nprecisely aligned.  The shaft is not indicated to he disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,409,732 to Salyer discloses a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is secured at one of the shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool\ncollate is secured to the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be positioned.  The boss is equipped with a securing device of the bayonet type having a latch\nmechanism, which holds the rotary tool on the boss coaxially of the driver during use.  The securing device has a tapered bore extending from the distal end of the boss axially of the shaft.  The rotary tool has a diametrical bar extending across a\nbottom tool driver opening with a centrally located circular disk therein.  The disk of the rotary tool fits within the bore of the tool shaft boss so as to concentrically locate the rotary tool and the tool shaft on the same axis.  The latch mechanism\nholds the tool driver and the tool together in this position, whereby rotary tools of a multitude of sizes can be secured concentrically to the tool shaft without holding a plurality of critical tolerances when machining the bayonet type securing device\nor the rotary tool bottom bar.  The tool driver is a shaft with a slot on the end that receives the acetabular reamer.  It deals with the details of the device for attaching the acetabular reamer to the shaft.  This type of slotted attachment does not\nresult in coaxial mounting of the reamer that is coincident with the centerline of the shaft, even though the different components of the shaft are said to be coaxially aligned.  The reamer or the shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,875,217 to Wolford discloses an orthopedic reamer assembly.  This orthopedic reamer assembly includes a reamer with a generally hemispherical shell having a concave side and at least one attachment feature associated with the\nconcave side.  A driver is attachable to the reamer and has a shaft with a reamer end.  A releasable collar is disposed on the reamer end, which includes a boss having at least one retaining pin.  A sleeve is fitted over the boss and includes a groove\nthat is proximate to a corresponding retaining pin.  The reamer has a cavity in the reamer end with a biasing element.  The biasing element biases the sleeve in a closed position respective to the boss.  A release pin, which press fits into the sleeve is\nprovided in the reamer end, and is conveyed through the cavity, with the biasing element biasing against the release pin.  The orthopedic reamer assembly is a complicated attachment of design of the drive shaft to an acetabular reamer with multiple\nsliding parts.  Since each of the sliding parts requires a sliding fit, there are inherent displacement possibilities and therefore, the centerline of the shaft is not reliably aligned with the centerline of the acetabular reamer.  Moreover, the\nacetabular reamer or the shaft is not indicated to be disposable and requires complicated machined elements to enable a sliding fit.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0181916 to Wolford discloses an orthopedic reamer with flat cutting teeth.  This orthopedic reamer is for cutting bone and includes a shaft and a head coupled with the shaft.  The head includes a\ndistal face with a plurality of cutting teeth.  Each cutting tooth includes a hole extending through the head.  At least a portion of each hole has a substantially round perimeter.  A raised lip is positioned adjacent to and extends around at least part\nof the substantially round portion.  The '916 publication discloses an orthopedic reamer with flat cutting teeth having a shaft attached to acetabular reamer cups.  The reamer cups or the shaft of the '916 publication are not disposable in nature.  The\nattachment of the acetabular reamer to the drive shaft includes a complicated mechanism and does not reliably align the centerline of the drive shaft with that of the acetabular reamer.  As such, wobble free rotation is not provided.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0088757 to Tulkis discloses an acetabular reamer.  The reamer assembly includes a tool driver and a tool.  Tool driver comprises a shaft.  The tool receiving end of the shaft has a flange.  Formed in\nthe flange are four L-shaped bayonet catches, which receive the tool.  The tool has a body having slots.  A cutter can slidably fit into the slots.  When installed in the slots, the cutters project slightly above the body.  The projecting portions of the\ncutters form the cutting edges for shaving or cutting tissue.  The reamer is formed by attaching a tool to the tool driver by lowering it in the L-shaped bayonet catches.  The reamer can be coupled to a drive means such as a hand drill and inserted in a\nbody cavity.  Operating the reamer against body tissue shaves of body tissue.  This type of four L-shaped bayonet catches attaching a shaft to a reamer does not provide precise alignment of the centerline of the reamer and the shaft since it is a single\nlocation attachment and is subject to rotational movement.  The shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n Foreign Publication No. WO 9007908 to Schelhas discloses an acetabulum reamer.  Acetabulum reamer for reaming the acetabulum of the human pelvic bone prior to insertion of an artificial hip joint cup comprises a reamer head on a shaft and a\nspiral reaming ridge arranged about the axis of the shaft and provided with reaming devices.  The outer edge of the reaming ridge is delimited by a section of a spherical surface whose axis of rotation is flush with the axis of the shaft.  The acetabulum\nreamer utilizes a spherical head for reaming a socket in an acetabulum.  The spherical shape of the multiple use reamer provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the bone joints.  Significantly, the acetabulum reamer publication does not\nteach a disposable spherical hollow surgical reamer tool that is attached to a drive shaft with coincident centerlines.\n A number of prior art patents disclose use of polymeric shaft for delivering rotational torque.  These polymeric shafts generally are tubular in construction with glass fibers or carbon fibers embedded in the polymer matrix.  However, these\npolymeric shafts are rather large in diameter and short in overall length and generally unsuited for reamer shafts, which are required to be small in diameter and long in length.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,171,626 to Yates, et al. discloses a carbon fiber reinforced composite drive shaft.  A carbon fiber reinforced composite tubular drive shaft has a plurality of bonded circumferentially disposed layers of fibrous reinforcement\nsituated within an epoxy resinous matrix material.  The innermost layer has glass fibers disposed at +30.degree.  to +50.degree.  to the longitudinal axis of the shaft.  The outermost layer has glass fibers disposed at +60.degree.  to 90.degree.  to the\nlongitudinal axis of said shaft.  An intermediate layer has glass fibers disposed at 0.degree.  to +15.degree.  to the longitudinal axis of said shaft.  An intermediate layer has carbon fibers disposed at 0.degree.  to +15.degree.  to the longitudinal\naxis of said shaft.  The light weight composite drive shaft is resists torsion budding to without deleteriously influencing the critical speed of the drive shaft.  The drive shaft is not indicated to be for use in attaching hollow reamers.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,248,062 to McLain, et al. discloses a drive shaft assembly and method for making same.  A composite drive shaft having a hollow tubular, multi-layered fiber reinforced plastic shaft portion with a metallic sleeve inserted in\nand bonded thereto at least at one end, said sleeve having a universal joint connector.  The tubular, fiber-reinforced plastic shaft has layers of oppositely angled resin-impregnated helical fibers at 25.degree.  to 65.degree.  to the longitudinal shaft\naxis and at least one layer of longitudinal fibers forming a laminate and a metallic sleeve is received within at one end and longitudinal fibers provides flexural rigidity to the laminate and oppositely angled layers provide torsional strength and inner\nspiral layer provides additional hoop strength to the laminate.  This drive shaft assembly has a universal joint and does not connect to a hollow reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,259,382 to Schwan discloses fiber reinforced composite shaft with metal connector sleeves secured by adhesive.  The tubular fiber reinforced composite shaft comprises a shaft body formed of a plurality of integrally bonded\ncircumferential plies of solidified fiber reinforced resinous material.  A metal sleeve is mounted in at least one end of the shaft body.  A layer of adhesive material is disposed between an outer surface of the metal sleeve and an inner surface of the\nshaft body to bond the sleeve to the body.  This composite shaft assembly with adhesively bonded is not indicated to connect to a hollow reamer.\n There remains a need in the art for a modular easy-to-assemble spherical or tapered hollow reamer for medical applications having a disposable reamer shaft.  Also needed in the art is a disposable spherical hollow or tapered cutter assembly,\nwhich can be attached concentric to a reusable shaft portion that provides means for reaming of a bone cavity without wobbly movement.  Further needed in the art is a cutter assembly having means for collecting bone debris and keeping the collected\ndebris displaced from the cutting portion, so that heat generated at the bone cutting surface is minimized.  Still further needed in the art is a disposable shaft for a spherical hollow or tapered reamer assembly wherein, after one use of the spherical\nor tapered hollow reamer, a clean contamination-free replacement shaft is provided.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a disposable shaft for reamers.  Reamer shafts are long with a shaft length in the range of 250 to 400 millimeters.  These shafts have a small shaft diameter typically in the range of 4 to 14 millimeters,\npreferably 5 millimeters for hollow tattered reamers and 14 mm for spherical hollow reamers.  The shaft must have certain features for the concentric attachment of the disposable shaft with a disposable modular hollow reamer.  Moreover, the other side of\nthe disposable shaft requires certain features for attachment to a drill or suitable drive drain.  Machining such small-diameter long-length shafts with precision is generally difficult and time consuming; this results in reamer shaft cost that is well\nover thousand dollars.  The shafts may be rigid or flexible depending on the type and orientation of the bone cavity being surgically reamed.  The reamer shaft may be solid or cannulated, meaning that it has a central hole for inserting a guide pin.\n Precisely dimensioned rods as well as tubes are readily available in the market place.  Precision machining of small sized attachment pieces is readily carried out at a low manufacturing cost.  The present invention contemplates attaching these\nsmall sized attachment pieces to a standard commercially available precision rods and tubes using gluing methods including use of epoxy glues in a fixture that creates precise alignment of the rod or tube shaft with the attachment pieces, one at each\nend.  The attachment features may be affixed with an aperture drilled within the rod or affixed over the outside diameter of the rod or tube.  Conveniently, the hole present within the tube may be used for affixing the attachment pieces.  The attachment\npieces are configured according to the attachment requirements of a specific modular reamer to which the disposable reamer shaft will be attached and may be a male threaded or female threaded screw attachment.  The other side of the rod or tube is glued\nto an attachment piece that is a chuck drive, J&J drive or other driver that connects to other drive mechanisms.\n Solid rigid shafts are made from precisely dimensioned rod stock of stainless steel or other suitable alloy or fiber reinforced plastic.  Cannulated shafts are made from precisely dimensioned tubular stock.  Flexible shafts solid or cannulated\nare made from Nitinol or fiber reinforced plastic.  The fiber reinforced plastic may have fiber wraps surrounding a polymeric rod or tube that circumferentially reinforced for transmitting torque.  The solid Nitinol shaft may be wire cut in a helical\npattern to provide a spring like structure providing the desired flexibility.  This wire cutting step may increase the reamer cost due to machining operation.  However, when the shaft is required to be rigid additional fiber reinforcement is provided\nalong the longitudinal length of the shaft to limit flexure.  The reinforcing fibers may be selected from carbon filaments, boron filaments, glass fibers, polyaramid fibers (Kenval.TM.), liquid crystal long chain polymer fibers (Spectra.TM.) or\ncombinations thereof.\n Specifically, the attachment between the disposable spherical or tapered hollow reamer and the disposable shaft is accomplished by a precision threaded screw attachment at one end and a support feature at a distance away from the first threaded\nattachment location.  This provides two attachment locations that are at a distance from each other providing precise rotational centerline alignment of the reamer shaft and the hollow reamer.  The disposable reamer shaft has at one end a corresponding\nmetallic fitting with precision threads adapted to connect to threads of the hollow reamer.\n The process for manufacturing the low cost disposable reamer shaft disposable spherical or tapered hollow reamer involves the following steps: 1.  selecting a rod stock or tube stock with a precise outer diameter in the range of 4 to 14\nmillimeters; 2.  cutting the rod or tube to required shaft length in the range of 250 to 400 millimeters for a disposable reamer shaft; 3.  providing rod or tube end configuration for receiving attachment pieces; 4.  machining attachment pieces with\nprecise threads for attachment to a modular hollow reamer on one side and attachment pieces for attachment to drive power unit on one end, both types of pieces provided with an appropriate geometry for attachment for ends of a rod or tube; and 5.  gluing\nwith epoxy using a fixture that aligns centerlines a tube or rod with a modular hollow reamer attachment piece on one end and a drive connecting attachment piece of the other end; wherein said low cost disposable reamer shaft is solid or flexible with or\nwithout cannulation is fabricated from stainless steel, reinforced plastic or Nitinol and is centerline matched to hollow reamer.

This preparation can be intended for either cementing an acetabular cup (preparation\nwould be oversized to the implant) or press fitting an acetabular cup (preparation undersized to the implant).  In either case, a spherically shaped cutter is used to machine the internal geometry of the acetabulum.  These spherical cutting tools are\nrequired to cut both cortical bone (hard bone) and cancellous bone (spongy bone) during normal surgery.  The spherical cutter is generally assembled to a drive shaft which is coupled to a power drill and this assembly is used to machine the acetabulum\nfor the implant.  These cutters are intended for multiple surgeries and are used many times for many patients.  The cutting action of these reamers is afforded by a plurality of cutting teeth.  Because these teeth encounter hard bone and they are used\nmultiple times, the cutters can become dull and inefficient in their cutting ability.  Two primary problems exist with this type of instrument and surgical method:\n 1.  Since these spherical cutters are reused, special attention is needed in properly cleaning them prior to use in preparing the next patient's acetabulum.\n 2.  The cutting teeth can become dull even after one use and therefore do not cut bone efficiently.  In addition, this cutting inefficiency generates friction/heat which can damage or kill the surrounding bone.\n As these cutters become dull, they also do not cut an accurate preparation for implant either in size or spherical geometry.  Even initially, these cutters can be not accurately concentric which is further compounded by the wear and use of the\ncutter.  Although these cutters are intended for multiple uses, there are really not quality control measures which monitor their function and eventual need to be replaced.  There are not programs/qualified personnel in the hospitals that can inspect and\nevaluate the function and dimensional accuracy of the cutters after they have been used.  It would be beneficial for the patient and the hospital to be assured that the surgeon could always be supplied with a clean/sterile spherical cutter with accurate\nand sharp cutting teeth for every clinical case.\n Reaming of bone cavity is required during many orthopedic surgical procedures.  These procedures include hip replacement and shoulder replacement and the like.  Reaming of the bone cavities for the placement of an acetabular cup requires milling\nof precisely shaped bone cavity.  When the acetabular cup is fixed by interference, this precision is more critical than when the acetabular cup is bonded to the bone cavity by a cement composition.\n Generally stated, the disposable reamer shaft for disposable modular spherical or tapered hollow reamer for medical applications broadly comprises: (i) a disposable reamer shaft made from a rod or tube stock having precise outer diameter; (ii)\none end of said rod or tube stock glued with epoxy or other suitable glue to a hollow reamer attachment piece that has appropriate affixing features portion at one end and threaded connection at its other end for attachment to said hollow reamer; (iii)\nother end of said rod or tube stock glued with epoxy or other suitable glue to power drive attachment piece that has appropriate affixing features portion at one end and chuck connection features on its other end.\n The reamer shaft especially cannulated versions and flexible versions accumulate body fluids in the bent region as well as the cannulated central hole, which are impossible to clean contaminating the next patient when the reamer shaft is reused. The precision machining requirement of a long small diameter reamer shaft is very expensive resulting in reamer shaft cost in the range of several thousands of dollars.  Therefore, it is desirable to provide a low cost disposable reamer shaft combating\nthese contamination issues and reamer cost.\n The disposable reamer shaft must be provided on one end with attachment features suited for attachment to disposable modular spherical or tapered hollow reamers with a precise centerline attachment.  The other end of the disposable reamer shaft\nmust have attachment features to connect the reamer shaft to a power drive unit.  The disposable modular spherical hollow reamer disclosed in previously filed applications bearing U.S.  12/072,671 and U.S.  12/583,704 disclose two different geometries\nproviding support of the modular spherical hollow reamer at two locations displaced at a distance from each other assuring concentric attachment of the reamer to the centerline of the shaft.  The previously filed application bearing U.S.  11/973,260 and\nU.S.  12/583,691 discloses a geometry providing support of the modular tapered hollow reamer at two locations displaced at a distance from each other assuring concentric attachment of the reamer to the centerline of the shaft.  These arrangements of the\ndisposable reamer shaft are disclosed in FIGS. 2 through 4 below.\n FIG. 2 Illustrates at 20 a cross sectional view depicting a first embodiment of a disposable reamer shaft attached to one design of disposable modular spherical hollow reamer.

 'patent_description': u"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a disposable reamer shaft that may be attached to a modular disposable spherical or tapered hollow reamer, the disposable reamer shaft being concentrically attached to a modular hollow reamer to provide wobble\nfree rotation of the reamer tool.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  These procedures include hip replacement and shoulder replacement, and the like.  Reamers are used in procedures that involve creation of\nacetabular bone cavities that accept a properly sized acetabular cups.  Prior art reamers typically fall into two major classes: rigid and flexible shaft.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone cavity is achieved through utilization of a solid\nspherical reamer some having provisions for discharging and collecting reamed bone fragments.  Solid spherical reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally\ndenser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the acetabular cavity for a proper fit of the acetabular cup.  Conventional spherical reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses. \nOnce the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient friction/heat to damage or kill the surrounding bone.  These prior art solid spherical reamers are intended for multiple uses and\ntherefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  Dull blades also incorporate bone debris or bone cement debris into the living bone tissue, creating bone healing problems and fixation of an\nimplanted acetabular cup.\n U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,811,632, 5,100,267 and 5,299,893 to Salyer discloses a surgical reamer and a disposable acetabular reamer cup.  The first patent does not disclose a disposable shaft while the second and third patents does not assure the\nconcentricity of the cutting bowl with respect to that of the shaft.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,116,165 to Salyer discloses an acetabular reamer cup.  This '165 patent does not have a disposable shaft and the arrangement used has no direct connection between the shaft and the cutting bowl other than through the base\naperture.  The concentricity of the cutting bowl with respect to that of the shaft is therefore not assured.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,658,290 to Lechot discloses an assembly comprising reamer spindle and reamer for surgery.  The reamer comprises a cap and at least three radial rods which are arranged uniformly on the inside edge of the cap and join up\nintegrally at the center of the cap.  The reamer spindle comprises a shank on which there is fixed a reamer spindle head that is equipped with a bayonet with locking means for the securing of the reamer.  The securing catches of the bayonet are intended\nto receive the radial rods of the reamer.  The connection between the reamer rods and bayonet does not provide a precise centerline matching arrangement.  The shaft is not indicated to be disposable\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,709,688, as well as U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,001,105, and 6,428,543 to Salyer disclose an acetabular reamer cup and method of producing the same.  The bottom has a tool driver opening coaxial and is concentric with the cutting bowl. The driver opening engages with the shaft, which drives the acetabular reamer.  This form of attachment of the shaft with the acetabular reamer does not ensure alignment of axis of the shaft with that of the acetabular reamer.  The acetabular reamer or\nthe shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,755,719 to Frieze, et al. discloses an acetabular reamer.  This acetabular reamer includes a base, a first set of semi-circular blades attached to the base, and a second set of semi-circular blades also contacting said base,\nand crossing and intersecting with said first set of blades at right angles thereto.  The base preferably comprises a circular plate having a hexagonal drive hole in the center thereof and a plurality of slots in the periphery thereof for anchoring the\nblades.  The drive shaft is coupled to a hexagonal aperture in the base plate.  This method of attachment does not align the hemispherical cutter centerline with that of the drive shaft.  As such, the arrangement causes wobbliness of the cutter in the\nbone cavity.  The shaft of the acetabular reamer is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,976,144 to Fishbein et al. discloses a hollow dome reamer with removable teeth.  A drive shaft is connected to the base plate through an aperture in the base plate and held in place by a spring.  There is no direct attachment\nof the shaft to the dome and this multitude of connections to the shaft does not assure that the centerline of the shaft coincides with that of the hollow dome.  The shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,980,170 to Salyer as well as U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,817,096, 5,501,686, 5,282,804, 5,236,433, 5,171,313, 5,171,312 disclose a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is\nsecured at one of said shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool collate is secured at the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be\npositioned.  The boss has a distal end surface with a groove therein.  Both the groove and the distal end surface extend transversely of the axis.  A pin is positioned in the groove on the axis.  A latch mechanism is provided to hold a mounting bar of a\nrotary tool in the groove on the pin, whereby the rotary tool is held exactly coaxially of the driver during use.  The rotary tool, which is used with the driver has a bar which has the same dimensions as the groove in the boss of the tool driver of the\ninvention.  The bar thus fills the slot and is complementary to the slot.  The bar has a hole therein which is complementary to the pin.  The pin extends coaxially of the shaft and the boss.  The bar hole in which the pin of the tool driver is positioned\nis precisely coaxial of the axis of the tool about which the cutting edges are precisely positioned.  The tool driver has a shaft appointed to receive acetabular reamer cups and patella cutters.  The cutters are appointed to be connected to the tip of\nthe shaft by means of mounting bar in the cutter and a slot in the shaft secured by a complementary pin.  This method of attachment--using a mounting bar that slides into a slot--does not align the centerline of the shaft with that of the reamer. \nMoreover, the shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,168,600 to Grace, et al discloses an acetabular reamer backing plate and method of use.  The backing plate for an acetabular reamer assembly that has a planar surface allows for the attachment of a reamer driver.  This\nattachment feature only uses a single point attachment of the reamer to the shaft at the edge profile of the backing plate.  It is therefore subject to displacement of the shaft laterally, causing the centerlines of the shaft and reamer to be not\nprecisely aligned.  The shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,409,732 to Salyer discloses a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is secured at one of the shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool\ncollate is secured to the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be positioned.  The boss is equipped with a securing device of the bayonet type having a latch\nmechanism, which holds the rotary tool on the boss coaxially of the driver during use.  The securing device has a tapered bore extending from the distal end of the boss axially of the shaft.  The rotary tool has a diametrical bar extending across a\nbottom tool driver opening with a centrally located circular disk therein.  The disk of the rotary tool fits within the bore of the tool shaft boss so as to concentrically locate the rotary tool and the tool shaft on the same axis.  The latch mechanism\nholds the tool driver and the tool together in this position, whereby rotary tools of a multitude of sizes can be secured concentrically to the tool shaft without holding a plurality of critical tolerances when machining the bayonet type securing device\nor the rotary tool bottom bar.  The tool driver is a shaft with a slot on the end that receives the acetabular reamer.  It deals with the details of the device for attaching the acetabular reamer to the shaft.  This type of slotted attachment does not\nresult in coaxial mounting of the reamer that is coincident with the centerline of the shaft, even though the different components of the shaft are said to be coaxially aligned.  The reamer or the shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,875,217 to Wolford discloses an orthopedic reamer assembly.  This orthopedic reamer assembly includes a reamer with a generally hemispherical shell having a concave side and at least one attachment feature associated with the\nconcave side.  A driver is attachable to the reamer and has a shaft with a reamer end.  A releasable collar is disposed on the reamer end, which includes a boss having at least one retaining pin.  A sleeve is fitted over the boss and includes a groove\nthat is proximate to a corresponding retaining pin.  The reamer has a cavity in the reamer end with a biasing element.  The biasing element biases the sleeve in a closed position respective to the boss.  A release pin, which press fits into the sleeve is\nprovided in the reamer end, and is conveyed through the cavity, with the biasing element biasing against the release pin.  The orthopedic reamer assembly is a complicated attachment of design of the drive shaft to an acetabular reamer with multiple\nsliding parts.  Since each of the sliding parts requires a sliding fit, there are inherent displacement possibilities and therefore, the centerline of the shaft is not reliably aligned with the centerline of the acetabular reamer.  Moreover, the\nacetabular reamer or the shaft is not indicated to be disposable and requires complicated machined elements to enable a sliding fit.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0181916 to Wolford discloses an orthopedic reamer with flat cutting teeth.  This orthopedic reamer is for cutting bone and includes a shaft and a head coupled with the shaft.  The head includes a\ndistal face with a plurality of cutting teeth.  Each cutting tooth includes a hole extending through the head.  At least a portion of each hole has a substantially round perimeter.  A raised lip is positioned adjacent to and extends around at least part\nof the substantially round portion.  The '916 publication discloses an orthopedic reamer with flat cutting teeth having a shaft attached to acetabular reamer cups.  The reamer cups or the shaft of the '916 publication are not disposable in nature.  The\nattachment of the acetabular reamer to the drive shaft includes a complicated mechanism and does not reliably align the centerline of the drive shaft with that of the acetabular reamer.  As such, wobble free rotation is not provided.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0088757 to Tulkis discloses an acetabular reamer.  The reamer assembly includes a tool driver and a tool.  Tool driver comprises a shaft.  The tool receiving end of the shaft has a flange.  Formed in\nthe flange are four L-shaped bayonet catches, which receive the tool.  The tool has a body having slots.  A cutter can slidably fit into the slots.  When installed in the slots, the cutters project slightly above the body.  The projecting portions of the\ncutters form the cutting edges for shaving or cutting tissue.  The reamer is formed by attaching a tool to the tool driver by lowering it in the L-shaped bayonet catches.  The reamer can be coupled to a drive means such as a hand drill and inserted in a\nbody cavity.  Operating the reamer against body tissue shaves of body tissue.  This type of four L-shaped bayonet catches attaching a shaft to a reamer does not provide precise alignment of the centerline of the reamer and the shaft since it is a single\nlocation attachment and is subject to rotational movement.  The shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n Foreign Publication No. WO 9007908 to Schelhas discloses an acetabulum reamer.  Acetabulum reamer for reaming the acetabulum of the human pelvic bone prior to insertion of an artificial hip joint cup comprises a reamer head on a shaft and a\nspiral reaming ridge arranged about the axis of the shaft and provided with reaming devices.  The outer edge of the reaming ridge is delimited by a section of a spherical surface whose axis of rotation is flush with the axis of the shaft.  The acetabulum\nreamer utilizes a spherical head for reaming a socket in an acetabulum.  The spherical shape of the multiple use reamer provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the bone joints.  Significantly, the acetabulum reamer publication does not\nteach a disposable spherical hollow surgical reamer tool that is attached to a drive shaft with coincident centerlines.\n A number of prior art patents disclose use of polymeric shaft for delivering rotational torque.  These polymeric shafts generally are tubular in construction with glass fibers or carbon fibers embedded in the polymer matrix.  However, these\npolymeric shafts are rather large in diameter and short in overall length and generally unsuited for reamer shafts, which are required to be small in diameter and long in length.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,171,626 to Yates, et al. discloses a carbon fiber reinforced composite drive shaft.  A carbon fiber reinforced composite tubular drive shaft has a plurality of bonded circumferentially disposed layers of fibrous reinforcement\nsituated within an epoxy resinous matrix material.  The innermost layer has glass fibers disposed at +30.degree.  to +50.degree.  to the longitudinal axis of the shaft.  The outermost layer has glass fibers disposed at +60.degree.  to 90.degree.  to the\nlongitudinal axis of said shaft.  An intermediate layer has glass fibers disposed at 0.degree.  to +15.degree.  to the longitudinal axis of said shaft.  An intermediate layer has carbon fibers disposed at 0.degree.  to +15.degree.  to the longitudinal\naxis of said shaft.  The light weight composite drive shaft is resists torsion buckling to without deleteriously influencing the critical speed of the drive shaft.  The drive shaft is not indicated to be for use in attaching hollow reamers.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,248,062 to McLain, et al. discloses a drive shaft assembly and method for making same.  A composite drive shaft having a hollow tubular, multi-layered fiber reinforced plastic shaft portion with a metallic sleeve inserted in\nand bonded thereto at least at one end, said sleeve having a universal joint connector.  The tubular, fiber-reinforced plastic shaft has layers of oppositely angled resin-impregnated helical fibers at 25.degree.  to 65.degree.  to the longitudinal shaft\naxis and at least one layer of longitudinal fibers forming a laminate and a metallic sleeve is received within at one end and longitudinal fibers provides flexural rigidity to the laminate and oppositely angled layers provide torsional strength and inner\nspiral layer provides additional hoop strength to the laminate.  This drive shaft assembly has a universal joint and does not connect to a hollow reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,259,382 to Schwan discloses fiber reinforced composite shaft with metal connector sleeves secured by adhesive.  The tubular fiber reinforced composite shaft comprises a shaft body formed of a plurality of integrally bonded\ncircumferential plies of solidified fiber reinforced resinous material.  A metal sleeve is mounted in at least one end of the shaft body.  A layer of adhesive material is disposed between an outer surface of the metal sleeve and an inner surface of the\nshaft body to bond the sleeve to the body.  This composite shaft assembly with adhesively bonded is not indicated to connect to a hollow reamer.\n There remains a need in the art for a modular easy-to-assemble spherical or tapered hollow reamer for medical applications having a disposable reamer shaft.  Also needed in the art is a disposable spherical hollow or tapered cutter assembly,\nwhich can be attached concentric to a reusable shaft portion that provides means for reaming of a bone cavity without wobbly movement.  Further needed in the art is a cutter assembly having means for collecting bone debris and keeping the collected\ndebris displaced from the cutting portion, so that heat generated at the bone cutting surface is minimized.  Still further needed in the art is a disposable shaft for a spherical hollow or tapered reamer assembly wherein, after one use of the spherical\nor tapered hollow reamer, a clean contamination-free replacement shaft is provided.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a disposable shaft for reamers.  Reamer shafts are typically long with a shaft length in the range of 250 to 400 millimeters.  These shafts have a small shaft diameter typically in the range of 4 to 14 millimeters,\npreferably 5 millimeters for hollow tattered reamers and 14 mm for spherical hollow reamers.  The shaft must have certain features for the concentric attachment of the disposable shaft with a disposable modular hollow reamer.  Moreover, the other side of\nthe disposable shaft requires certain features for attachment to a drill or suitable drive drain.  Machining such small-diameter long-length shafts with precision is generally difficult and time consuming; this results in reamer shaft cost that is well\nover thousand dollars.  The shafts may be rigid or flexible depending on the type and orientation of the bone cavity being surgically reamed.  The reamer shaft may be solid or cannulated, meaning that it has a central hole for inserting a guide pin.\n Precisely dimensioned rods as well as tubes are readily available in the market place.  Precision machining of small sized attachment pieces is readily carried out at a low manufacturing cost.  The present invention contemplates attaching these\nsmall sized attachment pieces to a standard commercially available precision rods and tubes using gluing methods including use of epoxy glues in a fixture that creates precise alignment of the rod or tube shaft with the attachment pieces, one at each\nend.  The attachment features may be affixed with an aperture drilled within the rod or affixed over the outside diameter of the rod or tube.  Conveniently, the hole present within the tube may be used for affixing the attachment pieces.  The attachment\npieces are configured according to the attachment requirements of a specific modular reamer to which the disposable reamer shaft will be attached and may be a male threaded or female threaded screw attachment.  The other side of the rod or tube is glued\nto an attachment piece that is a chuck drive, J&J drive or other driver that connects to other drive mechanisms.\n Solid rigid shafts are made from precisely dimensioned rod stock of stainless steel or other suitable alloy or fiber reinforced plastic.  Cannulated shafts are made from precisely dimensioned tubular stock.  Flexible shafts solid or cannulated\nare made from Nitinol or fiber reinforced plastic.  The fiber reinforced plastic may have fiber wraps surrounding a polymeric rod or tube that circumferentially reinforced for transmitting torque.  The solid Nitinol shaft may be wire cut in a helical\npattern to provide a spring like structure providing the desired flexibility.  This wire cutting step may increase the reamer cost due to machining operation.  However, when the shaft is required to be rigid additional fiber reinforcement is provided\nalong the longitudinal length of the shaft to limit flexure.  The reinforcing fibers may be selected from carbon filaments, boron filaments, glass fibers, polyaramid fibers (Kenval.TM.), liquid crystal long chain polymer fibers (Spectra.TM.) or\ncombinations thereof.\n Specifically, the attachment between the disposable spherical or tapered hollow reamer and the disposable shaft is accomplished by a precision threaded screw attachment at one end and a support feature at a distance away from the first threaded\nattachment location.  This provides two attachment locations that are at a distance from each other providing precise rotational centerline alignment of the reamer shaft and the hollow reamer.  The disposable reamer shaft has at one end a corresponding\nmetallic fitting with precision threads adapted to connect to threads of the hollow reamer.\n The process for manufacturing the low cost disposable reamer shaft for disposable spherical or tapered hollow reamer involves the following steps: 1.  selecting a rod stock or tube stock with a precise outer diameter in the range of 4 to 14\nmillimeters; 2.  cutting the rod or tube to required shaft length in the range of 250 to 400 millimeters for a disposable reamer shaft; 3.  providing rod or tube end configuration for receiving attachment pieces; 4.  machining attachment pieces with\nprecise threads for attachment to a modular hollow reamer on one side and attachment pieces for attachment to drive power unit on one end, both types of pieces provided with an appropriate geometry for attachment for ends of a rod or tube; and 5.  gluing\nwith epoxy using a fixture that aligns centerlines a tube or rod with a modular hollow reamer attachment piece on one end and a drive connecting attachment piece of the other end; wherein said low cost disposable reamer shaft is solid or flexible with or\nwithout cannulation is fabricated from stainless steel, reinforced plastic or Nitinol and is centerline matched to hollow reamer.

This preparation can be intended for either cementing an acetabular cup (preparation\nwould be oversized to the implant) or press fitting an acetabular cup (preparation undersized to the implant).  In either case, a spherically shaped cutter is used to machine the internal geometry of the acetabulum.  These spherical cutting tools are\nrequired to cut both cortical bone (hard bone) and cancellous bone (spongy bone) during normal surgery.  The spherical cutter is generally assembled to a drive shaft which is coupled to a power drill and this assembly is used to machine the acetabulum\nfor the implant.  These cutters are intended for multiple surgeries and are used many times for many patients.  The cutting action of these reamers is afforded by a plurality of cutting teeth.  Because these teeth encounter hard bone and they are used\nmultiple times, the cutters can become dull and inefficient in their cutting ability.  Two primary problems exist with this type of instrument and surgical method:\n 1.  Since these spherical cutters are reused, special attention is needed in properly cleaning them prior to use in preparing the next patient's acetabulum.\n 2.  The cutting teeth can become dull even after one use and therefore do not cut bone efficiently.  In addition, this cutting inefficiency generates friction/heat which can damage or kill the surrounding bone.\n As these cutters become dull, they also do not cut an accurate preparation for the implant either in size or spherical geometry.  Even initially, these cutters can be not accurately concentric which is further compounded by the wear and use of\nthe cutter.  Although these cutters are intended for multiple uses, there are really not quality control measures which monitor their function and eventual need to be replaced.  There are not programs/qualified personnel in the hospitals that can inspect\nand evaluate the function and dimensional accuracy of the cutters after they have been used.  It would be beneficial for the patient and the hospital to be assured that the surgeon could always be supplied with a clean/sterile spherical cutter with\naccurate and sharp cutting teeth for every clinical case.\n Reaming of bone cavity is required during many orthopedic surgical procedures.  These procedures include hip replacement and shoulder replacement and the like.  Reaming of the bone cavities for the placement of an acetabular cup requires milling\nof precisely shaped bone cavity.  When the acetabular cup is fixed by interference, this precision is more critical than when the acetabular cup is bonded to the bone cavity by a cement composition.\n Generally stated, the disposable reamer shaft for disposable modular spherical or tapered hollow reamer for medical applications broadly comprises: (i) a disposable reamer shaft made from a rod or tube stock having precise outer diameter; (ii)\none end of said rod or tube stock glued with epoxy or other suitable glue to a hollow reamer attachment piece that has appropriate affixing features portion at one end and threaded connection at its other end for attachment to said hollow reamer; (iii)\nother end of said rod or tube stock glued with epoxy or other suitable glue to power drive attachment piece that has appropriate affixing features portion at one end and chuck connection features on its other end.\n The reamer shaft especially cannulated versions and flexible versions accumulate body fluids in the bent region as well as the cannulated central hole, which are impossible to clean contaminating the next patient when the reamer shaft is reused. The precision machining requirement of a long small diameter reamer shaft is very expensive resulting in reamer shaft cost in the range of several thousands of dollars.  Therefore, it is desirable to provide a low cost disposable reamer shaft combating\nthese contamination issues and reamer cost.\n The disposable reamer shaft must be provided on one end with attachment features suited for attachment to disposable modular spherical or tapered hollow reamers with a precise centerline attachment.  The other end of the disposable reamer shaft\nmust have attachment features to connect the reamer shaft to a power drive unit.  The disposable modular spherical hollow reamer disclosed in previously filed applications bearing Ser.  Nos.  12/072,671 and 11/583,704 disclose two different geometries\nproviding support of the modular spherical hollow reamer at two locations displaced at a distance from each other assuring concentric attachment of the reamer to the centerline of the shaft.  The previously filed application bearing Ser.  Nos. \n11/973,260 and 11/583,691 discloses a geometry providing support of the modular tapered hollow reamer at two locations displaced at a distance from each other assuring concentric attachment of the reamer to the centerline of the shaft.  These\narrangements of the disposable reamer shaft are disclosed in FIGS. 2 through 4 below.\n FIG. 2 Illustrates at 20 a cross sectional view depicting a first embodiment of a disposable reamer shaft attached to one design of disposable modular spherical hollow reamer.

 'patent_description': u'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a patient transfer systems; and more particularly to a patient lifter mattress that supports a patient while at rest and provides heated or cooled air surrounding the patient during the resting period, or during\nintra operative transfers, increasing the level of comfort experienced by the patient.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n The lateral transfer of patients, especially in the operating room, can be a difficult and poorly controlled procedure.  Not only can the patient be injured during the process, but lateral patient transfer often contributes to back injuries\nincurred by hospital personal.  The development of an air lifter, similar to a hovercraft, represents a significant advance in handling of patients.  Making the device disposable has obvious advantages for sterility and cleanup.  However, there is\nresistance in employing disposable lateral transfer devices for single usage because of associated costs.  As a result, use of disposable lateral transfer devices is generally limited to special situations, such as when transporting very large patients. \nThe patients may suffer from extreme cold or heat exposure during transport after a surgical procedure and controlling the temperature surrounding that patient with heated or cooled controlled temperature air delivery requires a tent having an enclosure,\nwhich is generally not portable.\n In order to improve the usefulness of the lifter, combining the current transfer usage with that of an intra operative heater would make the device much more attractive for purchase by hospitals and surgical centers.  Disposable intra operative\nheaters are already in general use, employing a simple heated air blower and a light plastic "tent".  Thermal coverings have been provided.  This device is broadly utilized throughout the world.  Water blankets, the alternative, are mats filled with\nheated circulating water.  While effective, these mats often come apart during patient transfer, causing a veritable flood on the operating room floor, and necessitating significant cleanup.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,644,950 to Lindsay et al. discloses a patient support system.  Included with the system is a bed for supporting and treating a hospital patient.  A lamination of low and medium density plastic foam is enclosed in a pressurized\ncontainer.  An open pore foam layer on top of the container produces a flow of air from the top of the foam layer for patient ventilation.  Control of the volume of air varies the degree of ventilation.  The pressurizing air for the container is\ncontrolled to vary the relative firmness of support.  The patient support of the \'950 patent provides ventilation around the patient delivered through foams of different density.  The ventilation air is not heated.  There is no discharge of air on the\nbottom surface of the patent support system enabling the creation of an air cushion that facilitates the lateral movement of a patient.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,667,073 Renfroe discloses a patient transporter.  This apparatus provides for effortless moving of a non-ambulatory patient from a bed or operating table to a cart, e.g., recovery room stretcher or the like and from the cart to\nother non-porous surfaces, e.g., X-ray tables, etc. The patient transporter discharges compressed air through the apertures in the bottom of an inflatable mattress to levitate the mattress from an impervious stretcher or bed during lateral transport of\nthe patient.  The compressed air may be discharged from apertures provided on top of the inflatable mattress to essentially levitate the patient with burns or severe injury by a plurality of air jets.  These air jets may aggravate the patient\'s injury. \nWhile the discharge of compressed air at the bottom of the inflatable mattress facilitates the lateral movement of the patient, the patient transporter does not provide heated air surrounding the patient.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,740,777 to Dee discloses a bed support.  This bed support holds all or part of the human body and includes a chamber having an upper wall at least part of which is of thin flexible sheet material, e.g. rubber film, adapted when\nsupported by gas pressure in the chamber to define a trough in which the item may lie.  The body support device merely inflates balloons surrounding an individual body portion and the balloons have apertures that discharge air towards the body part\nthrough PTFE or polyethylene disks.  This discharge of air through the apertures and the disk separates the balloons\' external surfaces from the body part by the flow of air.  No air is discharged on the bottom of the body support, with the result that a\npatient laying on the body support cannot be easily transported laterally.  Moreover, no heated air is discharged to surround the patient and thereby provide warmth and comfort.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,757,366 to Sacher discloses a cushion for preventing and alleviating bedsores.  The cushion for preventing and alleviating bedsores includes a warm air delivery system which delivers warm air in the close area of the cushion\nthat contacts the skin of the patient, thereby preventing direct contact between the skin and the cushion and preventing or alleviating bedsores.  No warm air is discharged below the cushion since the bottom portion of the cushion is indicated to be\nnon-porous.  Thus, the cushion with the patient laying there above may not be easily transported laterally.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,778,851 to Howorth discloses a mattress for use in treating a patient who has undergone extensive surgery or who has been severely burned.  The mattress comprises an upper panel, a lower panel, and means for supplying air to\nthe space between the two panels.  The lower panel is made of air-impermeable material.  At least a part of the upper panel is perforated to allow conditioned air to issue there from.  The conditioned air impinges on and passes around the patient.  It\nsubstantially isolates the patient from ambient air to reduce strain on the heart and promote healing.  The mattress supplies conditioned air having proper temperature and humidity.  Such air is free of bacterial contamination.  It surrounds a patient\nthat is supported on a mattress having a foam sponge support and air flow.  The sponge supports the patient, while ribs allow air supply to pass through.  The air surrounds the patient, preventing direct contact between the patient and the air permeable\ncover.  Since the lower portion of the mattress is indicated to be impermeable, no air is delivered in the bottom of the mattress.  As a result, a patient lying on the mattress may not be easily transported laterally.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,822,425 to Scales discloses an inflatable support appliance.  The inflatable support apparatus of the \'425 patent has an air impermeable base with air impermeable protrusions to which an air permeable cap is mounted.  A person\nsupported by these caps receives air through the apertures provided in the cap, preventing direct contact between the person and the cap.  No air is delivered at the bottom, since the base and the protrusions are air impermeable.  As a result, when a\npatient is supported by the caps, the lateral movement of the patient is very difficult, if not impractical.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,279,044 to Douglas discloses a fluid support system for a medical patient.  Medical patients, such as those having burns or bed sores, are supported fully or in part by this fluid system.  The system is directed to reducing\nlocal bearing pressure on body tissue.  The fluid support system for a medical patient inflates a plurality of individual cell, which enlarge and contact the body and collapse as load of the patient is shared.  No air is delivered between the patient and\nthe walls of the cells.  No air is released on the bottom of the support system and the lateral movement of the patient for example from a stretcher to an operating system is not easily possible.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,391,009 to Schild et al. discloses a ventilated body support.  This ventilated support for living bodies comprises an inflatable alternating pressure pad, which is either enclosed by or forms a part of an air permeable plenum\nchamber through which air is pumped at low pressure to provide a source of ventilating air to a body resting on the support.  The alternating pressure pad which is inflated by a high pressure pump has two sets of interdigitated cells which are\nalternately inflatable and deflatable and carry the weight of a body alternately, on each of the two sets of cells.  The disclosed ventilated body support has a plurality support tubes comprising a high pressure central sealed portion and a low pressure\nsurrounding portion each pressurized by two tubes with individual valves from a pump.  The two portions may bleed air to the environment to adjust the support character of the ventilated body support.  Heated air is not released surrounding the patient. \nNo air is released in the bottom of the ventilated body support and a patient lying on the ventilated body support may not be laterally moved easily.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,022,110 to Stroh discloses a low air loss mattress.  The low air loss mattress is made of multiple cushions, which are connected together and form an integral mattress which may be used on a standard hospital bed.  The multiple\ncushions allow for variable pressure to support a patient and to compensate for different weights of various portions of the body of the patient.  Each cushion is provided with air vents in its upper surface to provide air circulation around a patient\nand for pressure regulation in each cushion.  The air may be heated.  Retainers are provided to prevent billowing of each cushion in its center portions and maintain a substantially level patient support surface.  A small portable blower provides a\nconstant air supply for each of the cushions and allows adjustment of the air pressure in each of the cushions to accommodate varying weights of patients on the mattress.  Any release of air occurs only on the patient contacting surface, and the air may\nbe heated.  There is no discharge of air on the bottom of the low air loss mattress.  A patient lying on the mattress may not be easily moved laterally since there is no air cushion under the mattress assisting this movement.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,109,560 to Uetake discloses a ventilated air mattress with alternately inflatable air cells having communicating upper and lower air chambers.  The ventilated air mattress with alternately inflatable air cells has a plurality\nof adjacent cells.  One of the cells is inflated while the adjacent cell is deflated altering the support characteristic of the air mattress at a specific body contacting location so that no individual part of the body has to support the bodyweight over\na period of time.  The deflating of the cell is accomplished by opening a valve and the air is not heated and is not discharged surrounding the patient.  No air is discharged from the bottom surface of the ventilated air mattress and therefore, moving a\npatient lying on the air mattress laterally is not assisted by an air cushion and therefore is very difficult.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,168,589 to Stroh et al. discloses a pressure reduction air mattress and overlay.  This patent is a continuation in part of U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,022,110, discussed above.  Multiple cushions allow for variable pressure to support a\npatient and to compensate for different weights of various portions of the body of the patient.  Each cushion is provided with air vents in its upper surface to provide air circulation around a patient and for pressure regulation in each cushion.  The\nair may be heated.  Retainers are provided to prevent billowing of each cushion in its center portions and maintain a substantially level patient support surface.  A small portable blower provides a constant air supply for each of the cushions and allows\nadjustment of the air pressure in each of the cushions to accommodate varying weights of patients on the mattress.  Any release of air occurs only on the patient contacting surface and the air may be heated.  There is no discharge of air on the bottom of\nthe low air loss mattress and therefore a patient lying on the mattress may not be easily moved laterally since there is no air cushion under the mattress assisting this movement.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,249,318 to Loadsman discloses an air cushion support.  This air inflatable support appliance has internally sealed seams, internal diaphragms and internal structural support members.  The air cushion support of the \'318\ninvention provides a flow of air between the top portion of the support and the patient lying there over requiring no cover or drawsheet.  There is no discharge of air on the bottom of the air cushion support and the patient may not be transferred\nlaterally from a stretcher to an operating table since no air cushion support is available at the bottom of the air cushion support.  Moreover, presence of three or more individual cushions makes any movement of the patient lying on the bed very\ndifficult.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,483,709 to Foster et al. discloses a low air loss mattress with rigid internal bladder and lower air pallet.  This mattress has an upper patient supporting low air loss bladder for ventilating and preventing skin degeneration\nof a patient supported.  An intermediate rigidly inflatable static bladder becomes relatively rigid upon inflation to aid in transferring or weighing a patient.  A lower high air loss bladder is provided for reducing the friction force between the\nmattress and the supporting surface to facilitate surface-to-surface transfers.  The high air loss bladder includes a peripheral tube, which seals against a supporting surface to contain the air, which escapes from longitudinal sacks within the tube. \nThe foot sections of the low air loss and static bladders are selectively deflatable.  The low air loss mattress has a low air loss bladder 12, an intermediate rigidly inflatable static bladder 14 and a lower high air loss bladder 18.  The low air\ndischarge bladder releases air surrounding the patient, reducing patient contact with the low air loss bladder.  The air volume is generally small due to the small space separation between the patient and the top portion of the device.  An intermediate\npressurized rigid bladder supports the patient.  The lower high air loss bladder serves to create an air cushion that allows the patient on the device to be moved easily.  The low air loss bladder locally `floats` the patient off the mattress surface. \nMoreover, the low air discharge air bladder does not provide heated air and does not have sufficient air delivery capacity to surround the area around the patient with warm air.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,561,873 to Weedling discloses an air chamber-type patient mover air pallet with multiple control features.  This inflatable flexible pallet has rectangular dimensions defined by top and bottom sheets within which an array of\nstructurally interrelated inflatable chambers are formed to support a load when inflated.  The air chamber-type patient mover air pallet with multiple control features may be used for static support or a flow through system for moving a patient.  Even\nthough chambers are provided in the device, the chambers are generally interconnected and get the air from the air pressure source through valves.  The compressed air may be at a high temperature due to pressurization of air and therefore may warm the\nambient as well as the surface on which the patient is lying.  The mattresses are generally made from polymeric material and this warming action may be too severe and uncontrolled and may damage the polymeric membrane of the mattress and injure the\npatient.  The air chamber-type patient mover air pallet does not have two separate chambers disconnected from each other, the first chamber providing controlled heated or cooled air air surrounding the patient while a second separated chamber having\nadequate air flow to provide an air cushion for easy transverse movement of a patient.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,590,428 to Roter discloses an air pressurized person supporting device with ventilation.  This device is particularly useful for comfortably supporting a person and includes a hollow member having upper and lower walls joined\nto each other around their periphery and adapted to be air pressurized.  The upper wall is formed with a plurality of openings at spaced locations receiving a plurality of valve members, one for each opening.  Each valve member is normally biassed to a\nclosed position with respect to its opening, but is engageable by a person supported by the hollow member and is moved thereby to an open position to outlet air from its respective opening.  The air pressurized person supporting device with ventilation\nis pressurized by the application of air pressure.  Valves in the supporting device seal off everywhere except where the person applies pressure, providing ventilation of air.  The air is therefore released only under the patient and no air is released\nsurrounding the person.  Since no air is released under bottom surface of the support device, there is no air cushion.  As a result, the patient cannot be transversely displaced easily.  Further, the device does not provide heated air surrounding the\npatient.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,652,987 to Fujita discloses a decubitus ulcer prevention device.  This decubitus ulcer prevention device comprises an air generator with a fan and an air mattress for receiving air from the air generator.  Air is discharged at\na surface through minute air discharge holes.  A hose connects the air mattress to the air generator.  Along a flow path of the air that passes through the fan are located, in order as named, a heater and an alkaline chlorine dioxide gas generator, in\nwhich is internally provided a ceramic body that is impregnated with an alkaline chlorine dioxide solution.  Air that is heated, by passing through the heater, is brought into contact with the ceramic body, so that air that includes alkaline chlorine\ndioxide gas is thus supplied to the air mattress.  The decubitus ulcer prevention device delivers heated air or ambient air treated with chlorine dioxide through fine apertures on the skin contacting surface of an air mattress.  Air is not delivered on\nthe underside of the air mattress and, as a result, the air mattress with the supported patient may not be easily displaced in a transverse direction.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,781,943 to Moenning et al. discloses a medical table and method for moving a patient from a first position to a second position.  This medical table includes a base.  The medical table with roller support uses a motor to rotate\nthe rollers to change the position of the patient.  No air is delivered on the bottom surface of the medical table.  The lateral movement of the patient is not accomplished by the movement of an air mattress.  Instead, the patient is driven by rollers\nand a belt under the patient, and has to be assisted by medical personnel for proper placement.  Once the patient leaves this medical table, the patient has to be moved manually, causing hardship to the patient.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,546,576 to Lin discloses structure of a ventilated mattress with cooling and warming effect.  This structure of a ventilated mattress with cooling and warming effect comprises a mattress body, a warming/cooling air-delivery\ncontrolling box, and a connecting tube.  The control box produces warming/cooling air to the mattress body via the connecting tube and the warming/cooling air is released via a plurality of ventilation buttons mounted at the surface of the mattress body. Thereby, the mattress provides the user with a warming/cooling effect.  The mattress is not an air mattress, but has conventional springs to support a patient positioned on the mattress.  No air is delivered at the bottom surface of the mattress.  Due to\nthe absence of an air cushion at the bottom surface of the mattress, a patient lying on the mattress may not be laterally moved with ease.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,090,692 to Augustine et al. discloses a thermal blanket.  This thermal blanket includes an inflatable covering with a head end, a foot end, two edges and an undersurface.  The covering is inflated through an inlet at the foot\nend by a thermally-controlled inflating medium.  An aperture array on the undersurface of the covering exhausts the thermally-controlled inflating medium from the covering.  Exhaust port openings are provided at the edges of the covering to vent the\ninflating medium, which enhances circulation of the thermally-controlled medium through the cover.  An uninflatable section is provided at the head end, together with an absorbent bib attached to the covering, adjacent the uninflatable section.  When\ninflated, the thermal blanket self-erects and provides a bath of thermally-controlled inflating medium to the interior of the erected structure.  The blanket has an aperture free top surface and a side facing the patient is provided with a plurality of\napertures to discharge warm air that is supplied to the blanket.  The portion of the blanket near the head of a patient is free from these apertures and functions as an apron.  This is a thermal blanket that is provided with thermally controlled hot air\nand is not an air mattress that is provided with heated air.  Further, there is no air discharge under the bottom surface of a mattress to facilitate lateral movement of a patient.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,114,204 to Patrick discloses a method and apparatus for transferring patients.  This patient transfer apparatus includes an inflatable mattress, alternatively having a rigid top board with a patient restraint system on which a\npatient can be placed, when patient immobilization is required.  A portable cart is included with a chamber for storage of a plurality of mattresses.  The cart also has a gas/air blower and power supply system for empowering the blower.  Pressurized air\nis supplied to a single chamber of an air mattress, which discharges the air through the underside of the mattress.  While this passage of air creates an air cushion under the mattress, permitting lateral displacement of the patient, there is no\nindication that the pressure of supplied air is regulated.  No warm air is delivered to the patient positioned on the upper surface of the mattress device.\n Foreign Patent Publication No. JP2002000669 to Masato et al. discloses a bed and chair for nursing and care.  The bed or chair is lifted upwards by pumping air into an air pad 11.  No air is delivered at the bottom of a mattress to create an air\ncushion that facilitates movement of a patient.  This \'669 merely raises a bed or a chair.\n "AirMatt-Patent Transfer System" at web location http://www.midmed.com.au/index.php?module=pagesetter&func=viewpub&tid=2&p- id=5 5&header=1 discloses Airmatt|Lateral Air Transfer System.  The AirMatt system only provides air at the bottom\nsurface of the mattress for easy displacement of a patient.  No heated air is delivered from the top surface of the mattress for providing comfort to the patient during intra operative transport.\n "AirPal-Patient Air Lift" at web location http://www.airpal.com/manual1.pdf discloses a patient transfer system.  The AirPal-Patient Air Lift has a mattress on which the patient is positioned.  Air is supplied to the mattress to enable the\nlateral movement of the patient, who floats on an air cushion.  The mattress is not moved.  Rather, the floating patient is moved.  No warm air surrounds the patient.\n "Hover Tech International-HoverMatt" is found at web location http:/Hwww.hovermatt.com/.  The brochure is available at http://www.hovermatt.com/media.pdf/HoverMatt Brochure.pdf.  It discloses HoverMatt.RTM.  Air Transfer Mattress.  The HoverMatt\nprovides air directly under the patient forming an air cushion so that the patient can be laterally slid on the mat.  There is no air provided on the bottom surface of the mat forming an aircushion.  The mat is not laterally slid.  Instead, the patient\nis slid by an attendant.  No warm air surrounds the patient.\n There remains a need in the art for a mattress that supports a patient effectively at all times with minimal usage of compressed air while at the same time providing the functionality of a patient lifter for easy transfer of the patient from a\nstretcher to an operating table, bed or the like without straining the patient or hospital workers.  There is also need for an air mattress that provides a supply of heated or cooled air surrounding the patient, increasing the patient comfort level\nwithout having to use tents and elaborate construction that limits the opportunity to observe the patient at rest or during intra operative transport.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a system and method for a patient lifter having intra operative delivery of controlled temperature air surrounding a patient.  The system is generally a mattress having a bottom surface and a top surface, a heated\nair top compartment and an ambient air bottom chamber separated by a diaphragm.  The top surface has a plurality of apertures therein.  A heated air chamber has an inlet aperture attached to a hose.  Heated air travels through the heated air chamber. \nApertures on the top surface of the mattress deliver heated air to a patient positioned proximate to the top surface of the mattress.  The patient lifter mattress ambient air bottom chamber is inflatable.  It is constructed with small holes in the bottom\nsurface to allow air to exit, creating an air cushion that slightly levitates the mattress above an impermeable surface of a stretcher or a bed.  Such construction facilitates transfer of the patient from the stretcher to an operating table.  When the\npressure in the ambient air bottom chamber is small, the apertures on the bottom of the bed are blocked by the weight of the mattress.  The latter discharges a minimal quantity of ambient air and serves to support the patient in a manner similar to a\nconventional air mattress.  When the patient needs to be laterally displaced, the compressed air regulated pressure is increased to a higher level, allowing air to leak from the apertures provided in the bottom surface of the mattress.  An air cushion is\nthereby created, substantially decreasing the friction for lateral displacement of the mattress, so that even a heavy patient may be moved with minimal effort.  Advantageously, with this arrangement hospital personnel are spared the difficult work of\nmoving the patient.\n The patient lifter and intra operative controlled temperature air delivery generally comprises: a mattress having a bottom surface, a top surface, and a heating or cooling chamber top chamber, lifting bottom chamber, top and bottom chambers\nseparated by a diaphragm.  The top chamber is provided with apertures therein, wherein an inlet aperture is appointed for attachment to a hose.  This hose is, in turn, adapted to supply heated or cooled air, which travels there through and communicates\nwith apertures within the top surface of said mattress for delivering heated air or cooled air to surrounding portions of a patient lying proximate to said top surface of said mattress.  The apertures directly below the patient are blocked by the\npatient, when the pressure in the top chamber is small with the result that heated air or cooled air is delivered strictly through the unblocked apertures, and surrounds the patient and the immediate surroundings.  When the pressure in the top chamber is\nslightly increased, some portion of the patient\'s body blocks the apertures while other portions directly below the patient separate the top surface of the mattress from the body of the patient thereby preventing direct contact between the skin of the\npatient and the mattress.  A patient generally moves in such a manner as to limit the contact pressure applied to a sore or other skin injury and the mattress gently provides heated or cooled area in these regions limiting contact between the sore or\nskin injury from the mattress as the patient selects a suitable posture.  The pressure in the top chamber may be pulsed from a small value to a slightly larger value, periodically changing the distribution of patient contacing points with the top surface\nof the mattress to thereby relieve contact pressure at the sores for skin injury locations.  Use of a surgical drape around the patient is sufficient to provide warmth to the patient without the need for a tent or other containment.\n The present invention solves the problems associated with providing comfort to a patient wherein a single mattress provides heated or cooled air surrounding the patient, which is retained by a simple surgical drape placed on the patient similar\nto a blanket without need for a tent and other structures.  The lower chamber of the mattress is supplied with pressure-regulated compressed air and apertures provided on the bottom surface of the lower chamber of the mattress are generally closed shut\ndue to the weight of the patient and the mattress.  However, when the patient needs to be laterally displaced, the compressed air regulated pressure is increased to a higher level allowing air to leak from the apertures provided in the bottom surface of\nthe lower chamber of the mattress.  An air cushion is created, causing the friction for lateral displacement of the mattress to be substantially decreased.\n In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the ambient air delivery into the bottom compartment is divided into two sub compartments, one to the left side of the mattress and one to the right side of the mattress.  Release of pressure on one\nside collapses the support on that side.  The air mattress becomes tilted, enabling the patient to be easily moved onto an operating table, bed, or the like.  With this embodiment, a heavy patient may be moved with minimal effort by hospital personnel. \nThe pressure in the top two chambers may be maintained at a small value allowing full contact between the patient\'s skin and the top surface of the mattress or may be maintained at a slightly larger value permitting partial contact of the patient\'s body\nwith the top surface of the mattress.  In this embodiment also, the pressure in the two top chamber may be pulsed from a small value to a slightly larger value, periodically changing the distribution of patient contacing points with the top surface of\nthe mattress so as to relieve contact pressure between the top surface of the mattress and sore or injured portions of the patient\'s body.\n In a further embodiment of the invention, the lower chamber of the mattress is divided into two lateral compartments that extend along the length of the mattress.  Each of the two individual compartments are pressured by regulated pressure which\ncan be individually controlled.  When the pressure in one of the compartments in the lower chamber of the mattress is reduced, the upper surface of the mattress tilts in the direction of the compartment with reduced pressure and the patient automatically\nmoves downwardly onto an operating table, or is easily moved from an operating table to the mattress of the subject invention, positioned on a stretcher.  Once the patient is firmly on the mattress of the subject invention, the pressure in the previously\npressure released chamber may be brought to normal value and the patient is now positioned on the mattress in a horizontal plane.\n In a further embodiment, the bottom chamber may be provided with an ambient air supply at a pressure that may be pulsed.  The air pressure may be pulsed from a small value to a slightly larger value which is sufficiently low to prevent the\nmattress from floating.  Thus the mattress becomes soft or rigid as the pressure is varied from a small value to a higher value.  Preferably, the bottom section comprises a plurality of sections arranged in an interlocking "S" or comb-shaped\nconfiguration.  Air pressure within these sections is alternately increased and decreased, creating along the top surface of the mattress a plurality of ridges when air pressure is greater in a first of the sections than the air pressure in a second of\nthe sections.  As air pressure in the first section decreases and air pressure in the second section increases, the ridges previously formed by the first section turn into valleys and the valleys formed by the second section become ridges.  In this\nmanner, the rigid mattress sections b-like contours on the top surface of the mattress especially when the top chamber is provided with a low pressure of heated or cooled air supply.  Pressure independently applied to these alternating ribs in the lower\nsection of the mattress cause the ribs to become alternatively harder and softer, thereby elevating them slightly in alternate fashion to change pressure applied to a patient lying on the mattress.  Advantageously, the ridges or ribs alter the points of\ncontact between the patient\'s skin and the top surface of the mattress thereby reliving pressure on sores or skin injury locations. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n The invention will be more fully understood and further advantages will become apparent when reference is had to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings, in which:\n FIG. 1 illustrates an air mattress for patients of the type disclosed by the prior art;\n FIG. 2 illustrates a first embodiment of the subject invention; and\n FIG. 3 illustrates a second embodiment of the subject invention.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n Patients are generally required to be transported from a hospital bed to an X-ray, CT or MRI facility for laboratory tests.  A patient may also be required to be transported from the hospital bed to an operating table.  Patients oftentimes labor\nunder a poor health condition, so that any movement of the patient results in extreme discomfort to the patient.  Further, patients with increased body weight are generally more difficult to move laterally and may cause injury to the patient as well as\nback injuries to hospital staff.  Recent development of airlift mattresses, as for example those marketed by AirMatt, AirPal or HoverMatt have resulted in an air mattress with air cushion-forming apertures thereunder, which enable a patient positioned on\nthe mattress to be laterally displaced on a flat or irregular surface with minimal effort.  The patient may be laterally moved from a hospital bed to a stretcher, or from a stretcher to an x-ray table or an operating table with ease.  However, these\nairlift mattresses do not surround the patient with controlled temperature airflow.  As a result the patient often experiences temperatures during the transport and transfer operations that are too cold or too warm.  Conventional methods for ambient\ntemperature control surrounding the patient require use of tents that, in turn, require the use of elaborate immobile hardware.\n FIGS. 1a and 1b depict a prior art inflatable air mattress disclosed by U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,114,204 to Patrick, which is laterally moved on an air jet cushion.  This device is in contrast with the products marketed by AirMatt, AirPal or HoverMatt\nwhere the air jets are directly below the patient and the patient generally `floats` on air, allowing easy displacement.  FIG. 1a illustrates an integrated patient transfer system including an inflatable air mattress assembled on a stretcher 12 (FIG. 8\nof the Patrick patent).  The air cushion and supply cart according to Patrick is illustrated in FIG. 1b (FIG. 3 of the Patrick patent).  The air mattress 22 is constructed with small holes in the bottom surface 48 to allow gas to exit from inside the\nmattress 22 so as to create an air cushion for levitating the air mattress.  A substantial portion of the air mattress 22 (approximately 90%) is preferably constructed of nylon, making it less expensive to fabricate than other prior art air mattresses.\n FIG. 2 illustrates at 200 a first embodiment of the subject invention.  Mattress 101 generally is provided with a top chamber 120 and a bottom chamber 121.  Mattress 101 includes a bottom surface 102, a top surface 103, and a separation barrier\n104 between the top chamber 120 and 121.  Top surface 103 is appointed with apertures 105a and 105b therein.  Generally, apertures 105a, located near the head portion of the mattress 101, are larger than apertures 105b located at the foot portion of\nmattress 101, delivering a higher quantity of comfort air to the upper portion of the body.  The apertures 105a and 105b may be selected to be of equal size without departing from the scope of the invention.  Low pressure compressed heated or cooled air\nsupply to the top chamber 120 is provided through a hose attached to inlet 106.  P indicates a pressure source and the circle with an arrow indicates a regulator.  The heated or cooled air travels through the top chamber 120 and is delivered through the\napertures 105a and 105b surrounding the patient lying on the mattress providing comfort, while the apertures of 105a and 105b directly below the patient are blocked.  The mattress 101 functions as air lift mattress wherein the bottom chamber 121 is\npressurized by ambient compressed air delivered at a pre-selected regulated pressure through the aperture 110.  P indicates a pressure source and the circle with an arrow indicates a regulator.  The bottom surface of the bottom chamber is provided with a\nplurality of apertures 108 through which the regulated pressure compressed air delivered through aperture may leak.  When the regulated pressure of compressed air is delivered at a low regulated pressure, the weight of the patient and the mattress blocks\nthe apertures and the bottom chamber is inflated, functioning in a manner similar to a conventional air mattress.  However, when the pre-selected regulated compressed air pressure is increased to a high value, air leaks through the apertures 108 creating\nan air cushion between the bottom surface 102 of the mattress and underlying flat or uneven surface such as a bed, stretcher or an operating table.  This air cushion essentially levitates the mattress with the patient slightly above the flat or uneven\nsurface and the patient may be laterally displaced with minimal effort.  Using this procedure, the patient is easily displaced laterally with minimal effort for example, from a bed to a stretcher or a stretcher to an operating table or any combination\nthereof.  When the patient is moved to a desired location, the compressed air pressure may be brought to the pre-selected low pressure value and the mattress rests at the desired location without any movement, functioning as a conventional air mattress.\n FIG. 3 illustrates at 300 the second embodiment of the subject invention.  The intra operative controlled temperature device that can be used for heating and/cooling of the immediate area surrounding the patient, by providing the circulation of\nheated air or cooled air using a low pressure blower.  Similar numerical indicia as FIG. 2 are used for clarity.  Mattress 101\' generally is provided with a top chamber 120 and a bottom chamber 121 separated from each other by a barrier 104a.  In this\nsecond embodiment, the bottom chamber has two parallel longitudinal compartments 121a and 121b separated by a second barrier 104b.  Compartments 121a and 121b are fed individually with their own regulated compressed air supply through inlets 110a and\n110b as shown.  P indicates a pressure source and the circle with an arrow indicates a regulator.  Since inflation of each side of the air mattress is individually controlled, reducing pressure in one of the compartments essentially tilts the mattress\nalong that direction allowing the patient to be gently rolled over, for example, into an operating table or a bed from a stretcher.  Similarly, loading of a patient into a stretcher may also be facilitated by this tilting, since the patient could be\nrolled over onto the air mattress instead of having to be lifted and positioned thereon.  Mattress 101 includes a bottom surface 102 with a plurality of apertures 108, which are blocked when the air mattress is on a flat or uneven surface and the\nregulated compressed air supplied at inlets 110a and 110b is low.  In this condition, the mattress behaves in a manner similar to a conventional air mattress, with minimal air leakage at the bottom 102 of the mattress.  However, when the regulated\ncompressed air pressure supplied at inlets 110a and 110b is increased beyond a certain value, the air mattress levitates, creating an air cushion.  With this feature, the mattress can be displaced laterally to move a patient thereon from a bed to a\nstretcher, or from a stretcher to an operating table or the like.  If either regulated compressed air pressure supplied at inlets 110a or 110b is decreased, the side of the air mattress associated with that inlet dips down, allowing the patient to be\nrolled gently or otherwise easily transferred from the air mattress to an ordinary operating table, hospital bed or the like.\n The key features of the patient lifter system wherein intra operative controlled temperature air surrounds a patient comprise, in combination:\n i) a mattress with a top chamber and a bottom chamber separated by a barrier;\n ii) said top chamber being provided with a plurality of small apertures on its top surface;\n iii) said top chamber being provided with a low pressure supply of compressed heated air or cooled air;\n iv) a patient lying on said top surface of the top chamber blocking the apertures immediately there below so that heated or cooled air delivered surrounds the patient when the pressure in the top chamber is set at a small value;\n v) a patient lying on said top surface of the top chamber blocking the apertures immediately there below at a locus defined by contact interface between the patient\'s body and the top surface of the mattress, to thereby provide for\npatient/mattress contact involving regions that are free from sore or skin injury, while the heated or cooled air is delivered to surrounding areas where sore or skin injury may be present, and further preventing sore or skin injury resulting from\ncontact between the injured portions of the patient\'s body and the top surface of the mattress when the pressure in the top chamber is set at a increased value;\n vi) a surgical drape surrounding the patient to provide comfort to the patient without need for a tent or other hardware;\n vii) said bottom chamber being provided with a supply of compressed ambient air at a pre-selectable regulated air pressure;\n viii) said bottom chamber having a plurality of apertures on its bottom surface;\n ix) said ambient air pressure inflating said bottom chamber and being portative to supporting a patient lying on the top surface of the top chamber in the manner of a conventional air mattress when apertures in the bottom surface are blocked by\nthe weight of the mattress and the patient and the ambient pressure is of a pre-selected low value, minimally discharging ambient air; and\n x) during lateral movement of the patient lying on said mattress, the compressed ambient air pressure is increased to a pre-selected high pressure, discharging air through said bottom surface of said bottom chamber to thereby create an air\ncushion directly under the mattress with the patient allowing easy effort-free movement of the patient from a stretcher to an operating table or from a bed to a stretcher.\n In a second embodiment, the mattress having a bottom chamber comprising two laterally separated compartments, each being provided with an individual regulated compressed ambient air supply, for collapsing one side to facilitate rolling of said\npatient onto an operating table or bed.\n Advantageously, the Patient Lifter with Intra Operative Heater System provides:\n i) a combination system with operative heater that delivers a warm or cold air stream surrounding a patient while apertures on the top surface are blocked by the patient, and a patient lifter/patient transport device;\n ii) an intra operative heater device that delivers heat from beneath a patient and can be used without a tent, the system having surgical drapes that are placed above the patient and function as a cover when heat is delivered from beneath the\npatient;\n iii) an air-cushion forming mechanism for developing compressed ambient air pressure that is increased to a pre-selected high pressure, discharging air through said bottom surface of said bottom chamber to thereby create an air cushion that\nfacilitates lateral movement of the patient onto an operating table or a hospital bed; and\n iv) an intra operative device that can be used for heating and/cooling, by providing the circulation of hot or cool air through a low pressure blower.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art.  For example,\nmattress 101 can be provided with a plurality of channels, which are alternately inflated to a pressure controlled by a pressure regulator, thereby enabling adjustment to be made of the air pressure supplied to the channels in accordance with the weight\nand shape of the patient.  The bottom section of the patient lifter can be divided into a plurality of interdigitating compartments that are pulsed from small pressure to a slightly larger pressure with a preselected pulse frequency, while the top\nchamber is maintained at a small pressure, causing the top surface of the mattress to replicate a rib-like contour created on the top surface of the bottom chamber upper surface.  With this arrangement, the patient lifter functions as an alternating\npressure mattress, redistributing points of contact pressure extant between the top surface of the mattress and body portions of a patient resting thereon to thereby avoid pressure sores and decubiti.  The length and width of the mattress can be adjusted\nto produce a half-size mattress configuration that facilitates lateral movement of the upper torso or lower body portion of the patient.  Such modifications are considered to fall within the scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

 'patent_description': u'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a modular easy-to-assemble modular spherical hollow reamer assembly for medical applications; and more particularly, to a spherical hollow reamer having a disposable spherical reamer, which can be attached\nconcentric to the centerline of a reusable shaft portion and includes a bone fragment and bone debris capturing cavity.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  These procedures include hip replacement and shoulder replacement, and the like.  Reamers are used in procedures that involve creation of\nacetabular bone cavities that accept a properly sized acetabular cups.  Prior art reamers typically fall into two major classes: rigid and flexible shaft.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone cavity is achieved through utilization of a solid\nspherical reamer some having provisions for discharging and collecting reamed bone fragments.  Solid spherical reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally\ndenser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the acetabular cavity for a proper fit of the acetabular cup.  Conventional spherical reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses. \nOnce the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient friction/heat to damage or kill the surrounding bone.  These prior art solid spherical reamers are intended for multiple uses and\ntherefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  These dull blades also incorporate bone debris or bone cement debris into the living bone tissue, creating bone healing problems and fixation of\nan implanted acetabular cup.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,116,200 to Braun et al. discloses a milling tool for surgical purposes.  This surgical milling tool is operated with a hand-operated milling machine for milling the heads or sockets of bone joints of a spherical shape.  The\ntool is formed of a hemispherical cup integrally formed with a cylindrical skirt and flange and is provided with a plurality of openings of semi-oval shape, each having a cutting edge arranged at the minor axis of the oval shape.  The openings are\nsituated such that, upon rotation of the cup, the cutting edges thereof overlap to provide a continuous cutting edge surface conforming generally to the shape of the cup.  The formation of fine bone shavings is avoided by use of this milling tool.  The\nsurgical milling tool utilizes a integrally formed hemispherical cup having a plurality of openings appointed with cutting edges for milling sockets of bone joints.  The hemispherical shape of cup provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of\nthe bone joints.  Bone and cartilage shavings are formed during the milling process and are collected in a border area inside of the hemispherical cup.  The surgical milling tool is provided for multiple use and is not a disposable spherical hollow\nreamer, and therefore the tool will become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,811,632 to Salyer discloses surgical reamer.  a method of producing an acetabular reamer cup.  This method comprises the steps of fabricating a bowl-shaped cup-blank having an outer surface, an inner surface and a rim,\nperforating a plurality of holes through the cup-blank, the holes each being surrounded by a margin, deforming outwardly a cutting portion of the margin of each of the holes, smoothing the outer surface of the cup-blank to sharpen the deformed cutting\nportions, raising cutting edges from the cutting portions and removing the rim.  The cutting edges are disposed to cut upon rotation of the acetabular reamer.  The cup manufactured by this method is preferred because of its improved strength and\nconsistently superior cutting edges.  The acetabular reamer utilizes a hemispherical or bowl-shaped cup having a spherical construction and a plurality cutting openings for milling sockets of joints.  The hemispherical shape of reamer provides the\nability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the bone joints.  The acetabular reamer is provided for multiple use, and therefore the tool will become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,100,267 and its continuation in part U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,299,893 to Salyer disclose a disposable acetabular reamer cup.  The disposable acetabular reamer cup has a cutting bowl having a plurality of cutting edges.  The cutting\nbowl has perforations adjoining the cutting edges.  The cutting bowl defines an axis of rotation.  The cutting bowl has a bottom opening.  A transparent polymeric plug is joined to the cutting bowl.  The plug is concentric with the axis of rotation.  It\noccupies the bottom opening; and has a tool driver opening concentric with the axis of rotation.  When a torque is applied, the bowl is turned with respect to the plug, which means that the cutting torque is transmitted through the plug and transferred\nto the cutting plug through the detents.  There is no direct connection between the shaft and the cutting bowl other than through the plug.  Concentricity of the cutting bowl with respect to that of the shaft is therefore not assured.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,116,165 to Salyer discloses an acetabular reamer cup.  This acetabular reamer cup comprises a cutting bowl having a plurality of singly curved cutting edges.  The cutting bowl has a plurality of slots preceding the cutting\nedges.  The cutting bowl defines an axis of rotation.  A bottom is joined to the cutting bowl.  The bottom has a tool driver opening concentric with the axis of rotation.  With a right handed acetabular reamer cup that cuts when pressed against a\nsubstrate and rotated in a clockwise direction, slots are positioned to the right of respective cutters.  There is no direct connection between the shaft and the cutting bowl other than through the base aperture.  The concentricity of the cutting bowl\nwith respect to that of the shaft is therefore not assured.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,376,092 to Hein, et al. discloses a reamer for shaping bone sockets.  This reamer shapes a socket, such as a hip socket.  It comprises a cutting head located at one end of a rotatably driven shaft and having a hemispherical\nportion with a hemispherical exterior surface.  The hemispherical portion contains an open substantially hollow chamber and helical openings such as slots, in said hemispherical portion connecting between the exterior surface and the chamber.  The\ntrailing portion of each of the openings has a cutting or trailing edge raised slightly above the leading edge of the opening or slot to move material from the socket into the chamber during rotation of the cutting head.  The cutting edges having\nserrations thereon.  At least two cutting edges extending across the polar region of the cutting head.  A stem extending from the interior center point of the substantially hollow chamber and extending along the polar axis of the hemispherical reamer for\nconnecting and disconnecting the cutting head to a rotatable source.  The reamer for shaping bones is a solid reamer that is not disposable.  It is attached to a drive shaft by sliding the shaft into an aperture and locking with a pin, as shown in the\ndrawing.  Since there is always a slack between a cylindrical shaft and a cylindrical aperture, the reamer is not centered in alignment with the shaft centerline.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,709,688, as well as U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,001,105, and 6,428,543 to Salyer disclose an acetabular reamer cup and method of producing the same.  This method for making an acetabular reamer cup for an acetabular reamer comprises\nthe steps of: fabricating a bowl shaped cup-blank having outer and inner bowl shaped surfaces, perforating a plurality of holes through the cup-blank, the holes each are surrounded by a curved margin, deforming outwardly of the outer surface a cutting\nportion of the margin of each of the holes, thereby forming cutting edges, the cutting portions are curved outwardly of the outer surface, the cutting edges are curved tangentially of the outer surface and disposed to cut upon rotation of the acetabular\nreamer.  An acetabular reamer cup is also provided with a cutting bowl having a plurality of curved cutting edges.  The cutting bowl has a plurality of openings preceding the cutting edges, and a generally conical rise following the cutting edges.  The\ncutting edges are spirally arranged about the axis of rotation of the cutting bowl, and a bottom adjoined to the cutting bowl.  The bottom has a tool driver opening coaxial with the cutting bowl and the cutting edges.  Bone debris collection compartment\nis located directly below the acetabular reamer.  Bottom of the acetabular reamer has a tool driver opening, which is concentric with the cutting bowl.  The driver opening engages with the shaft, which drives the acetabular reamer.  This form of\nattachment of the shaft with the acetabular reamer does not ensure alignment of axis of the shaft with that of the acetabular reamer.  The acetabular reamer is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,755,719 to Frieze, et al. discloses an acetabular reamer.  This acetabular reamer includes a base, a first set of semi-circular blades attached to the base, and a second set of semi-circular blades also contacting said base,\nand crossing and intersecting with said first set of blades at right angles thereto.  The base preferably comprises a circular plate having a hexagonal drive hole in the center thereof and a plurality of slots in the periphery thereof for anchoring the\nblades.  Each semi-circular blade includes a first end having a projection thereon, a second end opposite from said first end and also having a projection thereon, a first edge having serrated cutting teeth thereon, a second edge opposite from said first\nedge, and a first and second side surface.  The cutting edge of the first set of blades includes a plurality of outwardly facing slots, which mate with and engage a second set of inwardly facing slots in the second edge of said second blades.  When the\nfirst and second set of blades are assembled in this fashion the cutting edges of both sets of blades lie in the same spherical plane.  The projections can comprise snap-in projections that automatically lock in position or projections that can be\ntwisted and locked into position.  Alternatively, the base can comprise a pair of upper and lower plates with apertures in the upper plate such that when the blade projections mate with the apertures, riveting of the lower plate with respect to the upper\nplate locks the projections and their related blades into position on the base.  When the reamer is assembled it has a hemispherical shape suitable for reaming the acetabulum of the hip so that the acetabular portion of a hip implant properly fits into\nthe acetabulum.  The acetabular reamer is an open structure and the bone fragments will migrate back into the cutting zone, since no containment space is formed by the open structure of the cutter blades inserted into the base.  The drive shaft is\ncoupled to a hexagonal aperture in the base plate and this method of attachment does not align the hemispherical cutter centerline with that of the drive shaft resulting in the wobbliness of the cutter in the bone cavity.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,976,144 to Fishbein et al. discloses a hollow dome reamer with removable teeth.  This surgical reamer has a hollow dome with apertures spaced apart arranged in arcs extending from an apex of the dome to the base portion of the\ndome.  Removable teeth are positioned in the apertures.  Each cutting tooth has a flange that is aligned flush with the external surface of the dome, and a raised cutting edge extending above the flange and the external surface of the dome.  An interior\npassageway communicates between the outside and inside of the dome.  A base plate is removably secured on the base portion of the dome to provide closure of the central cavity of the dome.  A perspective view of the cutter of the reamer is shown\nhereinbelow on the left; a perspective view of the reamer with removable, replaceable cutters is shown herein on the right.  The base plate is secured to the dome by retaining springs.  A drive shaft is connected to the base plate through an aperture in\nthe base plate and held in place by a spring.  The surgical reamer has a hollow dome with apertures spaced apart appointed to receive removable teeth positioned therein.  Although the teeth are removable, they are not disposable in nature; the teeth are\nremoved for replacement or for re-sharpening and are used again.  The dome is connected to a base plate, which is further connected to a shaft member and retained by a spring clip and an interlocking latch.  There is no direct attachment of the shaft to\nthe dome and this multitude of connections to the shaft does not assure that the centerline of the shaft coincides with that of the hollow dome.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,980,170 to Salyer as well as U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,817,096, 5,501,686, 5,282,804, 5,236,433, 5,171,313, 5,171,312 disclose a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is\nsecured at one of said shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool collate is secured at the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be\npositioned.  The boss has a distal end surface with a groove therein.  Both the groove and the distal end surface extend transversely of the axis.  A pin is positioned in the groove on the axis.  A latch mechanism is provided to hold a mounting bar of a\nrotary tool in the groove on the pin, whereby the rotary tool is held exactly coaxially of the driver during use.  The rotary tool, which is used with the driver has a bar which has the same dimensions as the groove in the boss of the tool driver of the\ninvention.  The bar thus fills the slot and is complementary to the slot.  The bar has a hole therein which is complementary to the pin.  The pin extends coaxially of the shaft and the boss.  The bar hole in which the pin of the tool driver is positioned\nis precisely coaxial of the axis of the tool about which the cutting edges are precisely positioned.  The tool driver has a shaft appointed to receive acetabular reamer cups and patella cutters.  The cutters are appointed to be connected to the tip of\nthe shaft by means of mounting bar in the cutter and a slot in the shaft secured by a complementary pin.  This method of attachment using a mounting bar that slides into a slot clearly does not align the centerline of the shaft and that of the reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,168,600 to Grace, et al discloses an acetabular reamer backing plate and method of use.  This backing plate is for an acetabular reamer assembly that allows for the attachment of a reamer driver.  The acetabular reamer assembly\ncomprises a cutting cup and backing plate, the cutting cup having an external surface with cutting teeth formed therein and having an internal surface, the cutting cup terminating in a peripheral edge.  The rigid backing plate has a planar surface, which\nterminates in an outer circumferential edge, the outer circumferential edge being coupled to the peripheral bottom edge of the cutting cup, the rigid plate also having an internal edge profile.  The internal edge profile of the rigid backing plate has at\nleast two finger elements protruding from the outer circumferential edge thereof towards a central vertical axis drawn perpendicular to the planar surface of the plate.  Further, the finger elements of the backing plate form a holding opening for a\nreamer driver.  The internal edge profile of the backing plate forms at least one observation opening in addition to the holding opening to allow bone fragments forming within the acetabular reamer to be visually inspected while the reamer is in use. \nThe finger elements terminate to form a contact surface to make firm contact with the driver when inserted in the holding opening.  The contact surface can be simple or complex.  Further, the internal edge profile is continuous so that the machining\nprocess for the backing plate is simplified.  The acetabular backing plate is welded or mechanically attached to the spherical reamer and the shaft is connected to the backing plate via a slidable attachment.  Due to the clearance at the sliding\ninterface, the centerline of the spherical reamer need not coincide with that of the drive shaft and the cutting action can be wobbly.  The welded spherical reamer is not indicated to be a disposable spherical hollow reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,409,732 to Salyer discloses a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is secured at one of the shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool\ncollate is secured to the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be positioned.  The boss is equipped with a securing device of the bayonet type having a latch\nmechanism, which holds the rotary tool on the boss coaxially of the driver during use.  The securing device has a tapered bore extending from the distal end of the boss axially of the shaft.  The rotary tool has a diametrical bar extending across a\nbottom tool driver opening with a centrally located circular disk therein.  The disk of the rotary tool fits within the bore of the tool shaft boss so as to concentrically locate the rotary tool and the tool shaft on the same axis.  The latch mechanism\nholds the tool driver and the tool together in this position, whereby rotary tools of a multitude of sizes can be secured concentrically to the tool shaft without holding a plurality of critical tolerances when machining the bayonet type securing device\nor the rotary tool bottom bar.  The tool driver is a shaft with a slot on the end that receives the acetabular reamer.  It deals with the details of the device for attaching the acetabular reamer to the shaft.  This type of slotted attachment does not\nresult in coaxial mounting of the reamer that is coincident with the centerline of the shaft, even though the different components of the shaft are said to be coaxially aligned.  The reamer is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,730,094 to Salyer et al. discloses cutting edges for reamers and a method for making same.  Each reamer has a plurality of cutters spirally arranged on reamer surface.  Each cutter has a continuous cutting edge.  Edges may be\ngenerally straight in planes perpendicular to the reamer surface or tangential or parallel to the tangential plane with respect to the reamer surface.  Cutting edges may also be curved in planes perpendicular to the reamer surface or parallel or\ntangential to the reamer surface.  Further, the curvature may be convex, or concave or of other complex shapes.  There need be no relationship between the shape of cutting edges and the shape of reamer surface.  In fact, one may be curved and the other\nstraight, or both may be curved in the same or opposite directions.  These relate to the edge geometry of the cutting edges of the reamer.  As explicitly stated in the summary, "It is also an advantage of the invention to provide a new and improved\nreamer that can be stripped in the field and sterilized for re-use, and which does not have crevices and other structures to hold bone chips and tissue which cannot be easily dislodged prior to sterilization", the reamer is intended to be reused after\nsterilization and is not a disposable spherical reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,875,217 to Wolford discloses an orthopedic reamer assembly.  This orthopedic reamer assembly includes a reamer with a generally hemispherical shell having a concave side and at least one attachment feature associated with the\nconcave side.  A driver is attachable to the reamer and has a shaft with a reamer end.  A releasable collar is disposed on the reamer end, which includes a boss having at least one retaining pin.  A sleeve is fitted over the boss and includes a groove\nthat is proximate to a corresponding retaining pin.  The reamer has a cavity in the reamer end with a biasing element.  The biasing element biases the sleeve in a closed position respective to the boss.  A release pin, which press fits into the sleeve is\nprovided in the reamer end, and is conveyed through the cavity, with the biasing element biasing against the release pin.  The orthopedic reamer assembly is a complicated attachment of design of the drive shaft to an acetabular reamer with multiple\nsliding parts.  Since each of the sliding parts requires a sliding fit, there are inherent displacement possibilities and therefore, the centerline of the shaft is not reliably aligned with the centerline of the acetabular reamer.  Moreover, the\nacetabular reamer is not indicated to be a disposable spherical hollow reamer and has complicated machined elements for sliding fit.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0181916 to Wolford discloses an orthopedic reamer with flat cutting teeth.  This orthopedic reamer is for cutting bone and includes a shaft and a head coupled with the shaft.  The head includes a\ndistal face with a plurality of cutting teeth.  Each cutting tooth includes a hole extending through the head.  At least a portion of each hole has a substantially round perimeter.  A raised lip is positioned adjacent to and extends around at least part\nof the substantially round portion.  The \'916 publication discloses an orthopedic reamer with flat cutting teeth having a shaft attached to acetabular reamer cups.  The reamer cups of the \'916 publication are not disposable in nature.  The orthopedic\nreamer with flat cutting teeth publication does not provide a spherical hollow reamer assembly including a space for capturing bone fragments or bone cement debris.  The attachment of the acetabular reamer to the drive shaft includes a complicated\nmechanism and does not reliably align the centerline of the drive shaft with that of the acetabular reamer and therefore wobble free rotation is not provided.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0095041 to Fehlbaum et al. discloses contoured reamer teeth and method for their manufacture.  An acetabular reamer has a cutting shell having a series of doubly curved cutting teeth of a quantity to\nsubstantially reduce a cutting pressure on each tooth as well as to reduce a size of a typical chip generated upon cutting.  Substantially all the teeth each have a matched arc cutting edge of substantial length that has a cutting profile which\nsubstantially matches a profile of a shape to be cut.  The apertures in which the cutting edges are formed have at least one flat edge by which a punch, used in the process of forming the edge may be oriented.  Such a configuration reduces the number of\nteeth required to cut the shape.  The contoured reamer teeth publication does not provide a reaming assembly.  In addition, the contoured reamer teeth are not disposable in nature, and therefore over time will become dulled, thereby causing enhanced\nfriction during reaming and potentially damaging the bone.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 006/0235539 to Blunn et al. discloses a surgical kit for hemiarthroplasty hip replacement.  This kit comprises a femoral head and reamer.  The kit is suited for performing a hip hemiarthroplasty, in which\na femoral head is fitted directly into a socket reamed into the acetabular without any permanent liner or prosthetic acetabular being implanted.  The reamer is used to ream out the acetabulum until cancellous bone is exposed so that it bleeds liquid\ncontaining stem cells.  By selecting the size of the femoral head in accordance with the characteristics of the patient, the pressure imposed on the liquid/synovial fluid of the joint is in the range between 0.5 and 2 MPa This causes the stem cells to\nproduce new cartilage between the bone and femoral head.  The surgical kit for hip replacement utilizes a spherical head with elements for reaming a socket in an acetabulum.  The spherical shape of reamer provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate\nshape of the bone joints.  The surgical kit disclosed by the \'539 publication is provided for multiple use, and therefore the tool will become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  Significantly, the\n\'539 publication does not teach a disposable spherical hollow surgical reamer tool that is attached to a drive shaft with coincident centerlines.\n Foreign Publication No. WO 9007908 to Schelhas discloses an acetabulum reamer.  Acetabulum reamer for reaming the acetabulum of the human pelvic bone prior to insertion of an artificial hip joint cup comprises a reamer head on a shaft and a\nspiral reaming ridge arranged about the axis of the shaft and provided with reaming devices.  The outer edge of the reaming ridge is delimited by a section of a spherical surface whose axis of rotation is flush with the axis of the shaft.  The acetabulum\nreamer utilizes a spherical head for reaming a socket in an acetabulum.  The spherical shape of reamer provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the bone joints.  The reamer is provided for multiple use, and therefore the tool will become\nless efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  Significantly, the acetabulum reamer publication does not teach a disposable spherical hollow surgical reamer tool that is attached to a drive shaft with\ncoincident centerlines.\n There remains a need in the art for a modular easy-to-assemble spherical hollow reamer for medical applications having a disposable spherical hollow cutter.  Also needed in the art is a disposable spherical hollow cutter assembly of the type\ndescribed, which can be attached concentric to a reusable shaft portion that provides means for reaming of an acetabular bone cavity in bones without any wobbly movement.  Further needed in the art is a cutter assembly having means for collecting bone\ndebris and keeping the collected debris displaced from the cutting portion, so that heat generated at the bone cutting surface is minimized.  After one use of the spherical hollow reamer a new spherical hollow cutter with sharp fresh cutting edges can be\nutilized and the old hollow cutter can be discarded.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a modular easy-to-assemble spherical hollow reamer for medical applications having a disposable spherical reamer concentrically attached to a reusable shaft portion.  The attachment between the disposable spherical\nhollow reamer and the reusable shaft is accomplished by a precision threaded screw attachment.  The disposable spherical hollow reamer has in its interior a central precision machined screw member which threads directly into a threaded aperture at the\ndistal end of the reusable shaft.  These threads typically have 40 threads per inch, preferably ACME threads similar to that present in a precision micrometer.  Since these threads are formed during the machining of the shaft and machining of the\nspherical hollow reamer, their centerlines are precisely aligned when the spherical hollow reamer is threaded into the distal end of the reusable shaft.  Thus, when the proximal end of the reusable shaft is inserted into a drilling machine and the shaft\nis rotated, the disposable spherical hollow reamer rotates without any wobbliness and reams or cuts a precise bone cavity replicating the shape of the spherical hollow reamer.\n Cutting teeth and bone fragment discharging apertures are provided on the outer surface of the spherical hollow cutter.  The reusable shaft has an integral or user-attachable plate that encloses a volume within the spherical hollow reamer.  In\ncombination, the plate and reusable shaft provide a space for accumulation of bone debris or bone cement debris.  The quick removal of bone fragments or bone cement debris reduces the amount of heat generated during the cutting/reaming procedure. \nGraduations are provided in the reusable shaft portion to determine the depth of insertion of the spherical hollow reamer into the bone cavity.\n Generally stated, the Hollow Spherical Reamer for Medical Applications broadly comprises: (i) a reusable shaft portion having a threaded distal end, a proximal end for coupling with a drilling machine and a central region for a plate; (ii) a\ndisposable spherical reamer portion with a plurality of cutting teeth and apertures for discharging bone and bone cement fragments; (iii) said disposable hollow reamer having a precisely machined screw element at the interior central location for\nattachment of the hollow spherical reamer to the reusable shaft distal end; (iv) said central region of the reusable shaft having a user attachable or integrally attached plate for creating a space within the hollow spherical reamer for collecting bone\ndebris or bone cement debris; and (v) said proximal region of the reusable shaft having a coupling portion for attachment to a drilling device.\n The modular spherical hollow reamer of the present invention solves the problems associated with the prior art reamers.  In accordance with the present invention, the modular spherical hollow reamer for medical applications has an\neasy-to-assemble disposable hollow spherical reamer, which can be attached to a reusable shaft that allows for a fresh reamer to be used with each new application of the reamer.  The modular spherical hollow reamer of the present invention transfers\nshaft torque reliably while at the same time maintains the centerline of the spherical reamer preventing wobbliness thereof during cutting.  Bone and bone cement fragments are collected and stored away from the bone cutting area thereby reducing the\npossibility of bone fragment incorporation into living bone tissue.  The modular spherical hollow reamer gradually crates the acetabular bone cavity or resizes an existing acetabular bone cavity, thereby reducing heat during its surgical usage.  Owing to\nthe presence of these features, the modular spherical hollow reamer of this invention is safer to use and operates more efficiently than prior art reamers.\n The Spherical Hollow Reamer Assembly is adapted to be utilized when preparing bone cavities that receive acetabular cups in a close fitting configuration with precise cavity geometry.  The cavities may be prepared from a previously prepared bone\ncavity in which the acetabular cup has come loose and has to be replaced.  In this case, the bone cavity is enlarged and the bone cement previously used has to be completely reamed out and removed.  The Spherical Hollow Reamer Assembly may also be used\nto create a bone cavity on a bone section that has no previously installed acetabular cup.  The spherical hollow reamer is disposable, so that the cutting performance of the device is not compromised through repeated use.  Several of the clinical\nproblems encountered with conventional reamers are overcome through utilization of the Spherical Hollow Reamers Assembly.  Novel design features of the Spherical Hollow Reamer Assembly and improvements to conventional reamers are multifaceted, and\ninclude a reusable shaft with a precision threaded distal end adapted to receive a disposable, single-use spherical hollow reamer portion with a corresponding precision threaded central screw providing a center line aligned wobble free attachment of the\nreamer.  The threading on the distal end of the shaft and the mating screw element have counter clockwise thread that do not loosen under the clockwise rotation imparted by the drilling machine.  The spherical hollow reamer portion is discarded after a\nsingle use to ensure a sharp cutter for use in surgery.  Moreover, when dealing with revision acetabular cup surgery, spherical hollow reamers have also been designed to cut bone cement [Polymethylmethacrylate (Acrylic) or PMMA] in a more efficient\nmanner by providing internal space to capture the debris.  This reduces both the cutting temperature and time required to remove the remnant cement mantle.  Each of these features operates to decrease heat to the bone and reduce operating room time\nrequired for acetabular cup revision surgery.

These procedures include hip replacement and shoulder replacement and the like.  Reaming of the bone cavities for the placement of an acetabular cup requires milling\nof precisely shaped bone cavity.  When the acetabular cup is fixed by interference, this precision is more critical than when the acetabular cup is bonded to the bone cavity by a cement composition.  The standard procedure for preparing a bone cavity for\nacetabular cup insertion is illustrated in FIG. 1 at 10.  The bone cavity 11 is milled by a solid reamer 12, which is generally used many times until the teeth of the spherical reamer becomes dull.  Due to the presence of debris in the cutting area, the\nbone surface is subject to over heating and bone tissue degradation.  Bone cement fragments may become included into living bone tissue creating bone healing problems.\n The invention herein provides spherical hollow reamers appointed for use in medical applications.  The spherical hollow reamers are disposable, so that the cutting performance is not compromised through repeated use.  Several improvements\ntowards the clinical problems seen with conventional reamers are overcome through utilization of the hollow reamers herein.  Novel design features of the hollow reamer herein and improvements to conventional reamers are multifaceted and include a\nreusable shaft with supporting structure to precisely align a disposable, single-use spherical hollow reamer portion.  The hollow reamer portion is discarded after a single use to ensure a sharp cutter for use in surgery.  Moreover, when dealing with\nrevision hip surgery, the hollow reamers have also been designed to cut bone cement (PMMA) in a more efficient manner by providing an internal space to capture the bone cement debris and thereby reducing both the cutting temperature and time required to\nremove the remnant cement mantle.  Both these features are important in reducing heat to the bone and reducing operating room time required for revision surgery.\n While FIG. 1 illustrates conventional reamers currently utilized, FIG. 2 illustrates at 20 a photograph the disposable Spherical Hollow Tapered Reamer assembly of the present invention.  The spherical hollow reamer assembly comprises at 21 a\nreusable shaft portion with central plate features 22 and a disposable spherical hollow reamer portion at 23.  The central plate 22 shown here is integrally attached to the reusable shaft portion 23.\n FIG. 3 illustrates at 30 the design features of the spherical hollow reamer assembly, wherein a disposable spherical reamer 23 with a precision threaded aperture centrally located 24 engages with a reusable shaft 21 that has a threaded screw 25\nat the distal end.  The threads are preferably left handed so that right handed rotation of the shaft by the drill during reaming does not loosen the screwed connection between the disposable spherical hollow reamer and the reusable shaft.  The spherical\nhollow reamer 23 has plurality of cutting elements 26 and plurality of apertures 27 that go through the thickness of the disposable hollow reamer 23.  A central plate 22 is provided on the shaft, which may be integrally attached to the reusable shaft or\nattached manually by the user and provides a space for collecting bone fragments or bone cement debris.\n FIG. 4A, FIG. 4B and FIG. 4C, illustrates views of the first embodiment of the invention depicting at 40 the modular design of the spherical hollow reamer assembly that provides a reusable reamer shaft and a disposable spherical hollow reamer. \nThe invention includes a reusable shaft 21 that is provided with an integral plate and has a threaded screw at its distal end, which engages with a precision threaded aperture 25 located at the center of the inner surface of the spherical hollow reamer. \nThe plate portion at the central region of the reusable shaft has a taper 28 along its periphery, which engages with the interior surface of the disposable spherical hollow reamer forming a bone fragment and bone cement debris capture volume 29.  The\ndisposable spherical reamer is available in the size range from 36 mm to 80 mm in 1 mm size increments.  Corresponding shafts are also provided.  The disposable spherical hollow reamers have a thickness generally in the range of 0.125 mm to 0.812 mm\n(0.005\'\' to 0.032\'\').\n FIG. 5 illustrates the second embodiment of the invention depicting at 50 a reusable shaft identical to that shown in FIG. 4, but adapted to engage with three different diameters of disposable spherical hollow reamers.  Due to the fixed diameter\nof the plate provided on the central region of the reusable shaft, the spherical hollow reamer inner surface is engaged at a different location along the axis of the spherical hollow reamer still forming a bone fragment or bone cement debris capturing\nvolume.\n FIG. 6 illustrates at 60 the third embodiment of the invention depicting at 60 a reusable shaft that engages with plurality of user-attached plates 61, 62 and 63 having different dimensions.  As the threaded aperture 25 of the central portion of\nthe disposable spherical hollow reamer engages with the reusable shaft 21, of different sizes, it engages with an appropriately sized central plate.  This requires the threads to be inserted at different depths as indicated by the arrow shown.\n FIG. 7 illustrates at 70 the fourth embodiments of the modular design for the spherical hollow reamer assembly that provides a reusable reamer shaft and a disposable spherical hollow reamer.  It includes a single reusable shaft 21 that has an\nexpansion feature 71 that expands in size to fit with all disposable spherical hollow reamers 23, which range from 36 mm to 80 mm with 1 mm size increments.  The disposable spherical hollow reamer has holes 73 through the wall of the reamer to inserts\nscrews that engage the expandable portion of the reusable shaft.  The distal end of the expandable portion closes the spherical hollow reamer providing a closed space 74 in which bone fragments or bone cement debris accumulates.\n FIG. 8 illustrates a photograph of family of disposable spherical hollow reamers ranging in diameter from 36 mm to 80 mm in 1 mm increment.  The family of disposable reamers addresses a wide range of bone cavity sizes, adapted to fit with\ncorresponding reusable shafts.\n In all these embodiments, the disposable spherical hollow reamer portion is provided with plurality of cutting teeth on its outer surface and a plurality of apertures for disposing bone fragments and bone cement fragments away from the reamed\narea thereby reducing the heat generated at the cutting interface.  The spherical hollow reamer is discarded after a single use to ensure a sharp, efficient cutter for every surgery.  In each of these different embodiments, the disposable spherical\nhollow reamer is attached to the reusable shaft using a precisely machined screw thread that engages into a corresponding threaded hole in the distal end of the reusable shaft.  The reusable shaft has a plate in the central region that encloses the\ninterior of the spherical hollow reamer creating an enclosed space that captures and retain the bone fragments or bone cement debris that is discharged through the apertures adjacent to the cutters on the outer surface of the spherical hollow reamer. \nThe spherical hollow reamer assembly provides a space for bone debris offering multiple benefits.  These benefits include reducing heat generated during cutting by removing the bone debris from the outer surface of the cutter to the inside of the cutter\nand providing space for bone debris to be collected and later removed for bone grafting for the specific surgical procedure.  The space for bone fragment accumulation is in the area between the spherical hollow reamer and the central plate provided on\nthe reusable shaft.\n The key features of the spherical hollow assembly for medical applications include, in combination, the components set forth below: a) a reusable shaft portion having an elongated body with a proximal end, a distal end, and a central plate\nportion; b) said proximal end having a coupling portion for attachment of said reusable shaft to a drilling device; c) said distal end having a precision threaded central screw for receiving a precision threaded screw; d) said central portion having a\nconical plate that is user attachable or permanently mounted on the reusable shaft portion; and e) a disposable spherical hollow reamer portion having an outer surface with a plurality of cutting teeth and a plurality of apertures for discharging bone or\nbone cement fragments and a an inner surface with a centrally located machined projection with precision threaded aperture; whereby the screwed attachment of said disposable spherical hollow reamer to the reusable shaft distal end aligns their\ncenterlines preventing wobbliness during reaming, creating precise bone cavities that replicate the shape of the disposable spherical hollow reamer in a medical procedure, and the central portion plate in combination with the spherical hollow reamer\nforms a containment volume for capturing bone fragment or bone cement fragment.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

 'patent_description': u'FIELD\n The disclosed technology relates generally to a joint prosthesis.  More specifically, the disclosure relates to a joint prosthesis comprising one or more hollow segmented posts and a method of implanting the same.\nBACKGROUND\n Joint implants have been designed to replace articular surfaces of many human and animal joints.  These implants include replacements for hip, knee, elbow, shoulder, ankle, and other joints.  Prosthetic joint implants generally must both replace\nthe bearing surface of the joint for motion and provide some method of fixing the implant to the bone.\n Conventional methods of fixing the implant to the bone has been accomplished by two primary methods: bone cement (e.g., PMMA) or bone ingrowth through porous surfaces (biologic fixation).  Bone cement is mixed in the operating room and injected\ninto the preparation sites for the implants.  The strength of a joint implant\'s fixation using bone cement is at a maximum shortly after implantation (usually after around 24 hours).  Over time, the cement can fatigue and break down, leading to loosening\nand wear of the implants.\n Biologic fixation for prostheses eliminates the need for cement and possibly avoids the long term complications associated with cement fixation.  Conventional biologic fixation methods include fixation through a porous surface created by layers\nof sintered beads, plasma sprayed surface, titanium wire, and other micro and macro surfaces providing for a mechanical lock with bone.  Bone ingrowth within the first 10-12 weeks after surgery essentially determines whether the implant will be stable\nlong term.  In order to be successful, the porous surfaces or macro surfaces must be well designed for bone attachment and the implant must be very stable during this early post-operative time period.  If there is too much motion between the implant and\nthe bone, a fibrous tissue interface will occur rather than bone ingrowth.  Should that happen, the long term success will be in jeopardy as loosening due to pain and micromotion can create a need for revision.\n For stability to be consistently achieved during the preparation of the bones for the implant insertion, very precise instruments and very consistent surgical techniques are required.  In many cases this cannot consistently be achieved due to\nmany variables including surgeon error, worn instruments, and patient issues.  In some cases, discovery of a problem may come after insertion of the implant.  For example, during surgery, after the bones have been prepared for biologic fixation, trial\nimplants placed and evaluated, and the final implants selected and inserted into their corresponding preparations, the surgeon may discover that the patient\'s joint is not suitable for biologic fixation.\n However, addressing these problems usually requires removing the implant and/or attempting further preparation to the bony beds.  Different bone preparation techniques are required for cement fixation, and thus switching from one method to the\nother mid-surgery typically requires removing the implant and essentially starting over from the beginning.  Further, conventional joint implants are subject to post-operative loosening due to, for example, inadequate stability due to initial patient\nactivity.  There thus remains a need for an improved joint implant that can address these and other disadvantages in the prior art joint implants and implantation methods.\nSUMMARY\n Disclosed are embodiments of an improved joint prosthesis that can provide the option to improve initial stability without removing the implant or altering the preparation.  Embodiments of joint implant components can include one or more hollow\nsegmented posts positioned on one or more bone fixation surfaces.  The segmented posts can include a central opening configured to receive cement for initial stability of the implant.  Cement can be injected at the time of implantation, at a time after\nimplantation (e.g., during later revision surgery), or not at all.  The segmented posts can be expandable to form or increase a press fit within a bore or hole drilled in the patient\'s bone, thereby further increasing stability of the implant in some\nembodiments.\n One embodiment of a joint implant component comprises a bone-engaging or bone fixation surface configured to engage with a patient\'s bone and at least one post (e.g., a fixation post) protruding outwardly from the bone fixation surface.  The\npost can comprise at least two segments, each segment being separated by a gap, and the segments can define a central opening through the centers of said segments.  Thus, the post can be a hollow segmented post.  The segments of each fixation post can be\nsubstantially aligned with one another.\n In some embodiments, the at least one post comprises at least a first and second post protruding from the bone fixation surface, the first and second posts being positioned on opposite portions of the joint implant from each other.  The first\nand second posts can be positioned substantially parallel to one another in some specific embodiments.  At least one post can be positioned tangentially to the bone fixation surface, substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the joint implant,\nand/or transversely to a major axis of the joint implant.  The segments of each post can be positioned relative to one another such that they are configured to receive a cement injection needle within the central opening through the segments.\n In some embodiments, the joint implant can comprise at least a first implant member and a second implant member, the first and second implant members being configured to articulate with each other (e.g., the joint implant can be a\nbicompartmental joint implant).  Unicompartmental and tricompartmental joint implants are also disclosed.  In embodiments with more than one implant component, the first implant member can comprise a first bone fixation surface and the second implant\nmember can comprise a second bone fixation surface, and both the first and second bone fixation surfaces can comprise at least one post protruding from said first and second bone fixation surfaces.  In some embodiments, each segment of the fixation post\nis substantially C-shaped.\n Some embodiments of joint prostheses include porous surfaces.  For example, at least part of one fixation post can include a porous surface (e.g., a porous coating).  In some embodiments, at least a portion of the bone fixation surface comprises\na porous coating.  For example, portions of the bone fixation surface between fixation posts can comprise a porous coating or treatment.\n The fixation posts can be configured to be expandable from a first position to a second position, wherein the diameter of the central opening is increased in the second position with respect to the first position.  Such expansion can contribute\nto initial implant stability within a patient\'s bone by increasing the press fit between the post and a hole drilled in the patient\'s bone.\n Disclosed concepts can be applied to any type of joint implant prosthesis.  For example, any of the following specific implant components can be provided with one or more hollow, expandable fixation posts according to the present disclosure: an\nelbow implant component, an acetabular cup, a femoral hip stem, a shoulder humeral stem, a femoral knee implant component, a tibial knee implant component, or an ankle tibial implant component.  Of course this list is non-exhaustive, and any other type\nof joint implant or implant component can include one or more fixation posts according to the present disclosure.\n One embodiment of a joint implant component comprises a post portion configured to engage with a patient\'s bone, the post portion comprising a plurality of segments positioned around the circumference of the post portion and spaced apart by a\nplurality of longitudinal slits extending along at least a portion of the length of the post portion.  The joint implant component can also comprise a taper portion coupled to the post portion, wherein the post portion and taper portion are arranged such\nthat a longitudinal central opening extends through the post portion and taper portion.  The segments of the post portion can be expandable from a first configuration to an expanded configuration.  The diameter of the central opening can be increased in\nthe expanded configuration with respect to the first configuration.\n The segments can be positioned relative to one another such that they are configured to receive a cement injection needle within the central opening.  In some embodiments, at least a part of the post portion can have a porous surface.  One\nspecific embodiment of a joint implant component comprises a femoral hip stem.\n In some embodiments, the taper portion can comprise internal threads within the central opening.  Such threads can be configured to engage with a threaded expansion tool that can be used to expand the post portion from the first configuration to\nthe expanded configuration.\n Some embodiments can comprise a curved annular portion positioned between the taper portion and the post portion, wherein the curved annular portion is configured to engage with a surface of a patient\'s bone.\n Methods of implant fixation are also disclosed.  Disclosed methods can provide the opportunity for establishing initial biologic fixation (bone ingrowth), and can also provide an adjunct fixation through injecting cement down the center of the\npost if initial stability is not achieved or is questionable.\n One method of replacing at least part of a patient\'s joint with one or more joint implant components can comprise preparing the implant site to receive the one or more joint implant components and implanting the joint prosthesis wherein at least\na portion of the implant component is positioned at least partially within a hole drilled into a patient\'s bone, wherein the joint implant component comprises a bone fixation surface and at least one segmented post protruding from the bone fixation\nsurface, and wherein the post comprises at least two segments, each segment being separated by a gap, and wherein the segments define a central opening through the center of said segments.\n Some methods can comprise expanding the at least one segmented post from a first configuration to a second configuration, wherein the diameter of the central opening is increased in the second configuration with respect to the first\nconfiguration.  In some embodiments, expanding the at least one segmented post can comprise drawing a tapered expansion tool through at least part of the segmented post.\n Some methods can comprise evaluating whether biologic fixation is suitable as the sole fixation method at the time of implantation, and injecting cement into the central opening.  For example, an implant site can be prepared for biologic\nfixation, and disclosed embodiments of joint implant components can be implanted at the site.  If it is determined that biologic fixation is not suitable for that patient, conventional methods would require removal of the implant, and re-preparation of\nthe implant site for cement fixation.  Disclosed methods, on the other hand, can allow for use of bone cement without requiring removal of the implant component or further alteration of the implant site.\n In some methods, the joint replacement can be completed and a follow up evaluation some time after completion of the joint replacement can be conducted to determine whether the joint prosthesis is sufficiently stable.  Cement can be injected\ninto the central opening, for example, at a time after initial implantation.  For example, if a follow-up evaluation reveals that bone ingrowth has been insufficient for long-term implant stability, revision surgery can be conducted to increase fixation\nof the implant within the patient\'s bone.  In some embodiments, cement can be injected into one or more of the hollow segmented posts.  In some embodiments, fibrous growth may need to be removed from the fixation posts before cement can be injected.\n The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.

Additionally, the term "includes" means "comprises." Although the operations of\nexemplary embodiments of the disclosed method may be described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation, it should be understood that the disclosed embodiments can encompass an order of operations other than the particular,\nsequential order disclosed.  For example, operations described sequentially may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently.  Further, descriptions and disclosures provided in association with one particular embodiment are not limited to that\nembodiment, and may be applied to any embodiment disclosed herein.  Moreover, for the sake of simplicity, the attached figures may not show the various ways in which the disclosed system, method, and apparatus can be used in combination with other\nsystems, methods, and apparatuses.\n To address the problems discussed above with conventional joint prostheses, the present disclosure concerns a joint prosthesis designed to facilitate bone ingrowth (e.g., designed to be secured within a patient\'s joint via biologic fixation),\nand yet is also designed to facilitate cement fixation, either at the time of initial implantation, or some time after implantation.  Disclosed joint prostheses and methods enable a surgeon to prepare a treatment site for biologic fixation, insert a\njoint prosthesis, and evaluate whether biologic fixation seems appropriate for the particular patient.  If the surgeon determines at this stage in surgery that cement fixation is necessary, a surgeon using a conventional joint prosthesis would be\nrequired to remove the prosthesis, re-prepare the treatment site, and begin again.  On the other hand, a surgeon using one of the presently disclosed joint prostheses and methods would advantageously be able to inject cement into the joint prosthesis\nwithout needing to remove the implant or alter the bone preparation already completed.  In this manner, disclosed embodiments of joint prostheses can allow a surgeon to adapt to individual patient needs, while potentially shortening the time required for\nsurgery.\n Disclosed embodiments of joint prostheses and methods of using the same can be used with both human and animal joints.  Additionally, the disclosed principles can be applied to any joint prosthesis and are not limited to the specific examples\ndescribed herein.  Unicompartmental, bicompartmental, and tricompartmental joint prostheses can all be designed to include one or more hollow segmented posts, as will be described further.\n By way of illustration, one embodiment of a joint prosthesis in the form of a bicompartmental elbow implant is shown in FIGS. 1-4.  FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of a humeral component 100, and FIG. 2 shows one embodiment of a radioulnar component\n200.  As shown in FIG. 3 (which is a simplified representation), the humeral component 100 and the radioulnar component 200 can be configured to interact with one another to form an articulating prosthetic elbow joint 400, which is shown implanted in\nFIG. 4.\n In the example shown in FIGS. 1-4, the humeral component 100 and the radioulnar component 200 each includes two fixation posts 102, 202 protruding outwardly from respective bone-engaging surfaces 104, 204.  While FIGS. 1-4 illustrate each joint\nprosthesis component 100, 200, having two fixation posts, in alternative embodiments, each component 100, 200 may have more or fewer fixation posts.  For example, in one alternative embodiment, a first joint prosthesis component can comprise one or more\nfixation posts, while a second joint prosthesis component can be provided without any fixation posts.  In another specific example, a first joint component can comprise one fixation post and a second joint component can comprise two or more fixation\nposts.  A suitable number of fixation posts can be determined based on the particular joint application and can vary for different designs of joint prostheses.\n Returning to FIGS. 1-4, the humeral component 100 can comprise a bone-engaging surface 104 opposite an articulating surface 106.  The radioulnar component 200 can comprise a bone-engaging surface 204 opposite an articulating surface 206.  As\nshown in FIGS. 3-4, the joint prosthesis 400 is designed such that, when implanted, the articulating surface 106 of the humeral component 100 and the articulating surface 206 of the radioulnar component 200 interact with one another such that the humeral\ncomponent 100 can move with respect to the radioulnar component (e.g., the articulating surfaces 106, 206 slide back and forth against one another), thereby providing joint movement.  The interaction of the humeral component 100 and the radioulnar\ncomponent 200 is shown in FIG. 3, in exploded view.\n The bone-engaging surfaces 104, 204 each can engage with a bone at the implantation site.  In the particular example shown in FIGS. 1-4 (and as best seen in FIG. 4), the bone-engaging surface 104 engages with a humerus 408 and the bone-engaging\nsurface 204 engages with the radius and/or ulna 410.  In other embodiments (e.g., with other types of joint implants according to the present disclosure), the bone engaging surfaces can engage with different bones, as determined by the particular joint\nthe joint implant is designed to replace.\n The bone-engaging surfaces 104, 204 can comprise one or more portions configured to encourage bone growth.  For example, central portion 112 and edge portions 114 of the humeral component 100, as well as portion 216 of the radioulnar component\n200 can comprise a porous coating.  In some embodiments, only a portion of the bone-engaging surfaces 104, 204 is treated with such porous coatings.  In some embodiments, substantially all of the bone-engaging surfaces 104, 204 are treated with one or\nmore porous coatings.  In some embodiments, at least a portion of the surfaces of one or more fixation posts 102, 202 can include one or more porous coatings.  Examples of suitable porous coatings are shown in FIGS. 11-14 and include a plasma spray\nporous surface (FIG. 11), a sintered bead porous surface (FIG. 12), a fiber metal porous surface (FIG. 13), and a porous tantalum structure with interconnected porosity (FIG. 14).\n One or more fixation posts 102, 202 can be positioned on the bone-engaging surfaces 104, 204 of joint components 100, 200.  Humeral component 100 can include two fixation posts 102 positioned on the bone-engaging surface 104.  In some\nembodiments, as shown in FIG. 1, the two fixation posts 102 can be positioned substantially parallel to one another, adjacent opposite ends 118, 120 of the humeral component 100.  The posts 102, 202 can protrude outwardly from the bone-engaging surface\n104, 204 and each can be formed of at least two substantially aligned segments 122, 222, respectively, separated from each other along the bone-engaging surface 104, 204 by respective gaps 124, 224.\n Each segment 122, 222 can be a partially closed segment having two free ends.  For example, each segment 122 can have free ends 121, 123 and each segment 222 can have free ends 221, 223.  Each segment 122, 222 can be, for example, a C-shaped\nstructure integrally formed with or coupled to the bone-engaging surface 104, 204 (e.g., by welding).  In other embodiments, each segment can be, for example, a substantially elliptical, oval, circular (e.g., O-shaped with a small gap between two free\nends), angular, triangular, square, rectangular, V-shaped, or D-shaped structure coupled to the bone-engaging surface of a joint implant component.  Other shapes can also be suitable.\n The segments 122, 222 can be substantially aligned with one another so as to form respective central openings 126, 226 through the centers of the segments 122, 222.  Each central opening 126, 226 can be, for example, a substantially cylindrical\nopening.  Each central opening 126, 226 is discontinuous due to the gaps 124, 224 between adjacent segments 122, 222, but each opening 126, 226 nonetheless can be configured to receive a cylindrical object such as a cement injection needle.  The fixation\nposts 102, 202 and central openings 126, 226 can also be configured to receive ingrowing bone.  For example, bone can grow into the segments 122, 222 between the free ends and/or between the segments (e.g., in gaps 124, 224).  Thus, the humeral and\nradioulnar components 100, 200 and their fixation posts 102, 202 can be configured for biologic fixation and/or for cement fixation.\n The fixation posts 102, 202 can be positioned tangential to the bone-engaging surface 104, 204 in some embodiments.  The orientation of the fixation posts 102 can be at least partially defined with respect to a major axis X and a minor axis Y.\nGenerally, major axis X corresponds to the longest dimension of the joint component, and the minor axis Y is perpendicular to the major axis X. In the case of the humeral component 100 of FIG. 1, the overall cross-sectional shape of the component 100 can\nbe substantially half of an ellipse (e.g., when viewed from the side), and the major axis X passes through foci proximate to opposite ends 118, 120, as well as the center of the implant component 100.  As in FIG. 1, the fixation posts 102 can be\npositioned such that they cross (e.g., are transverse to) the major axis X. In FIG. 1, the fixation posts 102 are positioned substantially parallel to the minor axis Y (e.g., substantially perpendicular to the major axis X).  In other embodiments, the\nfixation posts can be positioned to cross the major axis X at a non-perpendicular angle to the major axis X.\n Fixation posts 102, 202 can be expandable from a first position to a second position, wherein the diameter of the central opening is increased in the second position with respect to the first position, as will be described further below in\nconnection with FIGS. 16-17.  One or more segments 122, 222 of the respective fixation posts 102, 202 can be provided with internal threads (e.g., the surface of the segments 122 facing the central opening 126 can be threaded).\n FIGS. 5-10 show alternative examples of embodiments of joint implants (or joint implant components) that include one or more fixation posts in various positions on the joint implant (e.g., on the bone-engaging surface of one or more joint\nimplant components).  These embodiments are exemplary only, and many other configurations and implant types are possible.\n FIG. 5 shows a prosthetic femoral hip stem 500 having a longitudinal axis Z. The femoral hip stem 500 can include one or more fixation posts 502 positioned on and protruding outwardly from a bone-engaging surface 504.  The fixation posts 502 can\nbe positioned substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis Z in some embodiments.  While only one fixation post 502 is visible in FIG. 5, the femoral hip stem 500 can include one or more additional fixation posts 502 spaced around the implant.\n The fixation post 502 can include at least two substantially aligned segments 522 (e.g., C-shaped segments) separated from each other along the bone-engaging surface 504 by a gap 524.  The segments 522 of a fixation post 502 can define a central\nopening through the centers of the segments 522.  While the embodiment shown in FIG. 5 includes three substantially aligned segments 522, other embodiments can include one or more fixation posts having more or fewer segments.  As with all described\nembodiments, at least a portion of the joint implant 500 (e.g., the bone-engaging surface) and/or at least a portion of the one or more fixation posts 502 can be porous.  For example, at least a portion of the joint implant 500 and/or at least a portion\nof the fixation post 502 can be treated with a porous coating, such as the porous coatings shown in FIGS. 11-14.  Fixation post 502 can be expandable, in accordance with FIGS. 16-17.\n FIG. 6 shows one embodiment of an acetabular cup 600 having a longitudinal axis Z. The acetabular cup 600 can include one or more fixation posts 602 positioned on a bone-engaging surface 604.  The fixation posts 602 can be positioned\nsubstantially parallel to the longitudinal axis Z in some embodiments.  While two fixation posts 602 are visible in FIG. 6, the acetabular cup 600 can include one or more additional fixation posts 602 spaced around the implant.  The fixation posts 602\ncan each include at least two substantially aligned segments 622 (e.g., C-shaped segments) separated from each other along the bone-engaging surface 604 by a gap 624.  The segments 622 of a fixation post 602 can define a central opening through the\nsegments 622.  While the embodiment shown in FIG. 6 includes three substantially aligned segments 622 forming each fixation post 602, other embodiments can include one or more fixation posts having more or fewer segments.  Fixation posts 602 can be\nexpandable, in accordance with FIGS. 16-17.\n FIG. 7 shows one embodiment of a femoral knee implant 700 that can interact with the knee tibial implant 800 of FIG. 8 to form a complete prosthetic knee implant.  Femoral knee implant 700 can include a bone-engaging surface 704 configured to\nengage with a patient\'s femur and one or more fixation posts 702 protruding from the bone-engaging surface 704.  Similarly, the knee tibial implant 800 can include one or more fixation posts 802 protruding from a bone-engaging surface 804 configured to\nengage with a patient\'s tibia.  The fixation posts 702, 802 can each include at least two substantially aligned segments (e.g., C-shaped segments) separated from each other along the bone-engaging surface 704, 804 by a gap.  The segments of a fixation\npost 702, 802 can define a central opening through the segments.  Fixation posts 702, 802 can be expandable, in accordance with FIGS. 16-17.\n FIG. 9 shows a prosthetic shoulder humeral stem 900 having a longitudinal axis Z. The shoulder humeral stem 900 can include one or more fixation posts 902 positioned on and protruding from a bone-engaging surface 904 configured to engage with a\npatient\'s bone (e.g., the humerus).  The fixation posts 902 can be positioned substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis Z in some embodiments.  While only one fixation post 902 is visible in FIG. 9, the shoulder humeral stem 900 can include one or\nmore additional fixation posts 902 spaced around the implant.  The fixation post 902 can include at least two substantially aligned segments 922 (e.g., C-shaped segments) separated from each other along the bone-engaging surface 904 by a gap 924.  While\nthe embodiment shown in FIG. 9 includes four substantially aligned segments 922, other embodiments can include one or more fixation posts having more or fewer segments.  The segments 922 of a fixation post can be arranged to define a central opening\nthrough the segments 922.  Fixation posts 902 can be expandable, in accordance with FIGS. 16-17.\n FIG. 10 shows a prosthetic ankle tibial implant 1000 having a bone-engaging surface 1004 configured to engage with a patient\'s bone (e.g., the tibia).  The bone-engaging surface 1004 can include one or more fixation posts (e.g., hollow,\nsegmented posts) 1002 protruding outwardly from the bone-engaging surface 1004.  The fixation posts 1002 can be formed from two or more adjacent, substantially aligned segments 1022 (e.g., C-shaped segments) separated from each other along the\nbone-engaging surface 1004 by a gap 1024.  Fixation posts 1002 (e.g., segments 1022 of the fixation posts 1002) can be expandable, in accordance with FIGS. 16-17.\n As shown in FIG. 10, a first fixation post 1002 can be positioned near a first edge portion 1018 and a second fixation post 1002 can be positioned near a second edge portion 1020 opposite the first edge portion 1018 of the ankle tibial implant\n1000.  A major axis X and a minor axis Y can be associated with the ankle tibial implant 1000, and one or more of the fixation posts can be positioned to cross (e.g., be positioned transverse to) the major axis X. In the specific embodiment shown in FIG.\n10, the fixation posts are positioned substantially perpendicular to the major axis X, but other arrangements are also suitable.  For example, fixation posts can be positioned at a non-perpendicular angle to the major axis X in some embodiments.\n Fixation posts 1002 each comprise three substantially aligned segments 1022, but in alternative embodiments, the fixation posts 1002 can comprise more or fewer segments.  The fixation posts 1002 can be configured such that the interior of the\nsegments 1022 forms a central opening 1026 (e.g., a substantially cylindrical opening 1026) that can be configured to receive a cylindrical object (e.g., a bone cement injection needle) and/or biologic tissue (e.g., bone ingrowth from the patient\'s\nbone).  The fixation posts 1002 can be positioned tangentially to the bone-engaging surface 1004, with the open portions of the segments 1022 facing outward (e.g., facing away from the bone-engaging surface 1004).  Such arrangements of the segments 1022\nof the fixation posts 1002 can facilitate expansion of the fixation posts 1002, as will be described further below.\n Any of the disclosed embodiments of joint implants having one or more hollow, segmented fixation posts can be configured such that the fixation posts are expandable from an original position to an expanded position.  For example, FIG. 16 shows a\nschematic elevation view of one segment 1622 of a fixation post positioned on a joint implant component 1600, with the fixation post in its original position within a hole 1628 drilled into a patient\'s bone 1630.\n FIG. 17 shows a schematic elevation view of the segment 1622 of a fixation post in its expanded configuration 1622\' within the hole 1628 drilled into a patient\'s bone 1630.  The original position of segment 1622 is shown in FIG. 17 in phantom,\nfor reference.  In expanding the segment 1622\', the free ends 1621\', 1623\' can be moved farther apart from one another than the free ends 1621, 1623 were in the original configuration.  Such expansion of the fixation post segments generally involves\npermanent expansion (e.g., permanent deformation) as opposed to elastic deformation.  In this manner, once the segments 1622 are expanded to an expanded configuration, they generally do not return to their original positions.\n As shown in FIGS. 16-17, by expanding a fixation post (e.g., by expanding some or all of the segments 1622 that form a fixation post), one or more of the expanded segments 1622\' can engage with the patient\'s bone 1630 (e.g., the surface of the\nbone 1630 facing the hole 1628) such as to provide frictional engagement between the segment 1622\' and the bone 1630.  Such frictional engagement can provide further stability for the joint implant component 1600.  Thus, any of the disclosed embodiments\nof fixation posts can increase stability (e.g., fixation) of the joint implant and/or joint implant components.\n While FIG. 16 shows a visible gap between the segment 1622 and the hole 1628, the hole 1628 is generally drilled to provide a press fit engagement with the fixation post, and FIG. 16 shows a gap for clarity, and to emphasize the expansion of the\nsegment 1622.  Thus, expansion of the segments 1622 can increase the strength of the fixation of the joint implant component 1600 to the bone 1630.\n FIG. 18 shows one embodiment of an expansion tool 1836 that can be used to expand segments of a fixation post, such as shown in FIGS. 16-17.  Expansion tool 1836 can comprise a central portion 1838, an enlarged tapered portion 1840, and a\nthreaded portion 1842.  Threaded portion 1842 can be configured to engage with, for example, a thumb screw 1844.  Threaded portion 1842 and central portion 1838 can be configured to fit within the central opening of a fixation post.  A handle portion\n1846 can be provided at one end of the expansion tool 1836, opposite the threaded portion 1842.  The expansion tool 1836 can be long enough that the handle portion 1846 can extend out one end of a fixation post, while at least a portion of the threaded\nportion 1842 can extend out the opposite end of the fixation post.  A thumb screw 1844 or other device can be used to engage with the threaded portion 1842 and turn the expansion tool 1836 so as to pull it at least partially into the central opening of a\nfixation post.  As the expansion tool 1836 is pulled into a fixation post, the enlarged tapered portion 1840 can cause the segments of the fixation post to expand, as the enlarged tapered portion is pulled into the segments, forcing them to expand\noutwardly.  One or more segments of a fixation post can be expanded in this manner, and then the expansion tool 1836 can be removed from the fixation post.  If desired, the expansion tool 1836 can be inserted in the opposite end of the fixation post to\nexpand one or more segments of the other end of the fixation post.  In this manner, one or more the segments on either end of the fixation post can be expanded.  In some embodiments, an expansion tool can expand all of the segments of a fixation post.\n Any other suitable tool or device can also be used to expand one or more segments of one or more fixation posts on a joint implant component in a similar or other fashion.  For example, in one alternative embodiment, the segments can be provided\nwith internal threads that can engage a tapered tool, without the need for a separate thumb screw device as described above.  In other embodiments, a tapered tool can be inserted, such as by a hammer, into the fixation post in order to expand one or more\nsegments.\n FIGS. 19-20 show another embodiment of a joint implant component 1900 comprising one or more hollow segmented fixation posts.  Implant component 1900 is particularly adapted to be a femoral hip implant for example purposes, but the described\nconcepts can be applied to other types of joint implants as well.  While the joint implant embodiments shown in FIGS. 1-10 generally include fixation posts that can be inserted and expanded in a hole tangential to the implant surface, the embodiment of\nFIGS. 19-20 provide a joint implant having an expandable fixation post that can be inserted into a hole that is perpendicular to the osteotomy surface, or inserted into a blind- or through-hole.\n Joint implant component 1900 can include a taper portion 1946 coupled to a post portion 1948, both being substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the implant component 1900.  The post portion 1948 is at least partially inserted in a\npatient\'s bone (and thus is configured to engage with a patient\'s bone), and at least a portion of the taper portion 1946 rests outside of the bone.  Taper portion 1946 can include internal threads 1950 for, by way of example, receiving another joint\nimplant component (e.g., a metal femoral head configured to engage with an acetabulum) and/or for engaging with an expansion tool.  Implant component 1900 can include a curved annular portion 1952 positioned between the taper portion 1946 and the post\nportion 1948.  The curved annular portion 1952 can be configured as a bone-engaging surface configured to engage with a patient\'s bone.  The post portion 1948 can protrude outwardly from the curved annular portion 1952.\n Post portion 1948 can include a plurality of longitudinal slits 1956 positioned between adjacent segments 1954 (e.g., at least a portion of each of the segments 1954 is separated from an adjacent segment 1954 by a gap 1956).  The longitudinal\nslits 1956 can extend along at least a portion of the length of the post portion 1948.  The longitudinal slits 1956 can also provide additional surfaces for bone ingrowth (e.g., bone can grow through the slits 1956 and into the central opening 1958).\n In this manner, the segments 1954 can be positioned around the circumference of the post portion 1948 such that the segments 1954 can define a central opening 1958 through the center of the segments 1954.  The central opening 1958 can be\nconfigured to receive, for example, a cement injection needle.  Longitudinal central opening 1958 can extend through the post portion 1948, taper portion 1946, and curved annular portion 1952.  However, the central opening 1958 need not have a constant\ndiameter through the entire implant component 1900.  For example, the diameter of the central opening 1958 can be larger within the taper portion 1946 than it is within the post portion 1948.\n One or more portions of the joint implant component 1900 can comprise a porous surface, such as one or more of the porous surfaces shown in FIGS. 11-14.  For example, one or more portions of the joint implant component 1900 can comprise a plasma\nspray porous surface (FIG. 11), a sintered bead porous surface (FIG. 12), a fiber metal porous surface (FIG. 13), and/or a porous tantalum structure with interconnected porosity (FIG. 14).  Such portions of porous surface coatings or treatments can\nincrease bone ingrowth in and around the segments 1954 of the post portion 1948.  For example, at least a portion of the outer, bone-engaging surfaces of segments 1954 can comprise a porous coating.  In some embodiments, at least a portion of the inner\nsurface of the segment 1954 (e.g., facing the central opening 1958) can comprise a porous coating.  In some embodiments, each segment 1954 can comprise one or more recesses 1955.  Such recesses 1955 can be configured to encourage bone growth in and\naround the post portion 1948 of the implant component 1900.\n The segments 1954 can be arranged around the circumference of the post portion 1948, and can be configured to expand radially outward to increase the diameter of a central opening 1958 of the joint implant component 1900 (e.g., by increasing the\nspace between adjacent segments 1954).\n For example, an expansion tool 2160 shown in FIG. 21 can be used to expand the segments 1954 of the joint implant component 1900 from a first configuration to an expanded configuration, wherein the diameter of the central opening 1958 of the\npost portion 1948 is increased in the expanded configuration with respect to the diameter of the central opening 1958 in the first configuration.\n One embodiment of an expansion tool 2160 can comprise a tapered portion 2162, a threaded portion 2164, and an internal opening 2166 configured to engage with, for example, a screwdriver head 2168.  The expansion tool 2160 can be inserted into\nthe implant component 1900 such that the threaded portion 2164 of the expansion tool 2160 engages with the internal threads 1950 of the implant component 1900.  FIG. 22 shows the expansion tool 2160 positioned at least partially inside the central\nopening 1958 of the implant component 1900.  As shown in FIG. 22, at least a portion of the tapered portion 2162 of the expansion tool 2160 can be positioned inside the central opening 1958 of the post portion 1948 of the implant component 1900 (e.g.,\ninside the segments 1954).\n In order to expand the post portion 1948 of the implant component (e.g., in order to move the segments 1954 radially outward and increase the gap between the segments), a screwdriver head 2168 or other tool can be inserted through the central\nopening 1958 at the end 1970 adjacent the taper portion 1946 of the implant component 1900.  The screwdriver head 2168 can engage with the expansion tool 2160 via the internal opening 2166.  Turning the screwdriver head 2168 can cause the expansion tool\n2160 to be drawn through the central opening 1958 of the implant component 1900, in a longitudinal direction towards the end 1970 adjacent the taper portion 1946, due to engagement of the threaded portion 2164 of the expansion tool 2160 with the internal\nthreads 1950 of the implant component 1900.  As the expansion tool 2160 is pulled through the segments 1954, the segments 1954 are forced radially outward by the tapered portion 2162 of the expansion tool 2160.\n FIGS. 23-24 further illustrate expansion of an implant component 1900 in place within a patient\'s bone 2330 (e.g., femur 2330).  A hole 2328 can be drilled into a patient\'s bone 2330 and sized such that the post portion 1948 of the implant\ncomponent 1900 can be inserted into the hole 2328 by hand in some embodiments.  When inserted, at least a portion of the post portion 1948 of the implant component 1900 can be positioned within a hole 2328 drilled into a patient\'s bone 2330.  In some\nembodiments, the annular portion 1952 can rest against a surface 2372 of bone 2330.  Annular portion 1952 can be enlarged so as to prevent insertion of the taper portion 1946 in the hole 2328 (e.g., the annular portion 1952 can serve as a stopper,\npreventing the implant 1900 from being inserted too far into a patient\'s bone 2330).\n The expansion tool 2160 can be positioned within the central opening 1958 of the implant component 1900 before the post portion 1948 is inserted into the hole 2328 in the patient\'s bone 2330.  In this manner, once the post portion 1948 is\ninserted into the bone 2330, a screwdriver head 2168 can be inserted through the end 1970 adjacent the taper portion 1946 (e.g., the portion of the implant component 1900 that is arranged outside of the bone 2330).  The screwdriver head 2168 can engage\nwith the internal opening 2166 of the expansion tool, and as the screwdriver head 2168 is turned (FIG. 24), the expansion tool 2160 can be drawn through the central opening 1958 of the implant component 1900, towards the end 1970 of the taper portion\n1946.  As the expansion tool 2160 is drawn through the segments 1954 of the post portion 1948, the segments 1954 are moved radially outward, increasing the size of the longitudinal slits 1956 (e.g., the gap) between adjacent segments 1954, thereby\nincreasing the diameter of the central opening 1958 within the post portion 1948 and increasing the frictional engagement or press fit of the post portion 1948 with the patient\'s bone 2330.\n As shown in FIG. 25, the expansion tool can be drawn entirely through the implant component 1900, leaving the expanded implant component 1900 in the hole 2328 of the bone 2330.  Once the expansion tool is removed, further procedures can be\nperformed to complete the joint replacement.  For example, a second implant component 2574 can be arranged to couple with the implant component 1900.  For example, in the specific embodiment shown, a femoral head 2574 (e.g., a cobalt chrome femoral head)\ncan be screwed into the internal threads 1950 within the taper portion 1946 of the implant component 1900.  The femoral head 2574 can then engage with one or more additional implant components, such as a prosthetic acetabulum.\n Any of the disclosed embodiments of fixation posts can be configured to receive cement (e.g., polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), other non-resorbable cements, or a resorbable bone cement) to be injected into the hollow segmented posts.  For example,\nFIG. 15 shows a joint implant component 1500 having at least one hollow segmented fixation post 1502 comprising three segments 1522.  A needle 1532 can be inserted into the opening 1526 created by the segments 1522 and cement 1534 can be injected into\nthe central opening 1526 defined by the segments 1522.  As shown in FIG. 15, the fixation post 1502 can be configured to allow the cement 1534 to at least partially fill in the opening 1526 and flow out through removed segments of the post 1502 (e.g.,\nflow through the gaps 1524 between adjacent segments 1522).  The fixation post 1502 can thereby contribute to fixation of the joint implant component 1500 to a patient\'s bone 1530 by increasing the press fit engagement with the bone and into the bone\n(e.g., via expansion of the fixation post), by allowing for the extrusion of bone cement 1534 from the center of the post 1526 into the surrounding bone 1530, and/or by promoting or allowing bone ingrowth through the gaps between adjacent segments and\ninto the fixation post and/or bone ingrowth into porous surface portions on the implant component.\n Disclosed embodiments of a hollow segmented fixation post can provide initial fixation (e.g., via press fit engagement with the patient\'s bone) but also provide the option to inject cement down the center of the post, allowing the cement to flow\nout through the gaps between adjacent segments of the post, thereby providing a stable localized locking of the implant to the bone.  Additionally, disclosed fixation posts can allow for biologic fixation (e.g., bone ingrowth) into and on the joint\nimplant components.  For example, in embodiments where cement is not injected into the opening of the fixation posts, bone can grow into the central opening of the fixation posts by growing through the gaps between the segments of the post.  In other\nembodiments (for example, when cement is injected into the central opening), bone ingrowth can develop on, for example, porous surfaces on the joint component and fixation posts.  Such bone ingrowth can improve long term fixation of the implant.\n Disclosed embodiments of joint prostheses and joint implant components can comprise any suitable metal, plastic, ceramic, coatings, and/or combinations of these.  Generally, materials for bearing surfaces of implant components can be selected\nthat provide low-friction movement with minimal generation of wear debris.  Specific examples of suitable materials include cobalt chrome alloys, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), titanium nitride coatings, molybdenum, titanium, cobalt,\nand/or alloys or combinations of these materials.  Specific examples of surface combinations suitable for articulation with one another include titanium nitride coated metals and UHMWPE, ceramic and ceramic, metal and metal, and other combinations of\nthese.\n At least a portion of disclosed embodiments of joint implant components can include porous coatings or treatments, such as PCA beads (Bio-Vac, Inc of Michigan, USA), hydroxy apatite (HA), titanium plasma spray coating, and/or Resorbable Blast\nMedia Coating.  In some embodiments, these porous coatings or treatments can promote bone growth in and around the joint implant component.\n Methods of replacing at least part of a patient\'s joint with one or more joint implant components are also disclosed.  For example, one method comprises preparing the implant site to receive the one or more joint implant components and\nimplanting the joint prosthesis wherein at least a portion of the implant component is positioned at least partially within a hole drilled into a patient\'s bone.  Any of the disclosed embodiments of joint implant components can be used in such methods. \nFor example, the joint implant component can comprise a bone-engaging surface and at least one segmented post protruding from the bone-engaging surface, wherein the post comprises at least two segments, each segment being separated by a gap, and wherein\nthe segments define a central opening through the center of said segments.\n In some methods, at least one segmented post can be expanded from a first configuration to a second configuration, wherein the diameter of the central opening is increased in the second configuration with respect to the first configuration.  For\nexample, an expansion tool, such as the expansion tools shown in FIGS. 18 and 21, can be used to expand one or more segments of the implant component, thereby increasing the press fit of the fixation post within the patient\'s bone.  Thus, in some\nmethods, the at least one segmented post can be expanded by drawing a tapered expansion tool through at least part of the segmented post.\n Disclosed methods and joint implant components can provide a surgeon with flexibility as to whether to use biologic fixation or cement fixation for a particular implant component for a particular patient.  Such flexibility can be provided\nwithout requiring the surgeon to remove the implant or re-prepare the bone surface if he or she decided mid-surgery to alter the fixation approach.  For example, a patient\'s bone can be prepared assuming the implant component will be stabilized using\nbiologic fixation.  After preparation and insertion of the implant, the surgeon or other professional can evaluate whether biologic fixation is indeed suitable as the sole fixation method at the time of implantation.  If it is determined at the time of\nimplantation that biologic fixation may be insufficient as the sole means of implant fixation, cement can be injected into the central opening of the fixation post, without requiring removal of the implant component.\n On the other hand, if a joint implant component was implanted intending to rely on biologic fixation, and a follow-up evaluation a period of time after completion of the joint replacement reveals that the joint prosthesis is insufficiently\nstable, cement can be injected into the substantially cylindrical opening of one or more of the fixation posts at a date after initial implantation.  Such revision surgery may require clearing of fibrous or other growth from within one or more fixation\nposts in order to re-open the hollow post to accommodate injection of bone cement.\n In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and should not be taken as limiting\nthe scope of the invention.  Rather, the scope of the invention is defined by the following claims.  We therefore claim as our invention all that comes within the scope and spirit of these claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

 'patent_description': u'FIELD\n The present disclosure relates to devices for bone fracture fixation, and more specifically, to bone plates for stabilization and/or compression of bone fractures.\nBACKGROUND\n The repair of some bone fractures requires the use of implantable bone plate and screw systems in order to hold pieces of a fractured bone together and/or promote healing of the fracture.  FIG. 1 illustrates one example of a conventional bone\nplate 100 having a plurality of through-holes 102.  As shown in FIG. 2, screws 104 can be inserted through the holes 102 in order to be threaded into the bone 106, thereby securing the bone plate 100 to a bone 106 in need of repair.  In this manner, the\nbone plate 100 can be compressed against the bone 106 and the bone fracture can be stabilized.\n Conventional bone plate and screw systems promote healing of a fracture by compressing the fracture ends together and drawing the bone fragments into close apposition with each other.  Generally, bone plates can be provided with several holes\nand/or slots, the holes and slots either being threaded or non-threaded screw holes, depending on the type of screw being used.\n Threaded screw holes (e.g., through-holes in the bone plate with internal threads) are conventionally used with specialized screws having a threaded head portion in addition to a threaded shaft.  These screws are typically referred to as\n"locking" screws.  The threaded head portion engages with the threads of the screw hole to form a locking bone plate system (e.g., the locking screw is threaded into both the bone plate and the bone).  Locking screws must be inserted at a fixed,\npredetermined angle with respect to the bone plate, such angle being determined by the central axis of the threaded hole.  Once inserted, locking screws resist loosening and ensure stability between the screw and bone plate.\n Non-threaded screw holes are conventionally used with standard screws (e.g., screws with non-threaded heads).  These standard screws do not lock with the bone plate and are typically referred to as "non-locking" screws.  Non-locking screws can\nbe inserted at various different angles through the bone plate screw holes, depending on the requirements of the specific application.\n Disadvantages exist with both types of bone plate through-holes.  For example, non-locking screws may loosen in response to micromotion of the bone reconstruction.  Stable bone fixation is critical to avoid delayed healing, non-union of the\nfracture, and potential implant failure from screw loosening or screw breakage.  Thus, non-locking screws are susceptible to these and other disadvantages.\n On the other hand, locking screws are specialized screws, and much more costly than standard bone screws (with a non-threaded head).  Standard bone screws can be used with threaded screw holes in order to create a locking bone plate system,\nhowever, such systems often require a bone plate height of 5 mm or greater (0.198 inches or greater) in order to provide space for accommodating the bone screw head and for enough threads to engage the bone screw shaft.  Bone plates having a height of 5\nmm or greater are disadvantageous because such heights may make it difficult for a surgeon to close the wound over the bone plate.  For example, suturing the skin closed over a bone plate with a 5 mm height may impose extra tension on the skin and soft\ntissues, potentially resulting in complications such as non-healing and/or infection.\n There thus remains a need for an improved bone plate and bone screw system that can provide a locking relationship while reducing or eliminating the above-described disadvantages.\nSUMMARY\n Disclosed embodiments of a bone plate and screw system can allow for a locking relationship between the bone plate and bone screw, with the use of a standard (non-threaded head) bone screw.  Furthermore, disclosed embodiments can provide for a\nlocking bone plate having a low profile (e.g., a height of less than about 5 mm).  Some embodiments include a bone plate having non-threaded screw-holes and screws having non-threaded heads.\n One embodiment of a bone plate comprises a bone-contacting surface, a second surface opposite the bone-contacting surface, defining a plate thickness therebetween, at least one non-threaded through-hole passing between the bone-contacting\nsurface and the second surface, said through-hole being configured to receive a bone screw, and a locking element, wherein said locking element is configured to engage a thread of the bone screw, and wherein a first end of the locking element is coupled\nto the bone plate.  For example, the first end of the locking element can be secured to the bone-contacting surface of the bone plate and/or the locking element can be secured to the plate thickness.\n Some embodiments comprise a flange arranged within the through-hole.  The flange can be positioned substantially centrally along the plate thickness.  In other embodiments, the flange can be positioned adjacent the bone-contacting surface.  Some\nembodiments comprise a second flange that can be positioned, for example, adjacent the second surface of the bone plate.  Additionally or alternatively, some embodiments can comprise a counter-bore recess adjacent the bone-contacting surface of the bone\nplate.  In some embodiments, the counter-bore recess can substantially prevent migration of the locking element towards the second surface of the bone plate.\n In some embodiments, the through-hole can comprise a tapered portion to accommodate a head of the bone screw.  For example, the tapered portion can be configured to allow substantially the entire head of the bone screw to be positioned between\nthe bone-contacting surface and the second surface.  In some embodiments, the through-hole can comprise a chamfered and/or counter-sunk portion.  In this manner, the hole opening adjacent the second surface of the bone plate can be configured to engage\nwith the head of the bone screw.\n The flange and/or the locking element can be arranged to provide a concentric opening within the screw-hole.  In some embodiments, the diameter of the concentric opening can be larger than a minor diameter of the bone screw and smaller than a\nmajor diameter of the bone screw (e.g., the diameter of the concentric opening can be greater than the root diameter of the bone screw shaft and less than the outer diameter of the bone screw threads).  In some embodiments, the concentric opening can be\nsubstantially circular.  The flange can have a flange thickness less than a pitch of a thread of the bone screw in some embodiments.  In some embodiments, the cross-sectional diameter of the locking element can be less than a pitch of a thread of the\nbone screw.\n The locking element can take many possible forms in different embodiments.  For example, the locking element can comprise a straight wire.  In some embodiments, the straight wire can comprise a first end, a second end, and a central portion\nbetween the first and second ends, wherein the first and second ends are welded to the bone plate (e.g., to the bone-contacting surface and/or to the counter-bore recess) or within the plate thickness and the central portion extends transversely across\nthe through-hole.  In some embodiments, the central portion can be curved.\n Embodiments of the locking element can comprise, for example, a coil spring, a straight wire, two straight wires arranged substantially parallel to one another, a substantially triangular wire, a substantially square wire, and/or a substantially\ncircular wire.\n In some embodiments, the through-hole can be tapered to allow for angulation of the bone screw.\n According to one embodiment, a bone plate can comprise a bone-contacting surface, a second surface opposite the bone-contacting surface, defining a plate thickness therebetween, at least one non-threaded through-hole passing between the\nbone-contacting surface and the second surface, a flange formed integrally with the through-hole, and a head-engaging portion configured to engage a head of a bone screw inserted into the through-hole, wherein the head engaging portion and the flange are\nconfigured to form a locking relationship between the bone plate and the bone screw.\n In some embodiments, the head-engaging portion can comprise a chamfered, tapered, or countersunk portion adjacent the second surface.  In some embodiments, the head-engaging portion can comprise a thin wall formed between the through-hole and\none or more adjacent bores, between the through-hole and an annular channel surrounding the through-hole, and/or between the through-hole and one or more longitudinal slits formed in the plate thickness, extending from the second surface towards the\nbone-contacting surface.\n According to some embodiments, the flange can be positioned adjacent the bone-contacting surface.  The head-engaging portion can comprise a second flange positioned adjacent the second surface of the bone plate.\n In some aspects, the through-hole can be configured to allow insertion of the bone screw from either the bone-contacting surface or the second surface.\n Some embodiments can comprise a locking element positioned at least partially within an opening formed by the flange, the locking element being configured to engage threads of the bone screw.\n The bone plate can be a low profile bone plate, having a thickness of less than about 5 mm.\n The present disclosure also concerns methods for providing a locking relationship between a bone plate and a bone screw inserted into a non-threaded through-hole provided in the bone plate.  One embodiment of a method can comprise forming a\nconcentric opening within the through-hole, the concentric opening having a diameter that is greater than a minor diameter of the bone screw and less than a major diameter of the bone screw, inserting a bone screw into the through-hole and concentric\nopening, tightening the bone screw so as to engage threads of the bone screw with the concentric opening, engaging a head of the bone screw with a head-engaging portion of the bone plate, and tightening the bone screw further such that the bone screw\nhead compresses the head-engaging portion and the threads compress against the concentric opening, thereby forming a locking relationship between the bone screw and the bone plate.\n In some embodiments, forming a concentric opening comprises providing a flange formed integrally with the through-hole.  Forming a concentric opening can comprise providing a locking element positioned within the through-hole.\n According to some embodiments, providing a locking element can comprise positioning one or more of a straight wire, a curved wire, a looped wire, and a coil spring within the through-hole.\n In some methods, the concentric opening can be positioned adjacent a bone-contacting surface of the bone plate, and the head-engaging portion can be positioned adjacent a second surface of the bone plate opposite the bone-contacting surface.\n Some methods can include providing a counter-bore recess adjacent a bone-contacting surface of the bone plate.  Further, a locking element having a first end can be provided, and the first end of the locking element can be welded to the\ncounter-bore recess, thereby substantially preventing movement of the locking element during tightening of the bone screw.\n The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.

Additionally, the term "includes" means "comprises." Further, the term "coupled"\ngenerally means electrically, electromagnetically, and/or physically (e.g., mechanically or chemically) coupled or linked and does not exclude the presence of intermediate elements between the coupled items.\n Terms such as "above," "upper," "below," and "lower" are meant only to show the position of some features relative to others as shown in the drawings, and do not necessarily correlate to actual positions or directions of those features when the\nreplacement valve is being delivered and/or is in its implanted configuration or position.\n Descriptions and disclosures provided in association with one particular embodiment are not limited to that embodiment, and may be applied to any embodiment disclosed.\n Moreover, for the sake of simplicity, the figures may not show the various ways (readily discernable, based on this disclosure, by one of ordinary skill in the art) in which the disclosed system, method, and apparatus can be used in combination\nwith other systems, methods, and apparatuses.\n While FIGS. 3-9 show only partial views of bone plates and only one through-hole is visible, a bone plate can include a plurality of through-holes arranged in any suitable fashion.  In embodiments with more than one through-hole, each\nthrough-hole can be designed substantially the same.  In some embodiments, one or more of the through-holes in a given bone plate can have a different design than one or more other through-holes in the bone plate.  Such configurations can be optimized\nfor particular applications.  As will be described in further detail, embodiments of through-holes can include a hole opening near an upper bone plate surface that has a geometry that engages a standard bone screw head through interference.  A flange\nand/or locking element adjacent a lower surface (e.g., a bone contacting surface) of the bone plate can be provided to work with the hole opening geometry to effectively lock a bone screw in place, once tightened.\n FIG. 3 illustrates a section view of one embodiment of a low profile locking bone plate according to the present disclosure.  A screw 300 can be used to secure a bone plate 302 (e.g., a low profile bone plate) to a portion of a bone 304.  The\nscrew 300 can be a standard bone screw 300, without a threaded head, and having a constant root diameter.  Through-hole 306 can pass through the entire plate thickness of the bone plate 302, from a bone contacting surface 310 to a second surface 308. \nThrough-hole 306 can be provided with, for example, a tapered or angled side wall 312, against which the head 314 of the bone screw 300 can be compressed.  Thus, the side wall 312 can be a head-engaging portion in some embodiments.\n Through-hole 306 can also include a flange 316 (e.g., an annular flange) that can engage with the threads 318 of the bone screw 300.  Flange 316 can be formed integrally with the through-hole 306.  Flange 316 can create an opening concentric\nwith the through-hole 306, where the concentric opening has a diameter that is less than the major diameter of the bone screw 300 and greater than the minor diameter of the bone screw 300.  Additionally, the height h of flange 316 can be less than the\npitch of the threads 318.  In this manner, the bone screw 300 can be screwed into the bone 304, by being screwed through the flange 316.  As the screw 300 is tightened and the head 314 engages with the side wall 312, a first portion 348 of the thread 318\ncan engage with an upper surface 350 of the flange 316.  Furthermore, as the screw 300 is tightened, a second portion 352 of the thread 318 can engage with a lower surface 354 of the flange 316.\n In some embodiments, the through-hole 306 can include a locking element 320.  Locking element 320 can be, for example, a straight wire or a spring coil, as will be described in further detail below, in association with FIGS. 11-27.  The locking\nelement 320 can create an opening (e.g., an opening concentric with the through-hole 306) having a diameter that is less than the major diameter of the bone screw 300 and greater than the minor diameter of the bone screw 300.  As the bone screw 300 is\ntightened into the bone 304, the locking element 320 can flex, thereby improving the lock between the bone screw 300 and the bone plate 302.  As the bone screw head 314 engages with the hole opening adjacent the second surface 308 of the bone plate 302\n(e.g., the tapered side walls 312 of the through-hole 306), the locking element 320 can be compressed between the threads 318 and the flange 316.  In some embodiments, as the screw 300 is tightened and the screw head 314 is compressed against the side\nwall 312 near the hole opening at the first surface 308 of the bone plate 302, the locking element 320 can be tensioned between the threads 318 and the bone plate 302.\n The locking element 320 can be positioned adjacent the bone-contacting surface 310 of bone plate 302, with at least one end secured to the bone plate 302 to substantially prevent the locking element 320 from rotating or moving relative to the\nscrew 300 as the screw 300 is inserted and tightened.  For example, at least one end of the locking element 320 can be laser welded to the bone plate 302 (e.g., laser welded to the bone-contacting surface 310, to the flange 306, and/or to the plate\nthickness).\n While FIG. 3 illustrates a locking element 320, locking element 320 is optional.  Furthermore, while the through-holes illustrated in FIGS. 4-9 are not shown with locking elements, each of these embodiments can include one or more locking\nelements (any of the locking elements described above or below), such locking elements being further described below.\n FIGS. 4-9 illustrate various other embodiments of a through-hole having a flange that can be included in a bone plate.\n FIG. 4 shows another embodiment of a bone screw 400 securing a bone plate 402 to a bone 404 and having a bone screw head 414.  Bone screw 400 can be a standard bone screw, without a threaded head.  Bone plate 402 can include a through-hole 406\nthat passes from a first surface 408 to an opposite, bone-contacting surface 410.  Through-hole 406 can include substantially straight side walls 412 and a flange 416.  Flange 416 can be formed integrally with the through-hole 406.  The flange 416 can\nhave a height h that is less than the pitch of threads 418 of bone screw 400.  Furthermore, the flange 416 can create a concentric opening within the through-hole 306, the opening having a diameter that is less than the major diameter of the bone screw\n400, and greater than the minor diameter of the bone screw 400.\n FIG. 5 shows another embodiment of a bone screw 500 securing a bone plate 502 to a bone 504.  Bone screw 500 can be a standard bone screw, without a threaded head.  Bone plate 502 can include a through-hole 506 that passes from a first surface\n508 to an opposite, bone-contacting surface 510.  Through-hole 506 can include substantially straight side walls 512 and a chamfered portion 522 adjacent the first surface 508.  The chamfered portion 522 can be sized relative to the bone screw head 514\nsuch that a portion of the bone screw head 514 is positioned outside of the through-hole 506 (e.g., above the first surface 508 of the bone plate 502) when the bone screw 500 is locked with the bone plate 502 (e.g., when the bone screw 500 is fully\ninserted into the bone 504).  Thus, the chamfered portion 522 can be a head-engaging portion.  Through-hole 506 can also include a flange 516 that can be formed integrally with the through-hole 506.  The flange 516 can have a height h that is less than\nthe pitch of threads 518 of bone screw 500.  Furthermore, the flange 516 can create an opening having a diameter that is less than the major diameter of the bone screw 500, and greater than the minor diameter of the bone screw 500.\n FIG. 6 shows another embodiment of a bone screw 600 securing a bone plate 602 to a bone 604.  Bone screw 600 can be a standard bone screw, without a threaded head.  Bone plate 602 can include a through-hole 606 that passes from a first surface\n608 to an opposite, bone-contacting surface 610.  Through-hole 606 can include substantially straight side walls 612 and a curved, countersunk portion 624 adjacent the first surface 608.  The countersunk portion 624 can be, for example, a spherical\ncountersink.  The countersunk portion 624 can be sized relative to the bone screw head 614 such that substantially all of the bone screw head 614 is positioned within the through-hole 606 (e.g., below the first surface 608 of the bone plate 602) when the\nbone screw 600 is locked with the bone plate 602 (e.g., when the bone screw 600 is fully inserted into the bone 604).  Thus, the countersunk portion 624 can be a head-engaging portion.  Through-hole 606 can also include a flange 616 that can be formed\nintegrally with the through-hole 606.  The flange 616 can have a height h that is less than the pitch of threads 618 of bone screw 600.  Furthermore, the flange 616 can create an opening having a diameter that is less than the major diameter of the bone\nscrew 600, and greater than the minor diameter of the bone screw 600.\n FIG. 7 shows an embodiment of a bone plate 702 having a through-hole 706.  As shown in FIG. 7, a bone screw 700 can secure a bone plate 702 to a bone 704.  Bone screw 700 can be a standard bone screw, without a threaded head.  Bone plate 702 can\ninclude a through-hole 706 that passes from a first surface 708 to an opposite, bone-contacting surface 710.  Through-hole 706 can include substantially straight side walls 712, a chamfer 734, and a flange 716 that can be formed integrally with the\nthrough-hole 706.  The flange 716 can have a height h that is less than the pitch of threads 718 of bone screw 700.  Furthermore, the flange 716 can create an opening having a diameter that is less than the major diameter of the bone screw 700, and\ngreater than the minor diameter of the bone screw 700.\n As also seen in FIG. 29, bone plate 702 can also include an annular channel 729 surrounding the through-hole 706.  In one embodiment, the annular channel 729 can extend from the first surface 708 towards the bone-contacting surface 710, but does\nnot pass all the way through the thickness of the bone plate 702.  The annular channel 729 can create thin walls 728 in the bone plate 702 that deflect or flex under pressure from the bone screw head 714 as the bone screw 700 is tightened into the bone\n704.  In this manner, the deformation of the thin walls 728 can lock the bone screw 700 against the bone plate 702.  The thin walls 728 can thus be head-engaging portions of the bone plate 702.  In some embodiments, one or more slots or bores 726 can be\npositioned adjacent one or more through-holes 706.  For example, one or more bores can be formed in the thin wall 728 such that the thin wall 728 is configured as a sectioned annular ring surrounding the through-hole 706, as seen in FIG. 29.  In the\nembodiment of FIG. 29, four bores 726 are spaced at substantially 90 degree intervals around the through-hole 706.  In other embodiments, more or fewer bores 726 can be provided, spaced at different intervals.  In some embodiments, the thin wall 728 can\nbe a solid annular ring, without any bores 726.\n An annular channel 729 can be positioned adjacent each through-hole 706 in the bone plate 702.  Alternatively, some through-holes 706 can be positioned without an annular channel 729 in immediate proximity, while other through-holes 706 can be\npositioned near an annular channel 729.\n FIG. 8 shows an embodiment of a bone plate 802 having a through-hole 806 with a first flange 816 adjacent the bone-contacting surface 810 and a second flange or lip 830 adjacent the first surface 808.  The first flange 816 and/or the second\nflange 830 can be formed integrally with the through-hole 806.  As shown in FIG. 8, a bone screw 800 can secure a bone plate 802 to a bone 804.  Bone screw 800 can be a standard bone screw, without a threaded head.  Bone plate 802 can include a\nthrough-hole 806 that passes from a bone plate first surface 808 to an opposite, bone-contacting surface 810.  Through-hole 806 can include substantially straight side walls 812 between the first flange 816 and the second flange 830.  The flanges 816,\n830 can have a height h, h\' respectively, each of which can be less than the pitch of threads 818 of bone screw 800.  Furthermore, the flanges 816, 830 can create openings concentric with the through-hole, each opening having a diameter that is less than\nthe major diameter of the bone screw 800, and greater than the minor diameter of the bone screw 800.  In this manner, the bone screw 800 can be screwed through each of the flanges 816, 830.\n The second flange 830 can be sized such that the bone screw head 814 cannot enter the through-hole 806 because the diameter of the opening created by flange 830 can be less than the diameter of the bone screw head 814.  Thus, substantially all\nof the bone screw head 814 can be positioned adjacent the first bone plate surface 808, outside of the through-hole 806.  The second flange 830 can be sized such that its thickness allows inward deformation (e.g., deflection of second flange 830 towards\nthe interior of the through-hole 806) of the second flange 830 as the screw 800 is tightened.  This deformation of the second flange 830 can further secure the lock between the bone screw 800 and the bone plate 802 as the bone screw is tightened.  The\nsecond flange 830 can thus be a head-engaging portion of the bone plate 802.\n FIG. 9 shows a bone plate 902 having a through-hole 906 that can allow for insertion of a bone screw from either side of the bone plate 902.  For example, a bone screw can be inserted from the first surface 908 or from the second surface 910. \nThrough-hole 906 can include a first tapered, or angled side wall 912 and a second angled side wall 932, each being configured to receive a bone screw head (thus each being configurable as a head-engaging portion).  Side wall 912 and/or side wall 932 can\ninclude chamfered portions adjacent the first surface 908 or second surface 910, respectively, such chamfered portions being configured to receive and engage a portion of a bone screw head.  Through-hole 906 can also include a flange 916 that can be\nformed integrally with the through-hole 906.  In some embodiments, flange 916 can be substantially centrally located along the thickness of the bone plate 902 (e.g., the flange 916 can be substantially equidistant from the first surface 908 and the\nsecond surface 910).  In other embodiments, the flange 916 can be closer to the first surface 908 or closer to the second surface 910.  The flange 916 can create an opening concentric to the through-hole 906, the opening having a diameter greater than a\nminor diameter of a bone screw to be inserted, and less than a major diameter of the bone screw.  Furthermore, as with other embodiments discussed above, the thickness, or height, of the flange 916 can be less than the pitch of the bone screw threads. \nThe flange 916 can thus engage the threads of the bone screw as the bone screw head engages with the side walls 912 or 932, thereby locking the bone screw in place in the bone plate 902.\n FIGS. 11-27 illustrate various embodiments of locking elements that can be used in a through-hole in a bone plate, with or without a flange, in order to create a locking relationship between the bone plate and the bone screw that can\nsubstantially prevent the bone screw from loosening over time in some embodiments.\n FIGS. 11-12 illustrate one embodiment of a locking element 1120 that can be coupled to a bone plate 1102, and positioned such that at least a portion of the locking element 1120 passes transversely through a through-hole 1106 (FIG. 12).  For\nexample, the through-hole 1106 can define a longitudinal axis Z (FIG. 11) through the center of the through-hole 1106, passing from the first surface 1108 of the bone plate 1102 to the second surface 1110.  In such an embodiment, the locking element 1120\ncan be positioned substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis Z. Locking element 1120 can be arranged adjacent the side wall 1112 of the through-hole 1106 such that it is positioned between the side wall 1112 and a bone screw 1100 when the\nbone screw 1100 is screwed into the bone (bone screw 1100 is not shown in FIG. 12, for clarity).\n A first end 1136 and/or a second end 1138 of the locking element 1120 can be secured to the bone plate 1102.  For example, in one embodiment, the first end 1136 of the locking element can be welded (e.g., laser welded) to the bone plate 1102\n(e.g., welded to the bone-contacting surface 1110 or welded within the bone plate thickness).  Thus, the locking element 1120 can remain substantially stationary while a bone screw 1100 is screwed into bone via the through-hole 1106.  The cross-sectional\ndiameter of the locking element 1120 can be less than the pitch of the bone screw threads 1118 so that the locking element 1120 can pass between the threads 1118 as the screw 1100 is inserted.  The through-hole 1106 can also include a chamfered or\ncountersunk portion 1134 that can accommodate at least a portion of the bone screw head 1114.\n The locking element 1120 can be positioned adjacent the bone-contacting surface 1110.  In some embodiments, bone plate 1102 can include a counter bore recess 1156 that can substantially prevent the locking element 1120 from advancing towards the\nhead 1114 of screw 1100 as the screw 1100 is tightened.  After the screw head 1114 is compressed against the hole opening adjacent the first surface 1108 of the bone plate 1102, as the screw 1100 is further tightened, the locking element 1120 is\ntensioned and compressed against the recess 1156, thereby locking the screw 1100 in place.  In some embodiments, at least one of the ends 1136, 1138 can be secured, such as by laser welding, to a portion of the counter bore recess 1156.\n As shown in FIGS. 11-12, the locking element 1120 can be a substantially straight wire.  In other embodiments, such as the specific examples shown in FIGS. 13-27, a locking element can be configured in different shapes.  For example, a locking\nelement 1320 can be configured as a spring coil 1320, as shown in FIGS. 13-17.  Locking element 1320 can include first and second free ends 1336, 1338 being arranged at least slightly offset from one another, as best seen in FIG. 15.\n Bone plate 1302 can have a bone-contacting surface and a second surface 1308.  The locking element 1320 can be positioned within a through-hole 1306.  In some embodiments, locking element 1320 can be positioned adjacent a bone-contacting surface\n1310.  Bone plate 1302 can include a counter bore recess 1356 that can substantially prevent the locking element 1320 from advancing towards the head 1314 of a screw 1300 as the screw is tightened.  Bone plate 1302 can also include a countersink 1334\n(with a side wall 1312) to engage the head 1314 of the screw 1300.  Locking element 1320 can create an opening concentric to the through-hole 1306, the concentric opening having a diameter d (FIG. 14), through which the screw 1300 can be advanced.  The\ndiameter d can be greater than the minor diameter of the screw 1300 and less than the major diameter of the screw 1300.  Furthermore, the cross-sectional diameter t of the locking element 1320 can be less than the pitch of the threads 1318, so as not to\ninterfere with tightening of the screw 1300.  As shown in FIG. 16, the locking element 1320 can be positioned within a through-hole 1306 so as to engage with the threads 1318 of a screw 1300, inserted as shown in FIG. 17.\n Further embodiments of locking element configurations are illustrated in FIGS. 19-23, which show top views of a bone plate through-hole having one or more locking elements positioned transversely across the through-hole.  In each of the\ndescribed embodiments, the one or more locking elements can be secured, for example, to the lower surface of the bone plate (e.g., laser welded to the bone-contacting surface of the bone plate).  Each locking element can be provided within a counter bore\nrecess adjacent the bone-contacting surface of the bone plate, as best seen in FIG. 11.\n The bone plate 1902 of FIG. 19 can include a through-hole 1906 with chamfered portion 1934 (shown as chamfered portion 2034 in FIG. 20, chamfered portion 2134 in FIG. 21, and chamfered portion 2234 in FIG. 22).  Two locking elements 1920 can be\npositioned to pass across opposing sides of the through-hole 1906.  Locking elements 1906 can be substantially straight wires with centrally located bowed or curved portions 1921 exposed in the through-hole 1906.  One or both of the ends 1936, 1938 of\nthe locking elements 1920 can be secured (e.g., welded) to the bone plate 1902.  FIG. 20 illustrates a similar locking element 2020 to that shown in FIG. 19, but with a single curved locking element 2020 with a bowed or curved portion 2021 instead of two\npassing across the through-hole 2006.  As with the embodiment shown in FIG. 19, one or both of the ends 2026, 2038 of the locking element 2020 can be fixed with respect to the bone plate 2002.\n The locking element 2120 shown in FIG. 21 can be provided with just a first end 2136 secured within the bone plate 2120.  The second end 2138 of the locking element 2120 can be a free end 2138 positioned within the through-hole 2106.  The\nportion 2121 of the locking element 2120 arranged within the through-hole 2106 can be configured to form a substantially circular, concentric coil shape as seen in FIG. 21.  In this configuration, there can be more surface contact between the locking\nelement 2120 and a bone screw inserted into the through-hole 2106.  The curved portion 2121 of the locking element can be configured substantially concentrically within the through-hole 2106, so as not to interfere with insertion of the bone screw.  The\nlocking element 2120 can thus create an opening concentric with the through-hole 2106, the opening having a diameter greater than the minor diameter of a bone screw inserted into the through-hole 2120 and less than the major diameter of the bone screw. \nIn some embodiments, the through-hole 2106 can be provided with a counter bore recess that would substantially obscure vision of the locking element 2120 in the view seen in FIG. 21.\n FIG. 22 shows another embodiment of a locking element 2220 that can be provided in a through-hole 2206 of a bone plate 2202.  Locking element 2220 can include a first end 2236 and a second end 2238.  First end 2236 and second end 2238 can each\nbe positioned within the thickness of bone plate 2202, and either or both of the first and second ends 2236, 2238 can be secured (e.g., welded) to or within the bone plate 2202.  Locking element 2220 can include a central portion 2240 arranged in a\ncoiled configuration in the through-hole 2206.  As shown in FIG. 22, the central portion 2240 can be arranged such that the central axis of the coiled central portion 2240 is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of through-hole 2206.  Central portion\n2240 can include four direction changes to create the coil, as seen in FIG. 22.  Alternatively, the coil can include more or fewer direction changes.\n FIG. 23 shows another embodiment of a locking element 2320 that can be provided in a through-hole 2306 of a bone plate 2302.  Locking element 2320 can include a first end 2336 and a second end 2338.  First end 2336 and second end 2338 can each\nbe positioned within the thickness of bone plate 2302, and either or both of the first and second ends 2336, 2338 can be secured (e.g., welded) to or within the bone plate 2302.  In other embodiments, first and/or second ends 2336, 2338 can be coupled to\nthe bone-contacting surface of bone plate 2302.  Locking element 2320 can include a central portion 2340 arranged in a looped configuration in the through-hole 2306.  As shown in the example seen in FIG. 23, the looped central portion 2340 can be\narranged such that a first segment 2342 crosses over a second segment 2344, which continues to the second end 2338.  The looped portion 2340 can create an opening within the through-hole 2306, the opening having a diameter greater than the minor diameter\nof a bone screw inserted in the through-hole 2306, and less than the major diameter of the bone screw.  As the bone screw is tightened, the bone screw head can engage with chamfered or countersunk portion 2334, while the bone screw threads engage with\nthe locking element 2320 to lock the bone screw in place with respect to the bone plate 2302.\n In addition to the above-described embodiments of various locking elements, other configurations are also suitable.  For example, FIGS. 24-27 illustrate additional embodiments of possible locking elements 2420, 2520, 2620, and 2720,\nrespectively.  Each of the embodiments shown in FIGS. 24-27 can be incorporated into or across a through-hole of a bone plate, as described above.  FIG. 24 shows a locking element 2420 that can be arranged in a substantially triangular configuration. \nFIG. 25 shows a locking element 2520 that can be arranged in a substantially square or diamond configuration.  FIG. 26 shows a locking element 2620 that can be arranged in a polygonal configuration, such as the substantially cross-shaped configuration\nshown.  FIG. 27 shows a locking element 2720 that can be arranged in a substantially elliptical or oval configuration.  Each of the embodiments can have two free ends 2436, 2438, 2536, 2538, 2636, 2638, 2736, 2738, respectively.  In alternative\nembodiments, one or more of the free ends can be secured (e.g., laser welded) to a bone plate.\n Disclosed embodiments can allow for angulated insertion of a bone screw into a bone plate, as shown in FIGS. 10 and 18.  FIG. 10 shows a bone plate 1002 having a through-hole 1006 that can allow for angulated insertion of bone screw 1000.  As\nshown in FIG. 10, side walls 1012 of the through-hole 1006 can be curved and enlarged with respect to the bone screw head 1014, in order to facilitate adjustment of the bone screw 1000 so that it can be inserted into a bone segment at any angle within a\nrange of angles.  Side walls 1012 can engage the head 1014 of the bone screw 1000 no matter the angle of insertion.\n Through-hole 1006 can include a locking element 1020 that can provide a locking relationship between the bone plate 1002 and the bone screw 1000 without requiring a threaded bone screw head 1014 or other specialized bone screw features (e.g.,\nthe bone screw 1000 can have a constant diameter shaft).  For example, the locking element 1020 can engage with the threads 1018 of the bone screw 1000.  As shown in FIG. 10, when a bone screw 1000 is inserted at an angle relative to the longitudinal\naxis of the through-hole 1006, a first portion 1046 of the locking element 1020 may engage with the threads 1018, while a second portion 1048 of the locking element 1020 may be spaced apart from the threads 1018, due to the angulation of the bone screw\n1000.  Additionally or alternatively, through-hole 1006 can be provided with a flange positioned adjacent the first surface 1008, the second surface 1010, and/or between the first and second surfaces 1008, 1010, such as substantially centrally located\nbetween the two surfaces.\n FIG. 18 shows another embodiment of a bone plate 1802 having a through-hole 1806 that can accommodate a bone screw 1800 inserted at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis Z of the through-hole 1806.  Through-hole 1806 can include a\ncountersunk portion 1834 adjacent a first surface 1808 to accommodate at least a portion of the screw head 1814.  Through-hole 1806 can also be provided with a locking element 1820, such as coil spring 1820, which can engage the threads 1818 of the bone\nscrew 1800.  The locking element 1820 can have a cross-sectional diameter that is less than the pitch of the threads 1818, such that the bone screw 1800 can be threaded through the through-hole 1806 and locking element 1820 until the screw head 1814\nengages with the countersunk portion 1834.  Through-hole 1806 can also be provided with a widened portion 1840 adjacent a second bone plate surface 1810 that can facilitate angled insertion of the bone screw 1800.  To further facilitate angled insertion\nof a screw 1800, the through-hole 1806 can include tapered side wall 1812.\n While the locking elements illustrated and described above generally have a circular cross-section, other cross-section configurations are also suitable for use with any of the embodiments described above or below.  For example, locking elements\ncan be provided with elliptical, square, triangular, or any other cross-sectional geometries.  One embodiment of a locking element 3020 having a non-circular cross section is shown in FIG. 32.  In some embodiments, the locking element 3020 can be a\nflattened ring, having a substantially rectangular cross section.  The locking element can have a first free end 3236 and a second free end 3238.  In alternative embodiments, the locking element can have a different cross-sectional geometry, can be a\nsolid ring, and/or can have two free ends offset from one another along the Z axis (the longitudinal axis of the through-hole 3006).  In some embodiments, one or both of the free ends 3236, 3238 can be secured to a bone plate 3002 (FIGS. 30-31).  For\nexample, one or both of the free ends 3236, 3238 can be welded (e.g., laser welded) to the bone plate 3002, such as to a counter-bore recess 3056.\n In some embodiments, a low profile bone plate can include one or more through-holes adapted for insertion of a screw parallel to the longitudinal axis of the through-hole, or insertion at an angle to the longitudinal axis of the through-hole. \nFor example, FIGS. 30-31 illustrate such a through-hole 3006, which can include a locking element 3020.  Bone plate 3002 can include one or more through-holes 3006, which form an opening between a first surface 3008 and a bone-contacting surface 3010. \nThe through-hole 3006 can include tapered (e.g., angled) side walls 3012 and can be configured to receive a bone screw 3000.  The side walls 3012 can be configured to engage with the head 3014 of the bone screw 3000 as the bone screw 3000 is tightened\ninto a portion of a patient\'s bone.  Through-hole 3006 can also include a counter-bore recess 3056 that can be positioned, for example, adjacent the bone-contacting surface 3010.  The counter-bore recess 3056 can, in some embodiments, contain a locking\nelement 3020.  Locking element 3020 can be substantially ring shaped, thereby forming an opening (e.g., the inner diameter of the locking element) concentric with the through-hole 3006.  The concentric opening can have a diameter that is greater than the\nminor diameter of the bone screw 3000 and less than the major diameter of the bone screw 3000.  Thus, when a bone screw 3000 is inserted into the through-hole 3006 and through the locking element 3020, the locking element 3020 does not prevent the bone\nscrew 3000 from being screwed into the bone, but instead engages with the threads 3018 of the bone screw 3000.\n In some embodiments, a portion of the locking element 3020 can engage with the counter-bore recess 3056 as the bone screw 3000 is tightened, with the counter-bore recess 3056 preventing the locking element 3020 from migrating towards the first\nsurface 3008 of the bone plate as the bone screw 3000 is tightened.  In some embodiments, at least a portion of the locking element 3020 can be secured to the counter-bore recess 3056.  For example, at least one end of the locking element 3020 can be\nwelded to the counter-bore recess 3056.\n As shown in FIG. 31, the through-hole 3006 can be enlarged with respect to a normal through-hole size for a given bone screw, in order to allow for insertion of a bone screw 3000 at an angle .theta.  with respect to the longitudinal axis Z of\nthe through-hole 3006.  Inserting the bone screw 3000 at an angle .theta.  can cause, or be facilitated by, shifting of the locking element 3020 within the counter-bore recess 3056, to create a gap 3058 between one edge of the locking element 3020 and\nthe bone plate 3002.  The locking element 3020 can be designed such that even when it is positioned in this shifted arrangement, its width is such that at least a portion of the locking element 3020 adjacent the gap 3058 is still positioned within the\ncounter-bore recess 3056, thereby preventing migration of the locking element 3020 towards the first surface 3008, even if the bone screw 3000 is inserted at an angle .theta..\n Bone plates according to the present disclosure can include a plurality of bone screws and screw holes, and can include one or more of any of the illustrated screw-holes with or without flanges, with or without one or more locking elements.  In\nthis manner, a low profile bone plate can function as a locking bone plate without the need for specialized bone screws with threaded heads, and without the need for threaded through-holes.  However, if desired, any of the described embodiments of\nthrough-holes can be threaded, or have threaded portions in addition to the other features described.  Any of the described embodiments are amenable to a low-profile bone plate design, as the described bone plates can provide a locking relationship\nbetween the bone plate and one or more bone screws without the need for threaded holes or specialized bone screws.  Accordingly, any of the described embodiments can be provided in a bone plate having a low-profile, such as a bone plate having a\nthickness of less than about 5 mm.  In some embodiments, a low-profile bone plate according to the present disclosure can have a thickness of from about 0.1 mm to about 5 mm.  Specific embodiments of a low-profile bone plate can have a thickness of from\nabout 1 mm to about 5 mm.\n Disclosed embodiments of a low profile bone plate can comprise any suitable material.  For example, a low profile bone plate can include materials such as stainless steel, titanium, cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, aluminum,\nvanadium, PMMA, PEEK, ceramics, silicone, PLA, PGA, UHMWPE, polymers, or alloys or combinations thereof.  Disclosed low profile bone plates can also be provided with one or more layers of a ceramic, polymer, and/or one or more layers of various other\ncoatings.  For example, some embodiments of low profile bone plates can include a porous outer coating.  Embodiments of a locking element can also comprise any suitable material.  For example, a locking element can include materials such as metal and/or\npolymer wires, stainless steel, titanium, cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, aluminum, vanadium, PMMA, PEEK, ceramics, silicone, PLA, PGA, UHMWPE, polymers, or alloys or combinations thereof.  One specific embodiment of a locking element can\ncomprise stainless steel spring wire.\n Any of the disclosed embodiments can be combined or used with one another in any type of bone plate.  FIG. 28 illustrates a few examples of different prior art bone plate geometries 2800, 2802, 2804 that can be provided with the through-holes\nand locking elements herein described.  The bone plates shown in FIG. 28 are shown simply as examples, and are not meant to be limiting in any way.  Disclosed embodiments of bone plates and through-holes can be incorporated into any type of bone plate,\nfor both human and veterinary applications.\n A method for providing a locking relationship between a bone plate and a bone screw inserted into a non-threaded through-hole provided in the bone plate is also disclosed.  In some embodiments, a concentric opening can be formed within the\nthrough-hole, the concentric opening having a diameter that is greater than a minor diameter of the bone screw and less than a major diameter of the bone screw.  A bone screw can be inserted into the through-hole and concentric opening, and tightened. \nAs the bone screw is tightened, the threads of the bone screw can engage with the concentric opening and a head of the bone screw can engage with a head-engaging portion of the bone plate.  As the bone screw is tightened, the bone screw head can compress\nthe head-engaging portion and the threads can compress against the concentric opening, thereby forming a locking relationship between the bone screw and the bone plate.\n The concentric opening can be formed by providing a flange formed integrally with the through-hole and/or by providing a locking element positioned within the through-hole.  The locking element can be any locking element described above, such as\na straight wire, a curved wire, a looped wire, and/or a coil spring positioned within the through-hole.\n In some embodiments, the concentric opening can be positioned adjacent a bone-contacting surface of the bone plate, and the head-engaging portion can be positioned adjacent a second surface of the bone plate opposite the bone-contacting surface. Some methods include providing counter-bore recess adjacent a bone-contacting surface of the bone plate.  In such embodiments, a first end of the locking element can be welded to the counter-bore recess, thereby substantially preventing movement of the\nlocking element during tightening of the bone screw.\n In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and should not be taken as limiting\nthe scope of the invention.  Rather, the scope of the invention is defined by the following claims.  We therefore claim as our invention all that comes within the scope and spirit of these claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

 'patent_description': u'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to an improved interlocking nail geometry and method for use; and more particularly to an interlocking nail having an hourglass-shaped construction with an optional self-tapping tapered locking design.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Animals and humans often suffer from long bone fractures, such as fractures of the femur, tibia and humerus, which require medical intervention for stabilization.  Surgery is generally required and involves implantation of devices appointed to\nprovide stability for bone healing.  Reconstruction of long bone fractures is generally achieved utilizing various implant devices currently available in human and veterinary fields.  Varying levels of success are achieved through use of these\nconventional orthopedic devices based on their ability to stabilize the fracture and promote bone healing.\n Non-stability at the fracture site can result in delayed healing and, in some cases, non-union of the fracture, thereby requiring revision surgery.  In the latter scenario, fibrous tissue grows at the fracture site instead of bone, creating an\nunstable, painful limb.  Non-union cases require revision surgery using combinations of these devices, i.e., interlocking nails in adjunct with an external fixator device.  The common basis for resolving non-stability problems is to establish adequate\nresistance to bending and torsion through these device reconstructions, thereby preventing excessive motion at the fracture site and allowing the bone to bridge.\n Orthopedic devices currently utilized involve combinations of implant devices, including: (i) external fixation devices with pins; (ii) bone plates and screws; and (iii) interlocking nails and transverse bolts or screws.  (See FIGS. 1a, 1b, and\n1c herein).\n External fixation devices frequently fail to provide the requisite stability for proper bone healing, making use of these devices undesirable.  Problems with external fixation devices occur not only from stability, but are also due to infection,\nas the pins used to stabilize the fragments extend through the skin into the bone, resulting in potential pathways for bacteria.  Stability can be provided utilizing bone plates and screws, implantation of these devices requires invasive surgical\nprocedures.  Interlocking nails heretofore disclosed and utilized provide a less invasive approach than the bone plates and screws.  However most designs of these devices do not provide adequate resistance to bending and torsion, and result in delayed\nunion or non-unions due to micromotion of the construct.\n Current interlocking nails are inadequate in achieving stability due to the nail geometry and the fit between the screw and the nail.  Most nails are a straight rod design of consistent cross section, which creates higher stresses at the\nproximal and distal portions of the nail challenging the fixation.  If these fracture fixation issues can be resolved, interlocking nails have the potential to provide a less invasive surgical approach and yield proper bone stabilization to promote\nhealing.\n Notwithstanding the efforts of prior art workers to construct an efficient interlocking nail that stabilizes bone fractures and promotes healing, there remains a need in the art for an interlocking nail having a geometry that promotes stability\nand, at the same time, requires less invasive surgical implantation.  In addition, there is a need in the art for an interlocking nail having an hour-glass geometry and an optional rounded entry tip.  Further, there is an art-recognized need for an\ninterlocking nail having an hour-glass geometry and fixation holes provided with a self-tapping, tapered, locking design.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides an interlocking nail having an hour-glass geometry especially suited to stabilize bone fractures and promote healing.  An hour-glass geometry is utilized by the interlocking nail to increase stability and provide\nfor flexible entry into bone canals.  The hour-glass shape of the interlocking nail permits a less invasive surgical implantation than can be achieved with conventional implantation devices.  In addition, the hour-glass shaped interlocking nail contains\nan optional rounded tip that affords smoother entry of the nail, while minimizing further injury to the bone.  Fixation holes are provided within the hour-glass interlocking nail construction.  These fixation holes, or apertures, preferably comprise a\nself-tapping, tapered, locking design.\n The hour-glass interlocking nail geometry and method of use provide a novel design for an interlocking nail device.  Introduction into the canal of long bones is more readily achieved, thereby minimizing the insertion force.  The hour-glass\ngeometry utilized by the hour-glass interlocking nail is better suited to address a larger population of bone canal geometries, stressing the fracture site with known values within the healing process and preventing inadvertent perforation of the nail\nthrough the cortex of the bone.  Hour-glass nail geometry more appropriately distributes stresses and promotes better healing at the bone fracture.  The loading process produced by the hour-glass nail geometry correspondingly results in less stress at\nthe proximal and distal ends and a more biocompatible micromotion at the fracture, which helps to prevent loosening of the implantation device.\n The hour-glass interlocking nail includes a proximal section, a mid section, and a distal section.  Each section of the hour-glass interlocking nail has a diameter.  The proximal and distal sections have diameters larger than the mid section so\nthat the hour-glass interlocking nail has an hour-glass geometry.  In addition, the hour-glass interlocking nail comprises at least one fixation aperture located within either the proximal or distal section of the hour-glass interlocking nail.\n In one embodiment, the hour-glass interlocking nail\'s proximal and distal sections each have at least one fixation aperture.  Alternatively, the proximal and distal sections of the hour-glass interlocking nail each have two fixation apertures. \nThe fixation aperture may have a first aperture diameter and a second aperture diameter.  The first aperture diameter is larger than the second aperture diameter, so that the fixation aperture has a tapered locking mechanism integrated therein. \nAlternatively, the fixation aperture is adapted to receive a screw, bolt, peg, or the like.  The fixation aperture may further comprise grooves therein, appointed to engage with grooves on a screw, bolt, or peg, or the like.  The hour-glass interlocking\nnail may comprise a plurality of fixation apertures located within each of the proximal or distal sections.\n In another embodiment the distal section comprises a distal tip having an arc therein constructed to form a tip having at least one arc portion.  Alternatively, the distal section comprises a distal tip having a substantially arced tip\nconstructed to form a substantially radiused tip.  Optionally the distal section comprises a distal tip having at least one flat edge adapted to form a substantially sharp tip.\n The proximal section may comprise a proximal end comprising a connector adapted to be utilized for insertion and alignment of the hour-glass interlocking nail into a bone canal.  The connector further comprises at least one ridge portion, at\nleast one cut-out portion, and a central aperture.  The central aperture extends through the proximal end and traverses into the proximal section.  Optionally, the central aperture is threaded and adapted to receive a bit for insertion and alignment of\nthe hour-glass interlocking nail into the bone canal.\n Instead of the connector comprising at least one ridge portion, cut-out portion, and central aperture, the connector may alternatively comprise a conical fitting projecting from the proximal end.  The conical fitting may comprise at least one\nflat side.  The conical fitting having the at least one flat side is utilized for positioning and rotational control of the hour-glass interlocking nail during insertion and alignment.\n In another embodiment, the proximal section has a proximal diameter, the distal section has a distal diameter, and the mid section has a first, second, and central diameter.  The proximal and distal sections each have a diameter larger than the\nmid section.  In turn, the first and second diameters of the mid section are larger than the central diameter of the mid section.  The mid section is appointed to flex when the hour-glass interlocking nail is inserted into a bone canal having a curved\ngeometry.\n A method of using an hour-glass interlocking nail having an hour-glass geometry is provided.  The method comprises the first step of examining a bone fracture to determine an appropriate sized hour-glass interlocking nail to be utilized. \nAppropriate length and diameter of the hour-glass interlocking nail are determined when selecting the hour-glass interlocking nail.  The fractured bone has a bone canal with bone cortex interstitially therein.  The method further comprises selecting the\nhour-glass interlocking nail.  The hour-glass interlocking nail comprises a proximal section, mid section, and distal section.  Each section of the hour-glass interlocking nail has a diameter and the proximal and distal sections each have a diameter\nlarger than the mid section so that the hour-glass interlocking nail has an hour-glass geometry.  At least one fixation aperture is located within either the proximal or distal section of the hour-glass interlocking nail.  The proximal section comprises\na proximal end having a connector adapted to be utilized for insertion and alignment of the hour-glass interlocking nail into the bone canal.\n At least one locking means is selected.  The locking means is appointed to be received by the fixation aperture located within either the proximal or distal section of the hour-glass interlocking nail.  The locking means comprises a first end,\ncenter, and a second end.  A substantial portion of the hour-glass interlocking nail is inserted into the bone canal.  An alignment device is attached to the connector of the proximal end of the hour-glass interlocking nail.  The bone is penetrated with\nthe locking means, causing the locking means to enter the fixation aperture.  A first end of the locking means extends from the hour-glass interlocking nail and traverses into the bone cortex.  At the same time, the center of the locking means becomes\nhoused within the fixation aperture, and the second end of the locking means extends from the hour-glass interlocking nail and traverses into the bone cortex opposite the first end.

Introduction into the canal of long bones is more readily achieved, thereby minimizing the\ninsertion force.  The hour-glass geometry utilized by the hour-glass interlocking nail is better suited to address a larger population of bone canal geometries, stressing the fracture site with known values within the healing process and preventing\ninadvertent perforation of the nail through the cortex of the bone.  Hour-glass nail geometry more appropriately distributes stresses and promotes better healing to the bone fracture.  This loading process via the geometry correspondingly results in less\nstress at the proximal and distal ends, and a more biocompatible micromotion at the fracture helping to prevent loosening of the implantation device.  The term ILN, as used herein, refers to interlocking nail.  The term HR-ILN, as used herein, refers to\nthe novel hour-glass interlocking nail of the subject invention.\n The hour-glass interlocking nail geometry and method of use comprises geometry with an area moment of inertia (AMI) consistent with the AMI of bone plates which have successfully demonstrated the achievement of sufficient stability for fracture\nfixation.  This AMI, relative to the AMI of successful bone plates, is established at the center of the nail and the resulting fracture site.  The term AMI, as used herein, refers to the area moment of inertia.\n FIGS. 1a, 1b, and 1c illustrate fractional fixation devices currently used in human and veterinary orthopedics.  Specifically, FIG. 1a shows a top view of a bone plate and screw combination currently utilized to repair bone fractures; FIG. 1b\nshows currently utilized interlocking nails and transverse bolts or screws; and FIG. 1c shows currently utilized external fixation devices with pins.  These orthopedic devices are currently utilized to repair bone fractures.  As set forth hereinabove in\nthe "Description of Prior Art Section", these devices have several disadvantageous.  Including, failing to provide the requisite stability for optimal bone healing and frequency in non-union cases, and thereby requiring revision surgery.  Plate and screw\ncombinations currently utilized result in invasive surgical procedures, which can increase the patient\'s healing time as well as risk of infection during the operating procedure.  External fixation devices frequently fail to provide the requisite\nstability and also can lead to infection as the pins used to stabilize the fragments extend through the skin into the bone, resulting in potential pathways for bacteria.  Interlocking nails currently utilized provide a less invasive approach than the\nbone plates and screws, however most designs of these devices do not provide adequate resistance to bending and torsion and result in delayed union or non-unions due to micro motion of the construct.\n FIGS. 2a and 2b illustrate conventionally utilized interlocking nails having straight nail rigid geometry and sharp point construction, and further illustrate stress distribution and disadvantageous of the combination of straight nail geometry\nand sharp point construction during insertion of the interlocking nail into a bone canal.  FIG. 2a shows a side view of a conventional interlocking nail; FIG. 2b shows insertion of the conventional interlocking nail into a bone cavity.  Conventional\ninterlocking nails generally have a rigid straight construction appointed with a sharp point and fixation holes.  Current interlocking nails are inadequate in achieving stability due to the nail geometry and the fit between the screw and the nail.  Most\nnails are a straight rod design of consistent cross section, which creates higher stresses at the proximal and distal portions of the nail, challenging fixation and interrupting bone healing.  If these fixation issues can be resolved, interlocking nails\nhave the potential to provide a less invasive surgical approach and yield proper bone stabilization to promote healing.  Flexible interlocking nail geometry is also important to the reconstruction of a fractured bone.  Insertion force must be applied to\novercome the bending moment of the nail.  During insertion into curved long bones, stiffer nail designs resist adequate flexing.  As a result, the fractured bone is forced to conform to the nail\'s geometry rather than the nail conform to the bone\'s\ngeometry.  Sharp tips utilized by conventional interlocking nails create high stress to the fractured bone and can perforate the cortex during insertion.\n FIG. 3 illustrates a top planer view of the hour-glass interlocking nail geometry of the subject invention, wherein the hour-glass interlocking nail has a non-rigid geometry and rounded tip construction and self-tapping tapered locking design\nshown generally at 10.  FIG. 4a illustrates a side view of the hour-glass interlocking nail having a non-rigid geometry and rounded tip construction and self-tapping tapered locking design, shown generally at 30.  Hour-glass interlocking nail 10, 30\ncomprises a proximal section 11, mid section 12, and distal section 13.  Each section, 11, 12, and 13 of the hour-glass interlocking nail has a diameter.  The proximal and distal sections, 11 and 13, each have a diameter larger than the mid section 12 so\nthat the hour-glass interlocking nail has hour-glass geometry.\n Hour-glass interlocking nail 10, 30 comprises at least one fixation aperture 14 located within either the proximal or distal section, 11, 13.  Preferably, fixation aperture 14 is tapered and has a locking design (discussed hereinafter).

(Discussed in further detail via FIGS. 4c and 4d). \nInstead of the connector comprising at least one ridge portion, cut-out portion, and central aperture, the connector may alternatively comprise a conical fitting projecting from the proximal end.  This alternative embodiment is shown in FIGS. 5a and 5b\nand same is discussed hereinbelow.\n FIG. 4b illustrates a cross-sectional view of a preferred embodiment of the fixation aperture taken along line X of FIG. 4a, wherein the fixation aperture comprises a self-tapping tapered locking design, shown generally at 40.  As best\nillustrated in FIG. 4b, fixation aperture 14 has a first aperture diameter 41 and a second aperture diameter 42.  First aperture diameter 41 is larger than second aperture diameter 42 so that the fixation aperture 14 has a tapered configuration.  This\ntapered configuration is integrated within the hour-glass interlocking nail 30 and acts as a locking mechanism for securing the hour-glass interlocking nail to the bone cortex.  Fixation aperture 14 is appointed to receive a tapered screw, screw-cone peg\nlocking device, screw, bolt, peg, or the like for fixture of the hour-glass interlocking nail within the bone.

Instead, the connector may alternatively comprise a conical\nfitting projecting from the proximal end.  This alternative embodiment is shown in FIGS. 5a and 5b and same is discussed hereinbelow.\n FIGS. 4c and 4d illustrate cross-sectional views of the proximal end 20 and connector 21.  FIG. 4c shows the proximal end 20 and connector 21 taken along line V, shown generally at 100.  FIG. 4d shows the proximal end 20 and connector 21 taken\nalong section VI and line VII, shown generally at 110.  Proximal end 20 is provided with connector 21.

An alternative embodiment of the connector is shown in FIGS. 5a and 5b and same is discussed hereinbelow.\n FIGS. 5a and 5b illustrate views of the hour-glass interlocking nail having a non-rigid geometry and rounded tip construction, and further illustrate an alternative embodiment wherein the connector comprises a conical fitting projecting from the\nproximal end, shown generally at 150 and 180, respectively.  FIG. 5b is shown at 180 and is taken along section A of FIG. 5a.  In this embodiment, hour-glass interlocking nail 151 comprises a proximal section 152, mid section 153, and distal section 154. Each section, 152, 153, and 154 of the hour-glass interlocking nail has a diameter.  The proximal and distal sections, 152 and 154, each have a diameter larger than the mid section 153 so that the hour-glass interlocking nail has hour-glass geometry. \nHour-glass interlocking nail 151 comprises at least one fixation aperture 155 located within either the proximal or distal section, 152, 154.  Preferably, fixation aperture 155 is tapered and has a locking design (discussed hereinafter).  In one\nembodiment the hour-glass interlocking nail\'s proximal and distal sections, 152, and 154, each have at least one fixation aperture 155.  Preferably the hour-glass interlocking nail 151 comprises a plurality of fixation apertures 155 located within each\nof the proximal and/or distal sections 152, 154, and/or throughout the mid section 153.  Most preferably, the proximal and distal sections, 152 and 154, of the hour-glass interlocking nail 151 each have two fixation apertures as is shown.\n Proximal section 152 comprises a proximal end 156 having a connector 157 constructed interstitially therein.  Connector 157 is appointed to be utilized for insertion and alignment of the hour-glass interlocking nail 151 into a bone canal.  In\nthe embodiment shown, connector 157 further comprises a conical fitting 158 projecting or outwardly extending from proximal end 156.  In this embodiment, connector 157 is appointed to be received in an orifice or aperture of an instrument appointed for\naligning and inserting the hour-glass nail 151 into the bone canal.  Conical fitting 158 may comprise at least one flat side 159 for advancing positioning and rotational control of the hour-glass interlocking nail during insertion and alignment into the\nbone canal.  Preferably, conical fitting 158 comprises two flat sides 159 arranged parallel to one another.  The conical fitting 158 may be threaded for attachment to an alignment/inserter.  The connector 157 is conical for locking to the alignment\nand/insertion instrument and has the side flats for positioning and rotational control during insertion.  An indent 181 (shown in FIG. 5b) may be included on conical fitting 158 for further facilitating placement within an insertion or aligning\ninstrument.\n FIGS. 6a, 6b, and 6c illustrate side views of the hour-glass interlocking nail having a non-rigid geometry and rounded tip construction.  Specifically, FIG. 6a shows a side view of the hour-glass interlocking nail, illustrating stress\ndistribution, radiused or semi-spherical bullet point tip, and hour-glass construction, shown generally at 70; FIG. 6b shows a side view of the hour-glass interlocking nail wherein the nail has a narrower mid section 12, shown generally at 80; and FIG.\n6c shows advantages of the hour-glass interlocking nail geometry during insertion of the interlocking nail into a bone canal, shown generally at 90.  Taken from the center 71 of mid section 72, the geometry of the nail 70 gradually increases extending\nfrom both sides until establishing two larger diameters at the proximal section 73 and distal section 74 provided with fixation apertures 75.  Proximal section 73 has a proximal diameter, the distal section 74 has a distal diameter, and the mid section\nhas a first, second, and central diameter.  The proximal and distal sections 73, 74 each have a diameter larger than the mid section 72.  The mid section is adapted to flex when the hour-glass interlocking nail is inserted into a bone canal having a\ncurved geometry.\n Distal section 74 is provided with a substantially radiused bullet point tip 76.  This hour-glass geometry can be accomplished through a large radius or by tapering the nail from the center 71 out to larger proximal and distal sections. \nProximal and distal sections are adapted to incorporate screw or bolt holes proving a method of locking the nail to the proximal and distal areas of the bone relative to the fracture site.  FIG. 6b shows a more narrowed center 81 of mid section 82 so\nthat there are virtually tapered cones on both sides of the center 81, increasing in radius on both sides to form proximal and distal sections, 83 and 84, and yield hour-glass geometry.  Proximal and distal sections 83, 84 are provided with fixation\napertures 85.  Distal section 84 is provided with a substantially radiused bullet point tip 86.\n Hour-glass geometry of the interlocking nail and the designed bullet point promote optimal insertion into the bone canal.  Insertion into the bone canal can be achieved without reaming, providing for a less invasive surgical procedure.  The use\nof thinner interlocking nails without reaming of the medullary cavity has biological advantages, such as preservation of the endosteal and medullary blood supply; however, thin INLs procedure places the construct at a mechanical disadvantage by reducing\nthe nail-bone contact area and increasing the working length of the locking device.  The HR-INL provides the ability to reduce the need for reaming, while at the same time aids in preserving the endosteal and medullary blood supply within the bone.  See\nFIG. 6c.  Bullet point tip (semi-spherical) construction at the end of the distal section also provides an insurance against inadvertent perforation of the bone canal during insertion, as is often seen with traditional sharp point interlocking nail tips. (Compare FIGS. 2b and 6c).\n The geometry of the hour-glass ILN (HR-ILN) conforms to the natural geometry of the internal canal of bones and promotes bone healing.  Insertion of the nail is also improved through the hour-glass geometry by allowing the nail to better flex at\nits center point 99 in length (FIG. 6c).  FIG. 6c shows insertion of the interlocking nail into a bone canal at 90.  Force is applied as HR-ILN 91 is inserted into a bone canal 92, HR-ILN 91 bends or flexes as indicated by arrows 93 at center point 99. \nFIG. 6c illustrates the geometry of the hour-glass nail during insertion.  HR-ILN 91 includes mid section 94 with narrow center point 99, proximal section 95, and distal section 96 baying radiused bullet tip 97.  Fixation apertures 98 are provided.  The\nnarrow diameter of mid section 94 at center point 99 facilitates bending of the HR-ILN 91 so that the nail can flex to insert into curved geometry of bone canal 92 with less stress to the bone and the HR-MN 91.\n Conventional nails\' consistent diameters create additional required insertion loads to overcome the bending stresses due to the curvature of the bone canal.  As a result, greater force must be applied when insertion of the conventional nail is\nrequired.  Reaming is often required when utilizing the conventional interlocking nail.  The hour-glass geometry of the novel interlocking nail herein provides benefit of insertion with less necessity for reaming.  At the same time, the hour-glass\ngeometry provides ease of insertion into the bone canal, and can minimize the pressure to the endosteum and improve the re-establishment of the medullary blood supply.  These features can enhance the bone healing process.  The HR-ILN geometry also\nprovides a more balanced stress distribution to the bone.  Fixation is achieved through the screws or bolts in the proximal and distal sections of the nail for bone attachment.  In a straight consistent cross sectional nail, these ends are exposed to\nhigher stresses and therefore challenge the fixation of the nail to the bone from inception.\n The hour-glass geometry re-directs these stresses to the fracture site, which is still capable of resisting deflection and excess micro motion based on the AMI of the center section.  Transferring these stresses, minimizes the stress to the\nfixation ends thereby providing for a more designed stress distribution capable of better fixation and fracture healing.  The basic shape of the hour-glass also eliminates any abrupt changes in geometry which would be seen from a geometry providing\nlarger ends for fixation with a reduced center section to the nail.\n FIG. 7 illustrates the hour-glass interlocking nail shown in FIGS. 4a-4d having a non-rigid geometry with rounded tip construction and self-tapping tapered locking design, illustrating mechanical measurements for a 160 mm nail, shown generally\nat 400.  The hour-glass interlocking nail has a rounded tip 401.  Tapered locking design of the fixation aperture is shown at 402, and the embodiment of the connector having at least one ridge portion (preferably at least two) and at least one cut-out\nportion (preferably at least two) as illustrated in FIGS. 4a-4d is shown at 403 and 404.\n FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate side views of derivations of the hour-glass interlocking nail of the current invention.  Specifically, these figures show a less gradual indentation.  FIG. 8 shows a reduced mid-section or sharp point design embodiment,\nshown generally at 200.  A view of the tapered fixation aperture is also shown, along with views of the connector and tip detail.  Herein, the distal end has a pointed or sharp point design tip 201.  Sharp tip 201 has at least one flat edge 202a to form\na substantially sharp tip.  Herein, sharp tip 201 has three flat sides to form a pyramidal sharp tip shown at 202.  FIG. 9 shows a reduced mid-section or rounded or bullet point design 301 embodiment, shown generally at 300.  FIGS. 8 and 9 are drawings\nof similar devices but without encompassing all the benefits of the hour-glass geometry.  Although the cross section of the hour-glass ILN is shown as a circle, it is also envisioned that different cross sections such as a "Y" or an "X" could provide\nsimilar benefits in an hour-glass nail geometry.  Initial stability of the hour-glass nail can be achieved through the fixation apertures in the larger diameter cylinders at each end (proximal and distal sections).  These fixation apertures can be\ndesigned to accept screws, bolts, screw-cone pegs, threaded or non-threaded with the intent of solid fixation to the nail and fixation to the cortices of the bone.  This secured fixation between the nail and the bone provides the opportunity for the nail\ngeometry to afford the proper biomechanics for fracture fixation.\n Clinical observation was done utilizing 8-mm ILN (hereinafter, ILN8) to treat comminuted fractures of the tibial diaphysis in dogs of mixed-breed, weighing approximately 30 to 35 kg.  Prototypes of the HR-ILN (hour-glass interlocking nail of the\npresent invention) system were designed to be of a size comparable to commercially available 8.times.185-mm ILN.  Several primary constraints were addressed in designing the HR-ILN prototypes, including: providing a rigid interaction between the bone and\nthe HR-ILN; and providing a shape that would limit interference with endocortices and facilitate fracture reduction while limiting the risk of joint infraction attributed to perforation of the implant device.  In addition, the shape and size of the novel\nHR-ILN addressed surgical insertion constraints, making insertion easier while mitigating the need for reaming.\n The prototypical HR-ILN further addresses secondary constraints of current ILNs, including stiffness and strength issues.  The HR-ILN includes a locking device that provides rigid interaction with the nail via tapered fixation apertures, as well\nas the connector adapted to ensure proper alignment and insertion of the fixation means (i.e. screws, etc.).  The AMI of the HR-WLN is greater than that of a 45-mm bone screw and comparable to that of a commercially available 3.5-mm locking bolt.  The\nfixation hole or aperture was designed to be similar to an ILN8 with 3.5-mm bone screws.  Prototypes of the HR-ILN were developed having the hour-glass shaped nail featuring an oblong bullet like distal tip and a screw-cone peg locking device. \nManufacture of the prototypes was from 316L stainless-steel certified to ASTM F138 standards.  The material was chosen because it is the current material of choice for medical manufacturers of similar implants.  The patent contemplates use of any\nsuitable material.  The outside diameter of the nail ends (proximal and distal) was 8 mm and the center of the mid section was 6 mm at is center.  Each proximal and distal section of the nail included two fixation holes, tapered and having a diameter of\n40 and 32, respectively.  The tapered fixation holes were placed 11 mm apart in each end of the nail.  The most proximal and distal nail holes were separated by 155.5 mm.  The screw-cone peg was designed as a self-tapping, cortical-type screw with a\ncentral Morse taper that corresponded to the fixation holes or apertures.  The core diameter of the screw-cone peg was 4 mm and was manufactured in tow lengths, 26 and 30 mm.\n FIG. 10 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the hour-glass interlocking nail of FIG. 6b wherein a plurality of fixation apertures is located throughout the mid section.\n A method of using an hour-glass interlocking nail having an hour-glass geometry is provided.  The method comprises the first step of examining a bone fracture to determine an appropriate sized hour-glass interlocking nail to be utilized. \nAppropriate length and diameter of the hour-glass interlocking nail is determined in selecting the hour-glass interlocking nail.  The fractured bone has a bone canal with bone cortex interstitially therein.  The method further comprises selecting the\nhour-glass interlocking nail.  The hour-glass interlocking nail comprises a proximal section, mid section, and distal section.  Each section of the hour-glass interlocking nail has a diameter and the proximal and distal sections each have a diameter\nlarger than the mid section so that the hour-glass interlocking nail has an hour-glass geometry.  At least one fixation aperture is located within either the proximal or distal section of the hour-glass interlocking nail.  The proximal section comprises\na proximal end having a connector adapted to be utilized for insertion and alignment of the hour-glass interlocking nail into the bone canal.\n At least one locking means is selected.  The locking means is appointed to be received by the fixation aperture located within either the proximal or distal section of the hour-glass interlocking nail.  The locking means comprises a first end,\ncenter, and a second end.  A substantial portion of the hour-glass interlocking nail is inserted into the bone canal.  An alignment device is attached to the connector of the proximal end of the hour-glass interlocking nail.  The bone is penetrated with\nthe locking means, wherein the locking means enters the fixation aperture.  The locking mean\'s first end extends from the hour-glass interlocking nail and traverses into the bone cortex, while the locking means center is housed within the fixation\naperture and the second end of the locking means extends from the hour-glass interlocking nail and traverses into the bone cortex opposite the first end.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

{'abstract': u' A load bearing implant comprising a femoral implant stem made from a\n     bio-compatible metal having an elastic modulus far greater than that of\n     natural bone. When the implant heals within a bone cavity, the implant\n     essentially carries substantially the entire load. Transfer of load to\n     the surrounding bone tissue is lost due to lack of use after healing.\n     Flexing a stiff implant applies a large load at the implant distal end.\n     The bone cortex is thereby allowed to thicken, causing thigh pain long\n     after implant healing. The femoral implant has a bone ingrowth coating on\n     the proximal end, allowing firm attachment of the implant in the bone\n     cavity. The distal end has a central aperture and a helical machined\n     groove that permits flexing of the distal portion of the femoral implant\n     stem. This flexing occurs in a manner similar to surrounding bone tissue,\n     preventing thigh pain.\n ',

 'patent_description': u"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to implants; and more particularly to an implant that has flexural characteristics and load bearing qualities similar to a natural bone thereby preventing bone loss surrounding the implant due to lack of bone load\nbearing requirements.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Implants are generally made from bio-compatible materials such as titanium alloys or cobalt chromium alloys.  These metallic implants have very high elastic modulus as compared to bone tissue.  As a result, any load that is applied is almost\nentirely carried by the high elastic modulus material sparing the bone of its load bearing function.  This results in bone thinning after the implant has healed.  A number of prior art patents disclose attempts to solve this problem.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,743,263 to Petrtyl et al. discloses an adaptable isoelastic hip-endoprosthesis.  The adaptable isoelastic hip endoprosthesis comprises a joint piece connected to a shaft of the endoprosthesis that is to be implanted in the\nfemur.  The shaft is composed of at least two spirally twisted elastic rods.  The elastic rods at their lower end are mutually connected to act as stabilization bodies.  The adaptable isoelastic hip-endoprosthesis disclosed by the '263 patent is a\ntwisted spiral rod construction which applies force to the prepared bone cavity providing implant stability.  When the scar is healed, the spring-like implant is said to form a unitary elastic object.  However, the elastic modulus of the rods is very\ndissimilar to that of bone and the bone may not fuse to the implant due to the absence of a porous bone ingrowth surface.  Application of any compressive force to the implant results in further expansion of the twisted rods resulting in permanent\nenlargement of the bone cavity, which will dislodge the implant.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,851,008 to Johnson discloses a bone implant prosthesis with a substantially stress-free outer surface.  This bone implant prosthesis has an outer stress-free surface and a subsurface carried generally beneath and parallel to\nthe outer surface, for bearing tensile stresses.  The prosthesis includes a plurality of slots undercutting the outer surface of the prosthesis thus forming a stress bearing subsurface that frees the outer surface from substantial tensile stresses.  The\nstress-free outer surface is readily adaptable to receive a porous coating that enhances bone ingrowth without decreasing the stress resistance characteristics of the prosthesis.  The sub-surface is substantially smooth and free of stress concentration\nsites.  The cross bar portions connecting T-shaped slots defines a stress-bearing, discontinuous, smooth subsurface generally parallel to and spaced beneath the outer surface of the prosthesis.  The bone implant prosthesis disclosed by the '008 patent\nutilizes a row of T shaped slots formed by passing an electrode through the bone implant prosthesis melting a straight line path layer over the outer surface with T slots, a high modulus surface.  When the implant is flexed, the distal portion of the\nimplant still carries all of the flexural load and therefore does not prevent bone thinning.  The portions of the implant through which the electrodes are not passed provides highly stressed areas and the T shaped portions only occupy a minority portion\nof the overall implant surface.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,549,702 to Ries et al. discloses a flexible orthopaedic stem apparatus.  This orthopaedic prosthesis for implantation in a patient's intramedullary canal includes a rigid proximal portion sized and shaped to fit the\nintramedullary canal of a patient's bone and a lower elongated stem member with an outer surface and distal end.  The lower stem member has a helical groove of varying width and depth on the outer surface and a hollowed tapered central core cooperating\nto enable flexing of the distal end.  The flexible orthopaedic stem apparatus of the '072 disclosure has an implant with its distal portion having a helical groove on its surface of varying width and depth while the interior of the stem has a conical\ncore that increases in diameter as it progresses towards the distal tip.  This means that the thickness of the distal end decreases to very small value near the distal tip and may permanently deform the implant within the bone after insertion failing to\nprovide adequate support during implant healing.  Besides, the permanently deformed tip of the implant may create enormous pain to the patient.  The rigid proximal portion of the implant is not indicated to have a porous bone ingrowth coating.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,093,209 to Sanders discloses a proximally hollow prosthesis.  The proximally hollow prosthesis has a cap element and a stem.  The prosthesis cap element is adapted to a ball and a stem suitable to be implanted in a reamed\nfemoral medullary canal.  The stem of the prosthesis has a proximal region and a distal region and is mateable with the cap element of the prosthesis.  The proximal region has a circumferential wall defining a hollow cavity terminating to an open\nproximal end.  The hollow cavity has a predetermined length keeping the cavity entirely within proximal region of the stem sufficient to allow the stem to flex, The distal region of the stem is located distal to the isthmus region of the stem and is made\nof solid metal or alloys.  Any flexure of this implant strictly relies on the small wall thickness at the proximal cavity, but the large diameter at the proximal portion has a high moment of inertia providing very little flexing action since the metal or\nalloy used has a high elastic modulus.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,245,112 to Doubler et al. discloses a joint prosthesis having variable flexibility.  The joint prosthesis has a coil spring at its lower end supported by a control rod, which applies compression to the coil spring.  Since the\ncentral rod supports all the flexibility of the spring, the flexibility of the entire implant is only dependent on the flexibility of the control rod.  Since the control rod is held in place securing the spring, any movement in these attachment means\nwill result in unsupported non recoverable movement of the spring.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,723,129 to Dwyer et al. discloses a self-locking modular prosthesis having taper feature and associated method.  The modular femoral prosthesis includes a stem member adapted to be implanted into a medullary canal of a femur. \nThe stem member has a continuously tapered elongated bore and a threaded aperture defined therein.  A first end of the elongated bore defines a post-receiving opening.  The post-receiving opening is defined in a proximal end surface of the stem member. \nThe elongated bore extends between the post-receiving opening and a threaded aperture.  The femoral prosthesis also includes a neck member having a neck body, and a head-receiving support member secured to the neck body so as to extend outwardly there\nfrom.  A tapered post is also secured to the neck body so as to extend outwardly there from.  The tapered post is adapted to be received into the elongated bore of the stem member.  The tapered post of the stem member has a proximal end and a distal end,\nand the tapered post is continuously tapered from said proximal end thereof to said distal end.  The distal stem component may be provided in a number of different configurations in order to fit the needs of a given patient's anatomy and provide a\nvariety of fixation options (e.g. textures and geometries) and sizes.  Moreover, the distal stem component may also be provided in a bow-shaped configuration if required by a given patient's anatomy.  This modular implant is not flexible, but is\npermanently bent according to the femoral cavity shape of the patient.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0111692 to Ralph et al. discloses an artificial hip having a femoral stem portion, which provides for micromovement.  The femoral stem member is for use in an artificial hip implant assembly and\ncomprises a shaft portion having a proximal end and a distal end.  The distal end is shaped for insertion into the axial bore of a patient's femor.  The proximal end includes a ball-shaped surface for insertion into a receiving cup disposed in an\nacetabular recess in said patient's pelvis.  A helical cut is formed in the proximal shaft portion or distal shaft portion such that the helically cut segment of the shaft portion has an elastic modulus.  The elastic modulus is substantially less than\nthat of the remaining portions of the stem and approximates that of the patient's bone.  The helical cuts form a restoring force spring-like shock absorbing geometry, which permits the rigid metal material to grossly conform to the elastic modulus of the\npatient's bone.  The helical cut is formed in a segment of the proximal end or distal end of the shaft portion and has a polymer sheath that prevents the patient's bone ingrowth into the helical cuts, thus preventing interference with the geometric\nmodification of the overall modulus of elasticity of the helically cut segment.  The polymer sheath prevents bone ingrowth and attachment of the implant to the bone.  The shaft is solid and does not have a central constant diameter aperture facilitating\nthe bending of the shaft at the distal end.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0107001 to Cheal et al discloses a joint prostheses and components thereof.  The joint prostheses of the '001 patent application provides a modular femoral stem that may be rotated after insertion\nand its neck length adjusted.  The fluting or ridge formation in the mid section of the stem is indicated to allow rotation of the implant during insertion and may provide increased flexibility.  It is not clear how a longitudinal flute or slot provides\nany flexibility to any portion of the stem.  The '001 patent disclosure does not provide a stem with a proximal potion having bone ingrowth coating and a distal end having a central cylindrical aperture and a helical slot cut in the outer surface to\nallow flexing of the stem at its distal end.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0233095 to Schlaepfer discloses a device for dynamic stabilization of bones or bone fragments.  The device for dynamic stabilization of bones or bone fragments comprises an anchor member for\nattachment to vertebrae having an opening configured to receive a longitudinal member and the longitudinal member being viscoelastically deformable and having a predetermined bending resilience.  This stabilization structure stabilizes the spinal column\nof a patient.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0161931 to Perez-Cruet et al. discloses a vertebral disc annular fibrosis tensioning and lengthening device.  The vertebral disc annular fibrosis tensioning and lengthening device restores the loss\nof disc height as a result of disc degeneration and other factors.  The vertebral disc annular fibrosis tensioning and lengthening device includes pedicle screws having heads with cup-shaped cavities.  The pedicle screws are threaded into the vertebral\nbodies of adjacent vertebrae through the pedicles so that open parts of the heads of the pedicle screws face each other.  A spring is inserted into the cup-shaped cavities in compression so that the spring bias forces the pedicle screws apart, thus\nincreasing the height of the disc space.  The disclosed device is not a femoral stem.\n Foreign Patent Application No. GB2078523, also U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,314,381 to Koeneman discloses a hip joint prosthesis.  The hip joint prosthesis in which the stem portion of the femoral head prosthesis includes at least one layer of elastomeric\nmaterial disposed between and attaching to at least two sections of rigid material to reduce necrosis and resorption of the adjacent bone.  The hip joint prosthesis of the '523 patent application is a stem with two or four metal stem pieces with an\nelastomer sandwiched between them.  This arrangement is indicated to prevent bone resorption due to the reduction of the stiffness of the implanted stem.  Specifically, the stem of the '523 patent application does not have a helical slot formed on the\nouter surface of the distal portion of the stem providing flexibility only at the distal end.  Also, the stem of the '523 application is solid and does not have a central cylindrical aperture.\n There remains a need in the art for implants of different geometry made from bio-compatible high elastic modulus alloys that can be inserted into bone cavity that does not result in patient pain after the implant has healed and does not result\nin bone tissue loss due to excess load bearing capacity of the high modulus sparing the bone tissue from its load carrying functionality.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides improved load bearing implants comprising a taper fitting with a locking taper, a neck-collar area to provide an anatomical distance compatible with soft tissue, a proximal body and distal body, The proximal body\nhaving a macro porous surface for bone ingrowth preferably comprising longitudinal cuts for stress reduction, and a hollow distal stem that has flexural cuts along the shaft, having a hollow centerline.  The flexural cuts are a distance apart to prevent\nadjacent surfaces from touching.  The flexural cuts comprise a combination of spiral, longitudinal and/or horizontal cuts.  The flexural cuts are machined and may be in the form of helical cuts, longitudinal or horizontal cuts.\n The present invention involves improved load bearing implants, as described below.  Particularly, the load bearing implants generally comprise: (i) a taper fitting having a locking taper which provides for a head to attach, wherein said head has\nan internal female taper that locks onto a femoral implant stem; (ii) a neck-collar area providing an anatomical distance between a center of said head and a position of said implant during implantation so as to provide appropriate stretch for soft\ntissue; (iii) a femoral stem comprising a proximal portion generally having a macro porous surface adapted for bone ingrowth; (iv) said proximal portion having longitudinal cuts to reduce the stress level at the implant proximal location and transferring\nstress to the proximal bone body thereby preventing long term bone resorption; (v) a femoral stem having a tapered distal portion that has a cylindrical constant diameter hole or aperture with a wall thickness decreasing towards the distal end; (vi) said\ndistal stem having lateral flexural cuts preferably in the form of a helix forming segments along its length providing flexure to said distal portion of the stem.  The tapered distal portion of the stem includes an aperture along a centerline allowing\nthe distal end and the lateral cuts to provide elastic flexure with a modulus of elasticity similar to the surrounding bone, and wherein said lateral flexural cuts are of a sufficient width and depth and spacing to prevent adjacent surfaces of said\nsegments from touching.  Preferably the flexural cuts form a spiral configuration yielding spiral segments along its length that provide flex to the hollow distal stem.  Additionally, the lateral flexural cuts may be combined with longitudinal cuts\nrelative to the implant centerline, or inclined cuts relative to the implant centerline, and/or a combination of spiral, longitudinal and/or inclined cuts.\n The improved load bearing implant, comprises:\n a. a femoral implant stem having a male locking tapered fitting adapted for attachment to a internal female taper of a head that locks the head to a femoral implant stem;\n b. a neck-collar area providing an anatomical distance between a center of said head and a position of said femoral implant stem during implantation so as to provide appropriate stretch for soft tissue;\n c. said femoral implant stem being made from biocompatible metal having a proximal portion and a tapered distal portion;\n d. said proximal portion of femoral implant stem being solid and coated with a bone ingrowth coating having an attachment feature for firm attachment to bone within a bone cavity;\n e. said proximal portion having a plurality of modulus decreasing features including longitudinal, inclined stress reducing cuts or slots thereby increasing load transfer to the bone area in the proximal region and preventing long term bone\nresorption;\n f. said tapered distal portion having a cylindrical, constant diameter, central aperture whereby the wall thickness in the distal portion decreases progressively towards the distal end;\n g. said tapered distal portion having a plurality of modulus decreasing features including lateral cuts or slots on the outer surface, preferably forming a continuous helix;\n h. said cuts or slots having a pre-selected uniform width and a uniform depth and being spaced apart at a distance from each other so that the slots, in combination with the central taper, allow flexing of the distal portion;\n whereby the combination of cuts or slots in the distal portion and central cylindrical aperture allow progressive flexing of the distal end, thereby minimizing excessive loading of the bone tissue, and appropriate selection of slots, depth of\nslots and spacing between slots prevents metal to metal contact on the adjacent surfaces of the cuts or slots during flexure, preventing generation of wear debris.\n The bone implant may be of other configurations taking advantage of the improved elastic modulus compliance with the bone tissue.  The implant configurations include hip stem for a total hip replacement, femoral head replacement for the hip,\nknee femoral component, knee tibial component, humeral component for a shoulder replacement, elbow replacement humeral component, bone plates and interlocking nails.

These implants include hip, knee, elbow, shoulder and ankle replacements.  The implant designs address two basic principles: (i) replacing the bearing\nsurface of the joint for motion; and (ii) providing a method of fixing the implant to the body.  The former design feature has evolved over the past fifty years to include various metals, plastics, ceramics and coatings, which provide low-friction\nmovement with minimal generation of wear debris.  These bearing surfaces include a cobalt chrome alloy against ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), titanium nitride coated metals against UHMWPE, ceramic against ceramic, metal against metal\nand combinations of these.  The results for these bearing surfaces continue to improve the longevity of these implant replacements.  Wear debris has been shown to cause bone resorption leading to loosening of the implant from the bone.  The latter design\nfeature of fixing the implant to the bone has been accomplished by two primary methods: (a) Bone cement (PMMA); (b) Bone ingrowth through porous surfaces (biologic fixation).\n There exists a need in the art for a biologic fixation of prostheses that eliminates the necessity for cement; this need has been recognized in many clinical cases by the orthopedic industry since the 1970's.  The option to stabilize an implant\nthrough ingrowth of bone or soft tissue provides a method to achieve long term fixation with biological material and eliminates complications associated with cement.\n Current methods for implant fixation are through a porous surface created by layers of sintered beads, plasma sprayed surface, titanium wire and other micro and macro surfaces providing for a mechanical lock with bone.  FIGS. 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D\nare photographs depicting different surfaces for bone growth attachment.  FIG. 1A illustrates Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) image of the plasma sprayed porous surface.  FIG. 1B illustrates an SEM image of sintered bead porous surface.  FIG. 1C\nillustrates an image of a fiber porous surface and FIG. 1D illustrates an image of a porous tantalum structure with interconnected porosity.  Most of these fixation surfaces are attached to a metal substrate (i.e. titanium, cobalt chrome), which has\nflexural modulus magnitudes well above that of bone.  Titanium has a modulus of 100-110 GPa (14,503,774 to 15,954,151 psi) while bone has at best a modulus of 20.7 GPa, (3,002,281 psi), which is about 20 percent of the modulus of the implant. \nCobalt-chromium alloy has an even higher modulus than titanium.  When load is applied to the implant, the implant shields the bone from receiving stress, which causes bone resorption.  The implant flexes very differently from the bone and therefore\napplies enormous pressures at the bone to when stress is applied to the bone requiring the bone to flex.\n Many clinical examples demonstrate adverse reactions of the bone due to an implant, which is too stiff.  Under load, the deformation of the implant is much smaller than that of the bone due to the high elastic modulus of the implant.  An implant\nwith engineered flexural properties would allow the bone to be loaded more physiologically.  Current implant technology provides implants, which are biocompatible but are much stiffer than the surrounding bone.  In these cases the surrounding bone can be\nunder stressed, sometimes causing bone resorption (body removes bone).  The stiffness can generate very high local stresses at the distal tip of the implant because of its inflexibility.  FIG. 2 illustrates an x-ray radiograph that clearly illustrates\nbone resorption when a stiff femoral hip stem is used especially over time due to stress shielding in the proximal bone and thickening of the distal cortices from over stressing at the stem tip.  In this x-ray radiograph shown is of a conventional bone\nimplant after one year of life.  The implant has healed in this time period but the bone tissue has been resorbed in the proximal region A of a well-healed implant due to stress shielding.  However, the portion B at the distal end of implant has bone\nthickening due to excessive flexural overstressing of the bone due to a stiff implant.  This scenario of highly localized stresses can cause patient thigh pain and increased bone formation in an attempt to deal with the increased stress.  The stem tip\nissue usually generates thigh pain during this remodeling and can still result in continued pain over one year following the original surgery.  An implant, which provides more physiological load transfer to the bone establishes improved long term\nfixation, better density and quality of the surrounding bone and an implant reconstruction which is less painful.  The high modulus of the implant stem prevents flexing of the implant and a very large load is applied to the bone at the distal end\ncreating bone thickening.  The thigh pain is caused by the bone thickening as well as loss of bone in the proximal region.  Eventually, the loss of bone in the proximal region is so severe that a larger femoral cavity has to be reamed out to implant a\nlarger femoral stem in the reamed cavity.\n FIG. 3a illustrates an embodiment of the improved load bearing implant, shown generally at 10.  FIGS. 3b-3d illustrate blow-up inclined and/or longitudinal cuts relative to the implant centerline in the proximal portion.  FIGS. 4A and 4B\n(collectively, FIG. 4) illustrates top plan view and top cross-sectional views, respectively, of the improved load bearing implant to better illustrate the design.  FIG. 4A shows the side view of the implant while FIG. 4B shows the top view of the\nimplant.  The implant 10 is preferably made from titanium.  The design can utilize spiral cuts in the material (as shown) in the distal stem portion, longitudinal (FIG. 3c; longitudinal cuts shown at 13'') or inclined (FIG. 3b; inclined cuts shown at\n13') cuts relative to the implant centerline in the proximal portion, and or a combination of these cuts (FIGS. 3d; 13'' and 13').  The proximal portion has a plurality of modulus decreasing features including longitudinal, inclined stress reducing cuts\nor slots, thereby increasing load transfer to the bone area in the proximal region.  The objective of the invention is to allow the loaded implant to flex in a similar manner as the bone normally does.  The flex cuts would be of sufficient width to\nprevent metal to metal contact when the implant is loaded.  preventing metal to metal contact, the design avoids the problem of metal wear debris being generated from the implant as it is loaded.\n The implant 10 has a similar geometry to other hip stems composed of a taper fitting 11, a neck-collar area 12, a proximal stem portion 13 and a distal stem portion 14 having flexural cuts 15 forming segments, herein spirals 16 along its length\nin the distal stem portion, providing flex to hollow distal stem 14.  The neck-collar area 12 is of adequate length to provide appropriate stretch for soft tissue.  Flexural cuts 15 are of a sufficient fixed selected width and depth to prevent adjacent\nsurfaces of the segments, in this illustration spirals 16, from touching.  Preferably, the flexural cuts 15 form a spiral configuration, as shown, yielding spiral segments along its length, providing flex to the hollow distal stem.  Alternatively, the\nflexural cuts 15 are longitudinal cuts relative to the implant centerline, or horizontal cuts relative to the implant centerline, and/or a combination of spiral, longitudinal and/or horizontal cuts.  The design of a more flexible femoral hip stem is\naccomplished through a hole 17 along the centerline of the stem 14 and with flexural cuts 15 forming spirals 16 along the stems length.  Both the hole 17 diameter and the pitch between the spiral cuts 15 can be adjusted to create different flexural\ncharacteristics depending on the application.  An important aspect of the flexural cuts is that they are of sufficient width for the application to prevent the adjacent surfaces from touching and potentially generating wear debris.\n While the conventional femoral hip stem is a solid piece of metal and is very stiff relative to the stiffness of the bone (100.times.  stiffer for cobalt chrome and 5 to 10.times.  stiffer for titanium 6Al-4V), the Improved Load Bearing Implant\nherein is hollow.  In order to bring the stem into better compliance with the bone, the stem portion is hollowed and has a spiral cut made along its length, as seen in FIG. 3, and FIG. 4.  This provides the implant with an ability to flex in this area\nlike a spring would.  This added flexural property could be specifically designed to be in close proximity to the natural bone thereby allowing for a more physiological stress transfer and better bone remodeling.\n The other benefits associated with the ability of the implant to flex are better fit to the internal canal geometry of the bone and reduction of stem tip stresses, as illustrated in FIG. 3.  The former has resulted in creating left and right\nimplants in many competitive systems in order for them to fit the internal canal.  The latter creates post-operative thigh pain created by high stresses at the stem tip.  The flex design of the stem can reduce or eliminate that problem.\n In addition to the femoral stem implant, this methodology of elimination of stress shielding as well as providing an implant modulus matching the bone modulus may be used in several geometries of bone implants.  FIG. 5A, FIG. 5B, FIG. 5c, FIG.\n5D, FIG. 5E, FIG. 5F, FIG. 5G and FIG. 5H depict use of stress relief features in implants of other geometry.  FIG. 5A depicts in detail, the elements of the present invention.  FIGS. 5B through 5H illustrate a number of examples of possible implants. \nSome of the examples do not have a central aperture, but sufficient cuts in various orientations are provided at appropriate width and depth, and spacing to provide desired flexural characteristics as well as preventing bone resorption.  Examples 5B\nthrough 5H detail different variants for implants with one or more of longitudinal, spiral cuts facilitating flexure as detailed in the present invention.  Examples include\n i. Hip stem for a total hip replacement (FIG. 5A);\n ii.  Femoral Head replacement for the hip (FIG. 5B);\n iii.  Knee femoral component (FIG. 5C);\n iv.  Knee tibial component (FIG. 5D);\n v. Humeral Component for a shoulder replacement (FIG. 5E);\n vi.  Elbow Replacement Humeral Component (FIG. 5F);\n vii.  Bone plates (FIG. 5G); and\n viii.  Interlocking nails (FIG. 5H)\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n",

 'patent_description': u'FIELD\n This disclosure relates to systems and methods for limiting the number of uses of cutting tools and determining the effective functional life of the same.\nBACKGROUND\n There are many surgical procedures which require the removal and/or cutting of bone in a patient.  Such procedures often involve the use of specific cutting tools.  For example, in some procedures, specific cutting tools can be provided to ream\nthe internal canal of bones for preparation of implants or to ream the outer surfaces of bones for preparation of implants and drilling holes for bone screw fixation.  Conventional cutting tools, however, generally provide no mechanism for identifying\nthe quality or state of the cutting tool.  As a result, many cutting tools are disadvantageously used until they no longer function properly.\nSUMMARY\n Various systems and methods for providing quality control of cutting tools are described herein.  In some embodiments, the number of uses of cutting tools can be restricted to ensure the quality of the cutting tool prior to its use for its\nintended purpose.  In other embodiments, the effective functional life of cutting tools can be analyzed and determined to ensure that the number of uses of the tool do not exceed the tool\'s effective functional life.\n In one embodiment, a cutting tool has a cutting surface on a first side of the cutting tool and an attachment member on a second side of the cutting tool.  The attachment member is configured to be coupled to a powered driving member.  The\ncutting tool includes a limiting device configured to restrict the use of the cutting tool to a predetermined number of uses.  In some embodiments, the limiting device can be configured to restrict the number of uses of the cutting tool by restricting\nthe number of times that the attachment member can be coupled to the powered driving member.\n The limiting device can include a counter that is configured to move to a new position each time the attachment member is coupled to the powered driving member.  The limiting device can include an activation member having a projection that is\nconfigured to engage with a surface of the powered driving member and a surface configured to engage with the counter.  The activation member can be configured to move between a first position when the attachment member is not coupled to the powered\ndriving member and a second position when the attachment member is coupled to the powered driving member.\n In some embodiments, a spring member can be provided in contact with the activation member to bias the activation member back towards the first position.  The attachment member can include a cross bar that extends across the second side of the\ncutting tool.  The cross bar can have an extension member that extends from a surface of the cross bar.  The counter can include an opening that extends at least partly through a portion of the counter, with the extension member being positioned to\nextend through the opening.  The counter can be configured to rotate with the extension member extending through the opening until the extension member contacts a side wall that defines a portion of the opening.  The opening can be sized to allow a\npredetermined number of incremental rotations of the counter relative to the cross bar until the extension member contacts the side wall and restricts further movement of the counter relative to the cross bar.\n In some embodiments, the first and second sides are on opposite sides of the cutting tool.  In some embodiments, the cutting tool can be an acetabular reamer.  In some embodiments, the predetermined number of uses can be representative of the\neffective functional life of the cutting tool.  In some embodiments, the counter comprises a longitudinally moveable member.\n In another embodiment, a cutting system is provided.  The system can include a cutting tool and a drive shaft.  The cutting tool can include a cutting surface on a first side of the cutting tool and an attachment member on a second side of the\ncutting tool.  The drive shaft can include a receiving area and a coupling member, with the receiving area being configured to receive the attachment member and the coupling member being configured to secure the cutting tool to the drive shaft.  The\ncutting tool can include an integrated limiting device configured to restrict the number of uses of the cutting tool by restricting the number of times that the attachment member can be coupled to the powered driving member.  In some embodiments, the\ncutting tool can be an acetabular reamer and the drive shaft can be a reamer shaft.\n The limiting device can include a counter member that is configured to rotate and/or translate longitudinally one increment to a new position each time the attachment member is coupled to the drive shaft.  The limiting device can also include an\nactivation member having a projection that is configured to engage with a surface of the drive shaft to move between a first position when the attachment member is not coupled to the drive shaft and a second position when the attachment member is coupled\nto the drive shaft.  The activation member can be positioned in contact with the counter member so that movement from the first position to the second position causes the counter member to advance the one increment.  The attachment member can include a\ncross bar, wherein the cross bar and the counter member are configured to engage with one another to permit a limited amount of relative movement between the cross bar and the counter member.  The limited amount of movement can comprise a predetermined\nnumber of increments.  The predetermined number of increments can be the number of uses of the cutting tool within its effective functional life.\n In other embodiments, a method of restricting the number of uses of a cutting tool is provided.  The method can include coupling an attachment member of a cutting tool to a receiving area of a powered driving member, with the coupling of the\nattachment member to the receiving area comprising rotating the cutting tool relative to the powered driving member.  The relative rotation of the cutting tool and powered driving member can cause an activation member on the cutting tool to contact a\nsurface of the powered driving member, with the contact of the activation member with the surface of the powered driving member causing the activation member to move from a first position to a second position.  A counter on the cutting tool can be\nincremented by the movement of the activation member from the first position to the second position.  The cutting tool can be removed from the receiving area of the powered driving member.  Further coupling of the attachment member to the receiving area\nof the powered driving member can be restricted once a predetermined number of incrementing steps have occurred.\n In some embodiments, the counter on the cutting tool comprises a counter gear that rotates one increment each time the activation member moves from the first position to the second position.  The restricting step can include restricting rotation\nof the counter gear once the predetermined number of incrementing steps have occurred.  The restricting of the rotation of the counter gear can be achieved, in some embodiments, by positioning a non-movable engagement member on the cutting tool, with the\nnon-moveable engagement member extending through at least a portion of an opening in the counter gear.  The non-moveable engagement member and opening in the counter gear permit relative movement between the counter gear and the non-moveable engagement\nmember when the predetermined number of incrementing steps have not occurred and restrict relative movement between the counter gear and the non-moveable engagement member when the predetermined number of incrementing steps have occurred.  A length of\nthe opening in the counter gear can at least partly determine the predetermined number of incrementing steps.\n In another embodiment, a method of determining an effective functional life of a medical cutting tool for cutting through bone is provided.  The method includes (a) cutting through bone in a bone preparation area using the cutting tool; (b)\nmeasuring a temperature of the bone in the bone preparation area; (c) cutting through bone in a different bone preparation area; and (d) measuring a temperature of the bone in the different bone preparation area.  Steps (a)-(d) can be repeated until the\ntemperature in a bone preparation area is measured to exceed 50.degree.  C. Then, the number of bone preparation areas that can be prepared using the cutting tool until the temperature in a respective bone preparation area exceeds 50.degree.  C. can be\ncalculated and the effective functional life of the cutting tool as the number calculated can be identified.\n The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.

The following description is exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the\nscope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in any way.  Various changes to the described embodiments may be made in the function and arrangement of the elements described herein without departing from the scope of the invention.\n As used in this application and in the claims, the terms "a," "an," and "the" include both the singular and plural forms of the element(s) they refer to unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.  Additionally, the term "includes" means\n"comprises." As used herein, the term "effective functional life" means the amount of use a tool can experience before it begins to operate suboptimally for its intended purpose.  In some embodiments, the effective functional life can be based on a\nnumber of uses of the tool and/or an amount of time the tool has been used.\n Although the operations of exemplary embodiments of the disclosed method may be described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation, it should be understood that disclosed embodiments can encompass an order of operations\nother than the particular, sequential order disclosed.  For example, operations described sequentially may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently.  Further, descriptions and disclosures provided in association with one particular\nembodiment are not limited to that embodiment, and may be applied to any embodiment disclosed.\n The technologies described herein can be used with a variety of instruments and tools to ensure that the quality of those instruments and tools are sufficient for the purpose to which they are intended to be used.  In some disclosed embodiments,\nthe instruments and tools described include medical cutting tools.  As described herein, the adoption of these technologies in connection with medical cutting tools can provide significant improvements over conventional methods and systems for assessing\nthe quality and appropriateness of such instruments and tools for use in surgical procedures.\n Conventional use of medical cutting tools generally involves one or more of the following steps.  The medical cutting tools are manufactured, purchased, and then delivered to the hospital.  Upon receipt by the hospital, the cutting tools undergo\nspecific sterilization processes to sterilize the cutting tools before they are introduced into the operating room environment for use on a patient.  After use on a patient, the cutting tools can be processed again through the same or similar procedures\nfor cleaning and sterilization.  After sterilization, the cutting tools can be used again on another patient.  This process can be repeated many times.\n Unfortunately, mere visual inspection of a cutting edge or surface of a tool by the surgeon or other related personnel is not an effective method of assessing the effectiveness of a cutting tool.  As a result, cutting tools are generally\ndiscarded only when the surgeon uses it in a clinical case and recognizes that the tool is no longer functioning properly.  With regard to medical cutting tools, the failure to function properly is generally recognized when the surgeon must apply\nexcessive loads to the tool to advance the cutter through the bone of the patient.  Such excessive loads generate additional heat at the cutting tool-bone interface, which can result in undesirable bone necrosis.\n Once the surgeon recognizes that the tool is no longer functioning properly, the tool is usually taken out of use.  Unfortunately, by the time the tool has been identified as no longer functioning properly, it has already been used past its\neffective functional life.  The recognition of the non-functioning of the tool by the surgeon generally occurs when the cutting tool experiences an extreme failure.  At this point, however, not only was the tool used past its effective functional life\nduring the surgery where the surgeon recognized the tool was not functioning properly, the cutting tool likely performed inefficiently or suboptimally for several surgeries prior to this event.  As a result, conventional methods of sterilization and\nreuse of cutting tools expose many patients to negative effects, such as bone heat necrosis, from the use of ineffective cutting tools.  The exposure of patients to ineffective cutting tools can negatively affect the success of the surgical procedure,\nboth by affecting the surgical process itself as well as the patient\'s recovery from the surgery.\n Accordingly, conventional approaches to sterilization and reuse do not provide sufficient protection to ensure that sub-optimal or otherwise inadequate cutting tools are not reused by surgeons.  The methods and systems described herein\nsignificantly improve the quality control for determining whether it is desirable to reuse a particular cutting tool after one or more previous uses.\n Exemplary Negative Effects of Using Dull Cutting Tools\n Dull cutting tools can cause clinical issues for patients on which these dull cutting tools are used.  The following embodiments relate to medical cutting tools; however, it should be understood that the systems and methods described herein can\nbe used with other cutting tools in which it would be desirable to limit or otherwise restrict their use when they become ineffective cutting tools.\n Medical cutting tools can be used to cut through bone, which can include both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Such cutting tools can include, for example, various reamers configured to cut and/or remove bone from a\npatient.  Efficient cutting tools are desirable to cut through bone, especially cortical bone which is generally denser and stronger than cancellous bone, without creating excessive heat.  Excessive heat can cause thermal damage to soft tissue and bone,\nincluding bone necrosis, with the amount of thermal damage caused being related to the magnitude of the temperature elevation and the period of time that the tissue is exposed to those temperatures.\n Necrosis of bone cells can occur when temperatures generated during cutting actions are at or above 122.degree.  F. (50.degree.  C.).  If the cutting procedure is to be followed by implantation of a prosthetic device into the bone preparation\narea, the occurrence of bone necrosis can reduce the effectiveness of the device.  Such prosthetic devices are desirably supported by strong bone and the occurrence of bone necrosis in the bone preparation area reduces the strength of the bone in that\narea.  This can result in a prosthetic device coming loose from the attachment area when the dead bone is resorbed and replaced by new bone during the healing process.\n High temperatures can also negatively affect bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) in the attachment area.  The attachment of uncemented orthopaedic devices to bone occurs when new bone grows into or onto the surface of the device.  However,\nbone-forming cells can die when exposed to temperatures over 50.degree.  C. Thus, the death of such bone cells at or near the surface of an attachment area can delay and interfere altogether with the attachment process.\n Heat generated when cutting bone is primarily due to friction at the cutting edge of the cutter (e.g., teeth) and the movement of bone chips over the surface of the cutter.  When a cutting tool is sharp, it can complete the preparation of the\nbone in fewer revolutions.  Since the cutting edges move less distance over the bone, the temperature in the bone preparation area remains lower.  In addition, fewer revolutions means that the bone is exposed to the elevated temperatures caused by the\ncutting action for a shorter period of time.  When the cutting edges are dull, however, several issues occur which quickly result in the generation of additional heat from friction.  First, the dull condition of cutting edges slows the advancement of the\ncutting tool and requires greater loads placed on the bone by the cutting tool, both of which contribute to elevating the temperature in the bone preparation area.  Second, the cutting tool takes longer to achieve the bone preparation resulting in a\ngreater number of revolutions of the cutting tool at higher applied loads yielding higher temperatures.  Because of the greater loads and increased time associated with using dull cutting tools, temperatures associated with their use in cutting bone can\nexceed the threshold of 122.degree.  F.\n A cutting tool (e.g., a reamer) that is always sharp is also safer, as less pressure is required when cutting (e.g., reaming).  Sharper cutting tools also allow the surgeon to exercise better control and more easily avoid both imprecise and\nover-cutting (e.g., over-reaming), which can result in improper positioning when the device is implanted, as well as removal of too much bone, compromising the stability of the device and the strength of the remaining bone that supports it.\n Effective Functional Life of Instruments\n A particular cutting tool can be evaluated to determine the effective functional life of that instrument.  After determining the effective functional life of a cutting tool, the systems and methods described herein can restrict the use of that\ntool outside of the tool\'s effective functional life.  By using the systems and methods described herein, a surgeon (or other operator) can be confident that the cutting tool that is to be used for a cutting process is sufficiently sharp, thereby\nreducing the occurrence of negative conditions associated with the use of dull instruments, such as bone necrosis when cutting bone.\n In some embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein provide a limited-use cutting tool to assure quality and function of the tool during a cutting procedure.  By using these systems and methods, a simplified quality assurance procedure\ncan be provided which does not require the hospital (or other entity) to implement a more complicated system for tracking and monitoring the condition of a particular cutting tool.\n The systems and methods described herein provide various manners of counting the number of uses of a cutting tool and disabling (or otherwise restricting) the use of that tool once the prescribed number of uses has been reached.  In some\nembodiments, the maximum number of uses can be predetermined by, for example, laboratory or field testing.  In one embodiment, the simulated clinical conditions can be worse-case scenario conditions.  Once the predetermined maximum number of uses has\nbeen reached, the cutting tool can be rendered non-functional and can be discarded or otherwise reconditioned.\nEXAMPLE\nDetermination of Effective Functional Life of Cutting Tools\n The following example relates to a cutting tool that is an acetabular spherical reamer.  The cutting teeth of an acetabular spherical reamer are preferably sharp in order to properly prepare the acetabular bed without generating excessive heat. \nIn many cases, a cutter can work for multiple surgeries; however, the hardness of the bone encountered by the cutter determines how long the cutter will function properly without damaging the patient\'s bone through heat necrosis.  As the cutter\nencounters hard cortical bone, the cutting edges begin to dull (e.g., teeth cutting edge radii increase) until the cutter will no longer efficiently cut the bone.  As the cutting teeth begin to dull, additional force is required to advance the cutter\nthrough the bone, thereby generating additional heat which can cause bone necrosis.\n FIG. 1 illustrates a laboratory test set-up for determining the effective functional life of a cutting tool.  In these tests, acetabular reamers were used to cut bone (i.e., cortical bovine bone) to determine the number of uses the acetabular\nreamers can experience before the end of their effective functional life.  In one example, it was determined that approximately six (6) uses of the reamer produces a complete preparation without generating excessive heat (e.g., temperatures at or above\n122.degree.  F. (50.degree.  C.)).\n FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate the results of an acetabular reamer evaluation in bovine bone.  FIG. 2 illustrates a chart showing the functional evaluation of a 50 mm acetabular reamer to cut bovine bone, graphing the number of bone preparations\n(i.e., uses of the cutting tool) and the temperature in the bone preparation area.  FIG. 3 illustrates a chart showing the functional evaluation of a 50 mm acetabular reamer to cut bovine bone, graphing the number of bone preparations (i.e., uses of the\ncutting tool) and the time required to achieve the bone preparation.  As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, continuing to use the cutter after the sixth use consistently resulted in a longer preparation time and increased heat generation.  The sharpness of the\nteeth cutting edges are directly proportional to the load required to advance the cutter, and therefore the resulting friction/heat generated.  As the cutting edge rounds (or dulls), it becomes less effective in penetrating the surface of the bone and\nrequires additional load to attempt to advance it.  This cutter wear is generally consistent for all cutting tools.\n Exemplary Limited-Use Cutting Tools\n In one embodiment, to ensure that an acetabular reamer functions properly during each use (e.g., without causing undue bone necrosis), a limiting device can be provided to limit the number of uses of the reamer.  For example, in one embodiment,\na limiting device can be provided to limit the number of uses of the reamer to six, which is the number of uses after which it has been determined that this acetabular reamer no longer functions in an optimal manner.  The number of uses can vary,\nhowever, and can, in some embodiments, be as low as one.  The number of uses can be predetermined based on field and/or laboratory testing and can be specific to the cutting device.  For example, one acetabular reamer can have an effective functional\nlife that permits six uses of the device to cut bone, while another different acetabular reamer may have an effective life of eight or more.\n The limiting device can be incorporated into the acetabular reamer to monitor the number of uses of the instrument by counting the number of times the reamer was assembled to the reamer shaft.  Once the prescribed number of uses is reached, the\nlimiting device can prevent the instrument from being assembled to the reamer shaft for further use.\n FIGS. 4A-4C and 5A-5B illustrate a reamer shaft 10 and an acetabular reamer 12 that are configured to be coupled together.  As shown in FIGS. 4A and 5A-5C, to attach the reamer 12 with the reamer shaft coupling member 14 of the reamer shaft 10,\na cross bar 16 of the reamer 12 is aligned with an opening 18 or other mating feature on the reamer shaft coupling member 14.  A collar 20 on the reamer shaft 10 can be retracted (FIG. 5A) and the reamer 12 can be inserted into the opening 18 on the\nreamer shaft 10 (FIG. 5B).  To lock the reamer in place, the reamer 12 can be rotated so that the cross bar 16 extends into a slotted portion 22 of the shaft coupling member 14 (e.g., clockwise in FIGS. 5B-5C).  Then the retracted collar 20 can be\nreleased, moving collar 20 towards the reamer 10 to secure it in place on reamer shaft 12 (FIG. 5C).\n FIG. 6A illustrates an embodiment of a limited-use acetabular reamer 112 that can be attached to a reamer shaft, such as that shown in FIGS. 5A-5C.  The limited-use reamer 112 comprises a limiting device that restricts the number of uses of the\nreamer.  In one embodiment, the limiting device can function by preventing the attachment of the reamer to a reamer shaft after a certain number of uses.\n The limiting device of the acetabular reamer can comprise a counting mechanism, such as a counter gear 130 shown in FIG. 6A.  As shown in FIG. 6, counter gear 130 can be configured to engage with an actuator or activation member 132 that is also\ncoupled to the reamer 112.  Actuator 132 can comprise any structure that is configured to engage with the reamer shaft coupling member 114 and cause relative movement in the counter mechanism (e.g., counter gear 130).  For example, as shown in FIGS.\n6A-6C and 7A-7C, actuator 132 can comprise a pin 134 that extends laterally from a side surface of its main body and a first gear surface 136 configured to mate with a second gear surface 138 of counter gear 132.\n When the reamer 112 is coupled to the reamer shaft, the actuator pin 134 is configured to engage with a surface on the reamer shaft (e.g., reamer coupling surface 140).  As the reamer 112 is rotated to lock the reamer 132 onto the end of the\nreamer shaft, contact between the actuator pin 134 and the surface 140 of the reamer shaft causes the actuator pin 134 to rotate, thereby causing the counter gear 130, which is engaged with the actuator 132, to also rotate.\n To restrict use of the reamer 112 to a predetermined number of uses, the counter gear 132 is restricted from rotating after that predetermined number of uses has occurred.  As shown in FIG. 6C, this can be achieved by providing a slotted portion\n142 on a bottom surface of the counter gear 130 that mates with a respective pin member 144 on the surface of the cross bar 116 of the reamer 112.  As the counter gear 130 continues to rotate after each use, the pin 144 will move along the slotted\nportion 142 of the counter gear 130.  After a certain number of rotations, however, the counter gear 130 will not be able to rotate any further because the pin 144 will reach the end of the slotted portion 142.\n FIG. 7B and FIG. 7C show the interaction of the coupling member 114 with the reamer 112.  As shown in FIG. 7C, reamer 112 can be rotated clockwise (in the direction of arrow 150, while actuator pin 134 rests against surface 140 of the coupling\nmember 114.  As reamer 112 rotates clockwise, the contact of actuator pin 134 with surface 140 causes actuator 132 to rotate relative to the actuator in the opposite direction (in the relative direction of arrow 152) and engage the counter gear 130.  A\ntorsion spring 146 can also be provided to cause the actuator 132 to return to the starting position when the reamer 112 is removed from the reamer shaft.  In this manner, when reamer 112 is removed from the shaft, actuator 132 returns to its starting\nposition, but counter gear 130 maintains its position.  That is, counter gear 130 moves in only one direction as a result of contact with actuator 132.  As counter gear 130 continues to rotate after each use, counter gear 130 will eventually encounter\nthe pin 144 on the cross bar 116.  When the pin 144 reaches the end of the slotted portion 142, activator 132 will not be able to rotate any further and reamer 112 will no longer be capable of being assembled on shaft coupling member 114.\n The number of times of use can be adjusted by changing the length of travel for each use and/or changing the length of permissible travel of the pin within the slotted portion (e.g., by lengthening or shortening the slotted portion).  In\naddition, the engaging surfaces of the counter gear and cross bar can be roughened to increase the friction between those two surfaces to achieve more effective contact between those two surfaces.  In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 6A-6C, the actuator is\nconfigured to rotate the counter gear about 36 degrees for each use; however, other amounts of travel per use can be achieved using actuator and counter gears as described herein.\n Although this embodiment provides a non-movable member on the cross bar and a slotted member on the counter gear, it should be understood that different configurations are possible, including, for example, providing a rigid member on the counter\ngear that engages with a non-movable slotted section or the like otherwise positioned on the cutting tool and/or reamer shaft.\n In some embodiments, the number of uses can be varied based on the size of the gearing and/or the length of the slotted portion.  For example, a longer slotted portion permits a greater number of uses, while a shorter slotted portion allows\nfewer uses.\n When the reamer is removed from the reamer shaft, the actuator can be configured to return to its original starting position.  To facilitate this movement of the actuator, a spring, such as a torsion spring, can be positioned in contact with the\nactuator.\n Preferably, the limiting device is built-in to the cutting tool so that the counting measures of the device cannot be easily circumvented.  For example, in the embodiment described in FIGS. 5 and 6, the limiting device is coupled to the reamer\nitself so that the limiting device is a part of the structure of the reamer.\n It should be understood that alternative limiting devices and systems can be used to restrict the number of times that an instrument can be attached to another tool.  For example, FIGS. 8-11 illustrate two other embodiments of instruments that\ncomprise limiting devices that are configured to prevent coupling of an instrument after a predetermined number of uses.\n FIGS. 8A-8C illustrate an embodiment of an instrument that includes a limiting device that has longitudinal counting mechanism, rather than a rotational counting mechanism, that is configured to restrict the number of times the instrument can be\ncoupled to a tool.  In the example shown in FIGS. 8A-8C, the instrument can be a reamer shaft and an acetabular reamer 212 similar to those shown in other embodiments.\n As shown in FIG. 8A, the limiting device can include a longitudinally moveable element 260 (e.g., a plunger) that is configured to engage with a surface of the tool to which the instrument is to be attached (e.g., reamer shaft).  Upon contact\nwith the surface of the tool, the longitudinally moveable element 260 can contact and move a longitudinal counter that is moveable through a limited distance to restrict the number of times the instrument has been attached to the tool.\n As shown in FIGS. 8A-8C, the longitudinal counter can be a longitudinally moveable counting rod 262 that can move a predetermined distance within the instrument.  Each time the longitudinally moveable element 260 contacts the counting rod 262,\nthe counting rod 262 moves a predetermined distance until it reaches the end of the amount of travel that is permitted by the instrument.  For example, counting rod can be configured so that it can move a predetermined distance within an opening in an\nend cap 263.  Once the counting rod has traveled the predetermined distance, an end of the counting rod engages with the end cap.  As a result of the engagement of the counting rod with the end cap, when the longitudinally moveable element 260 engages\nwith a surface on the tool, the counting rod cannot move any further within the opening in the end cap and further assembly of the instrument to the tool is prevented.\n FIG. 8A illustrates movement of longitudinally moveable element 260 in the direction of arrow 264 upon engagement of the longitudinally moveable element 260 with a reamer shaft.  As shown in FIG. 8B, the reamer is then rotated to lock it in\nplace (as described in other embodiments) and longitudinal counter 262 advances a prescribed distance.  As shown in FIG. 8C, upon removal of the reamer from the shaft, the longitudinally moveable element 260 returns to the start position (moving in the\ndirection of arrow 266) so that the cycle can repeat.  Once the longitudinally moveable element 260 reaches the end of the cap (or some other limiting structure), further assembly of the reamer to the shaft is no longer possible.\n The number of uses of the instrument can be set by determining the distance that the counting rod will travel during each engagement of the longitudinally moveable element with the surface of the tool, and setting the total distance that the\ncounting rod can travel within the instrument to be that distance times the number of uses of the instrument that are permissible before the instrument exceeds its effective functional life.\n Another alternative embodiment of an instrument with a limiting device is shown in FIG. 9.  In this embodiment, a combination of longitudinal movement and rotation movement can be used to count and restrict the number of uses of the instrument. \nAs shown in FIG. 9, a longitudinally moveable member 360 (e.g., a plunger) is configured to engage with a circular counter.  The circular counter can comprise, for example, an indexing wheel 363 that is rotatably attached to the instrument.  For each\nengagement of the instrument (e.g., an acetabular reamer) with a tool (e.g., a reamer shaft), the indexing wheel 363 can rotate by a predetermined amount.  In some embodiments, the predetermined amount of rotation for each use of the instrument (i.e.,\nfor each engagement of the instrument to a tool) can be a single tooth of the indexing wheel.  In other embodiments, the predetermined amount of rotation for each use of the instrument can be a rotation through a plurality of teeth on the indexing wheel.\n After a predetermined number of uses have been achieved (e.g., the number of uses that have been determined to be possible before exceeding the effective functional life of the instrument), a pin or other restricting member located on the\ninstrument can be configured to contact another structure to restrict further movement of the indexing wheel.  When the indexing wheel can no longer rotate, the instrument can no longer be coupled with the tool because the plunger cannot be depressed.\n Thus, relative movement of the indexing wheel and plunger can be restricted to prevent attachment of the instrument to a tool for further use of the instrument.  In the embodiment shown in FIG. 9, a pin 365 is fixed to the instrument (e.g.,\nreamer body) and a groove 367 in the indexing wheel permits a predetermined amount of rotational movement of the indexing wheel 363 relative to the pin 365.  However, it should be understood that the relative movement between the indexing wheel and the\ninstrument can be restricted in a variety of other ways.\n FIGS. 10A-10C illustrate the operation of the limiting use member of this embodiment.  FIG. 10A illustrates a force being applied by a shaft in contact with the reamer 312 in the direction of arrow 369.  As the longitudinally moveable element\n360 moves upward in response to the force, it engages with and causes indexing wheel 363 to rotate a predetermined amount.  As shown in FIG. 10B, when reamer 312 is removed from the shaft, longitudinally moveable element 360 moves downwards (in the\ndirection of arrow 371).  As the longitudinally moveable element 360 moves downward it does not engage with indexing wheel 363.  Then, FIG. 10C illustrates the indexing wheel 363 in a position where the reamer 312 can no longer be received on a shaft\nbecause pin 365 has reached the end of its travel along groove 367.\n In some embodiments, an indicator can be provided to reflect the number of remaining uses and/or to visually provide a user with an indication that the current use of the reamer is its last use within its effective functional life.\n FIGS. 11A and 11B illustrate an embodiment that provides a visual indication that the reamer has reached a predetermined number of uses that indicate it is at the end of its effective functional life.  FIGS. 11A and 11B show an embodiment where\nthe visual indicator (e.g., a red O-ring) moves from a position inside the device to a position outside the device where it is visible.  In this embodiment, an O-ring 470 can be provided inside the drive shaft 472 of a reamer.  Once the device reaches\nits last use and is removed from the reamer shaft, an inner spring 474 pushes the longitudinally moveable element 460 and the O-ring 470 out of the end of the device providing a visual indication that the reamer cannot be used again.\n It should be understood that the systems and methods described herein can be applied to a variety of cutting tools with different couplings.  Thus, as discussed herein, different cutting tools can be provided with limiting devices that can limit\nthe use of the cutting tool to a predetermined number of uses, based on a determined effective functional life of that device for its intended function.  By using the systems and methods described herein, various cutting tools can be provided with\nbuilt-in limiting devices to provide quality control procedures that are tied to the number of uses of the tools and not on visual inspection or other efforts by surgeons or other related personnel.\n Thus, the embodiments described herein advantageously register (by counters or other similar mechanisms) the number of uses of an instrument such as a cutting tool by tracking or monitoring the number of times the instrument has been coupled to\nanother member (e.g., a drive shaft).  Because an instrument may be sterilized many times before use, the registering of "uses" instead of "sterilizations" can be advantageous.  For example, for any surgical procedure numerous sterilized instruments may\nbe packaged together for the surgeon, such as various size reamers in a single sterilized tray.  However, generally not all of these sterilized instruments are assembled with a tool (e.g., a drive shaft) and used by the surgeon.  Thus, by registering the\nnumber of times of assembly, the effective functional life of the instrument can be accurately tracked.\n In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and should not be taken as limiting\nthe scope of the invention.  Rather, the scope of the invention is defined by the following claims.  We therefore claim as our invention all that comes within the scope and spirit of these claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

 'patent_description': u'FIELD\n The present disclosure concerns embodiments of a femoral hip implant and methods for implanting femoral hip implants.\nBACKGROUND\n In total hip replacement, there are several designs which address different indications for hip replacement depending on the quality and geometry of the patient\'s bones.  Hip implants generally replace the femoral head and the acetabular socket\nwith the objectives of restoring stable pain-free motion.  There are several different designs of femoral components.  In some designs, just the surface of the femoral head is replaced, while other designs are composed of a stem and head-neck section.\n With resurfacing designed femoral components, minimal bone is removed; however complications with implant loosening can occur due to the ability of the bone to support the implant.  With the stemmed femoral components, the implant is fixed\nwithin the canal of the femur.  The effectiveness of this design is dependent, at least in part, on the strength of the cancellous bone within the canal of the femur.  Without proper strength, the stem can subside (sink) further into the canal creating\ninstability and, in some cases, fractures.  Both scenarios can result in undesirable revision surgery.\nSUMMARY\n In one embodiment, a bone implant apparatus is provided.  The apparatus includes a proximal end portion, a central tapered body with a distal end portion, and a circumferential collar positioned between the proximal end portion and the distal\nend portion of the central tapered body.  The circumferential collar comprises a porous material capable of allowing bone ingrowth into the collar.  A distally-extending portion extending from the collar toward the distal end portion can also be formed\nof a porous material capable of allowing bone ingrowth into the distally-extending portion.  The central tapered body can tapers from the distally-extending portion to the distal end portion.\n In some implementations, the proximal end portion can be integral with the distal end portion forming a main shaft, and the collar is secured to the main shaft between the proximal and distal end portions.  The distally-extending portion can be\na porous body disposed circumferentially around the main shaft distal to the circumferential collar.  The circumferential collar further can include a substantially spherical distal surface.  The distal end portion of the apparatus can be substantially\nsmooth and formed of a material that restricts bone ingrowth.  In some implementations, the proximal end portion can be tapered, with the proximal end portion being at its widest in the vicinity of the collar and at its narrowest furthest from the\ncollar.\n In some embodiments, the bone implant apparatus is configured to be implanted without using any cement or other bonding agents to bond the implant to the bone of the femur.  The bone implant apparatus can also be sized to be sufficiently long so\nthat at least a portion of the distal end portion extends through a lateral cortex of a femur of a subject when implanted therein.\n In another embodiment, a method for total hip replacement is provided.  The method can include inserting a pin into a neck of a femur and through a lateral cortex of the femur to create an opening in the femur and provide a guide for a\ncannulated cutter, forming an enlarged opening in the femur by passing the cannulated cutter over the pin, and inserting an implant into the enlarged opening created by the cannulated cutter.  The cannulated cutter can include a distal cylindrical\ncutting portion, a tapered central cutting portion, and a proximal spherical cutting portion.\n During implantation, the pin can be oriented at substantially the same angle as the true neck of the femur.  The implant can have a proximal end portion, a distal end portion, and a circumferential collar positioned therebetween.  The\ncircumferential collar can have a substantially spherical distal surface and as the cannulated cutter passes over the pin to enlarge the opening in the femur, the proximal spherical cutting portion can form a surface in the femur that is sized to receive\nthe spherical distal surface of the collar.  The circumferential collar can comprise a porous material capable of allowing bone ingrowth into the collar when the implant is received in the enlarged opening.\n In some implementations, the inserting of the implant into the enlarged opening can include press-fitting the implant into the enlarged opening.  The implant can compress the cancellous bone to provide fixation.  In other implementations, the\nforming of the enlarged opening can include passing the distal cylindrical cutting portion through a lateral cortex of the femur, and the inserting of the implant into the enlarged opening can include causing a distal end portion of the implant to extend\nout of the lateral cortex of the femur.  The distal end portion of the implant can at least partially contact the cortical bone of the lateral cortex to help provide stability of the implant.  In some implementations, both ends of the implant can be\nsupported by cortical bone, with a distal end of the implant contacting cortical bone in the vicinity of the lateral cortex and a proximal end of the implant contacting cortical bone in the neck of the femur.\n The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.

The disclosed methods, apparatuses, and systems should not be construed as limiting in any way. \nInstead, the present disclosure is directed toward all novel and nonobvious features and aspects of the various disclosed embodiments, alone and in various combinations and sub-combinations with one another.  The methods, apparatus, and systems are not\nlimited to any specific aspect or feature or combination thereof, nor do the disclosed embodiments require that any one or more specific advantages be present or problems be solved.\n Although the operations of some of the disclosed methods are described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation, it should be understood that this manner of description encompasses rearrangement, unless a particular ordering\nis required by specific language set forth below.  For example, operations described sequentially may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently.  Moreover, for the sake of simplicity, the attached figures may not show the various ways in\nwhich the disclosed methods can be used in conjunction with other methods.  Additionally, the description sometimes uses terms like "provide" or "achieve" to describe the disclosed methods.  These terms are high-level abstractions of the actual\noperations that are performed.  The actual operations that correspond to these terms may vary depending on the particular implementation and are readily discernible by one of ordinary skill in the art.\n As used in this application and in the claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include the plural forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.  Additionally, the term "includes" means "comprises." Further, the terms "coupled" and\n"associated" generally mean electrically, electromagnetically, and/or physically (e.g., mechanically or chemically) coupled or linked and does not exclude the presence of intermediate elements between the coupled or associated items absent specific\ncontrary language.\n As used herein, the term "porous" means a structure having one or more openings, gaps, or other such surfaces that allow bone to grow into the structure and mechanically interlock with the structure.  "Bone ingrowth" refers to the growing of\nbone into a porous structure in a manner that allows the bone to interlock with the structure.  "Bone ongrowth" refers to the growing of bone on a surface of a structure in a manner so that the bone growth contacts the structure without generally\ninterlocking with that structure.\n The femoral hip implants and methods of use disclosed herein provide improved femoral implant fixation.  In particular, instead of relying solely on softer cancellous bone, the femoral hip implants disclosed herein can interact with harder\ncortical bone to provide improved stability.  In addition, at least in some embodiments, the disclosed femoral hip implants provide a bone conserving approach, reducing the amount of bone that is removed and the occurrence of complications common with\nconventional hip implants.\n FIGS. 1A-1C depict an embodiment of a femoral hip implant 10.  Femoral hip implant 10 comprises a proximal end 12, a centrally tapered body 14 with a distal end 16, and a circumferential collar 18 positioned between proximal end 12 and centrally\ntapered body 14.  Proximal end 12, centrally tapered body 14, and collar 18 can be integrally formed as a single structure.\n Collar 18 can comprise a substantially spherical distal surface 20.  The spherical surface of the collar can provide improved stress distribution.  With a flat collar, when the implant is loaded, the contact quickly becomes highly focused around\na small point leading to high stresses.  The spherical collar provides for better stress distribution through a larger area contact at loading.\n Collar 18 can comprise a generally porous material to allow for bone ingrowth into collar 18.  As shown in FIGS. 1A-1C, collar 18 can have a distally-extending portion 22 of porous material.  Distally-extending portion 22 preferably tapers in\nthe same manner as tapered body 14, forming one generally contiguous tapered shape.  As noted above, implant 10 can be formed as a single integral structure.  However, if desired, portions of the implant can be formed separate from the main body of the\nimplant and coupled together.  For example, distally-extending portion 22 can be formed as part of a collar that can be separately attached to the implant.\n FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate femoral hip implant 10 fixed within a femur of a subject.  As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, when implanted into a subject, distal end 16 of femoral hip implant 10 extends out the lateral cortex 24 of the femur 26, while\nproximal end 12 of femoral hip implant 10 extends out of the neck 28 of the femur 26.  Thus, collar 18 provides proximal support for the implant utilizing the cortical bone of the femoral neck 28, and spherical distal surface 20 of the circumferential\ncollar 18 provides for stress distribution across a large area, reducing the formation of stress concentrations in bone that is in the vicinity of collar 18.  Since both ends (i.e., distal end 16 and proximal end 12) of the femoral hip implant utilize\ncortical bone as primary support and cancellous bone as secondary support, femoral hip implant 10 can achieve greater stability over conventional designs that rely primarily on cancellous bone for support of an implant.\n As noted above, collar 18 can be made from a substantially porous material to allow bone ingrowth for long-term stability of the implant.  Additionally, distally-extending portion 22 can also be made of porous material to promote stability of\nthe implant by allowing for bone ingrowth along at least a portion of femoral hip implant 10 deeper into the neck 28 of the femur 26.  Distal end 16 can be smooth or polished to inhibit bone fixation, allowing the implant to transfer stress to the\nfemoral neck 28 through the circumferential collar 18 while providing end support on the cortical bone of the lateral cortex 24.  In addition, by having a portion that inhibits bone ingrowth, the effects of stress shielding can be reduced.  Devices which\nare too stiff or allow for bone attachment throughout their length can cause stress shielding, which can result in bone resorption and loosening of the implant.\n Femoral hip implant 10 can achieve both short-term and long-term stability.  For example, immediate stability (i.e., 6-8 weeks post-operatively) is achieved by at least the following features: (1) the spherical collar providing proximal support\nthrough the cortical bone of the femoral neck; (2) the distal polished tip providing support as it extends through the lateral cortex of the femur; and (3) the use of the central tapered body as a secondary fixation feature, instead of a primary fixation\nfeature.  Although the central tapered body exerts some compressive force on the cancellous bone within the neck of the femur, the forces on the cancellous bone are significantly reduced compared to conventional devices.\n Long-term stability can be achieved by the same features as noted above for immediate stability, along with additional features provided by bone ingrowth into the implant and stress transfer to the proximal neck area.  For example, at least some\nadditional features that enhance long-term stability include (1) the fully porous collar that helps to stress the proximal femoral bone and provide ingrowth; (2) the porous distally-extending portion below the collar that provides for additional bone\ningrowth; and (3) the smooth, polished distal tip which passes through the lateral cortex providing end support to the implant and transferring stress to the femoral neck through the collar.\n Accordingly, the femoral hip implant described herein allows for greater stability by providing specific bone ingrowth areas at or near the femoral neck 28 to allow for bone fixation, while also providing non-ingrowth areas such that stress is\ntransmitted through the implant to the bone at the bone ingrowth areas, as shown in FIG. 3.\n FIGS. 4-6C illustrate an approach for preparing bone for receiving an implant, such as femoral hip implant 10.  Conventional femoral implant designs generally require multiple instruments to prepare bone for receiving an implant, which can lead\nto inaccuracies as each sequential step can accumulate errors and jeopardize the fit of the implant.  To reduce these errors, the following method for preparing bone utilizes a biomechanical axial datum a single preparation (i.e., cutting) tool.  This\napproach can provide very precise implant dimensions, allowing for highly repeatable and accurate press-fitting of implants within the bone.\n A femoral hip implant (e.g., femoral hip implant 10) is preferably oriented generally parallel to the true neck of the femur.  This orientation can be facilitated by using a pin 30 driven through the femoral neck 28 of the femur 26, and then out\nthe lateral cortex 24, as shown in FIG. 4.  The pin 30 can be oriented along the axis of the femoral neck, creating an angle 32 with the longitudinal axis of the femur 34.  The pin 30 can then be used as a datum to guide a cannulated compound cutter 36\n(FIG. 5A), which preferably prepares the femur in one step for the implant.  The cutter can be driven by hand or power, and can be composed of three distinct cutting geometries: a spherical proximal cutter 38, a tapered central cutter 40 (tapered towards\nthe distal end), and a cylindrical distal cutter 42, as shown in the enlarged view of cutter 36 in FIG. 5B.\n As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, after insertion the pin 30 into the femur 26, cutter 36 can be slipped over pin 30 and advanced into the bone through the femoral neck 28 and out the lateral cortex 24, thereby creating an opening or hole.  The\nopening generally approximates the shape of the outer surfaces of the implant; however, the opening is preferably a smaller than the size required by the implant to achieve a tight fit of the implant into the opening.  The femoral hip implant 10 can then\nbe press-fitted into the opening, as shown in FIG. 6C.  If a greater interference fit is desired, less bone can be removed by cutter 36.  For example, in one embodiment, a separate spherical cutter can be used to remove bone at the neck area only,\ngreatly increasing the press fit of the implant.\n In some embodiments, the femoral hip implants described herein can be implanted without using any cement to achieve temporary or permanent stability.  For example, the above-described embodiments provide implants that can be press-fitted into\nbone, with the implant configured to allow bone to grow into the implant through one or more porous portions and attach to the implant.  Thus, the implants described herein and the methods of use can, in some embodiments, be secured using press-fitting\ntechniques and can be cement-free implants.\n FIGS. 7-9 illustrate embodiments with a head 50 inserted onto proximal end 12 of femoral hip implant 10.  Head 50 is inserted into a cup implant 52, which is inserted into the acetabulum (pelvic bone) of a subject.  The femoral hip implant 10\ncan be used with a variety of head and cup systems in the manner shown in FIGS. 7-9.  Cup implants and heads can vary in size to accommodate the particular geometry of the subject.  For example, cup implants, in some embodiments, can be provided in sizes\nthat vary from 20-34 mm in size and the heads, in some embodiments, can be provided in sizes from 12 mm to 26 mm.  Of course, other sizes are envisioned and can be desirable if the geometry of the subject requires larger or smaller cup implants and\nheads.\n FIGS. 10-12 illustrate another embodiment of a femoral hip implant 110.  Femoral hip implant 110 is similar to femoral hip implant 10; however, femoral hip implant 110 is configured to allow bone ongrowth--instead of ingrowth--on one or more\nareas of the implant.  Femoral hip implant 110 comprises a proximal end 112, a centrally tapered body 114 with a distal end 116, and a circumferential collar 118 between proximal end 112 and centrally tapered body 114.  Collar 118 can comprise a\nsubstantially spherical distal surface 120.  As discussed above, the spherical surface of the collar can provide improved stress distribution.\n Spherical distal surface 120 can be textured to encourage bone ongrowth.  FIGS. 10-12 illustrate an embodiment in which the surface 120 is macro-textured.  In some embodiments, this texture can comprise a plurality of indentations that are sized\nto allow growth of bone into the indentations or dimples to restrict movement of implant 110 after implantation.  In some embodiments, centrally tapered body 114 can also have a portion that allows bone on growth.  Thus, for example, centrally tapered\nbody 114 can also have a plurality indentations, such as the grooves indicated in FIG. 11, that allow for bone ongrowth.  Proximal and distal ends 112, 116 can comprise solid surfaces, such as a smooth polished surface.  These surfaces preferably\nrestrict bone ingrowth or ongrowth.\n To further promote bone growth (i.e., ongrowth or ingrowth) where desired, portions of the implants described herein can be coated with hydroxyapatite (HA) or other coatings that can increase or facilitate bone growth on the implant.\n The implants described herein can be formed of various biocompatible materials.  In some embodiments, the implants can be formed of titanium alloys, such as ASTM F-136 (Ti6A14V ELI Titanium Alloy).  In other embodiments, the implants can be\nformed using other biocompatible materials, such as cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and various composite materials or plastics.\n The porous portions of the implant described herein can be formed in various ways.  For example, in one embodiment, the implant can be formed using additive manufacturing techniques.  Additive manufacturing techniques can include electron beam\nmelting (EEM) whereby the implant can be produced by building the implant layer-by-layer from metal powder (e.g., a titanium alloy powder) using a powerful electron beam.  Another additive manufacturing technique that can be used to produce the implants\ndescribed herein is laser-sintering, such as that provided by EOS GmbH in Munich, Germany.  These techniques can be used to produce an implant with the desired porous portions (for bone ingrowth) or indentations (for bone ongrowth), as well as the other\nportions of the implant which are intended to restrict bone in-growth and on-growth.\n The implants described herein can also be produced using other more conventional techniques, including, for example, conventional machining processes.  In some embodiments, for example, the porous portions of the implant can be created by\nlayering a plurality of beads (or other elements) on top of one another to create a plurality of layers of beads.  The beads can be fused to one another and to the implant body to form gaps into which bone can grow.\n In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and should not be taken as limiting\nthe scope of the invention.  Rather, the scope of the invention is defined by the following claims.  We therefore claim as our invention all that comes within the scope and spirit of these claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

 'patent_description': u'FIELD\n This disclosure relates to a novel systems and method relating to cutting tools.\nBACKGROUND\n Cutting tools, such as medical reamers used by surgeons, generally have a cutting surface that is able to cut and/or remove material from an object.  For example, in many different disciplines in orthopedics cutting tools are used for machining\nbone in the preparation of artificial joints including hips, knees, elbows and shoulders, and also in the repair of long bone fractures.  The design and method of manufacturing cutting surfaces of cutting tools can affect the efficiency, functional life\nof the spherical reamer and cost in manufacturing.  Accordingly, improvements relating to design and manufacturing methods are desirable.\nSUMMARY\n In some embodiments, improved cutting tools and methods of manufacturing the same are provided.\n In certain implementations, the cutting tools comprise medical reamers, including acetabular reamers, long bone cylindrical reamers, long bone tapered reamers, patella reamers and glenoid reamers along with the design of different cutting teeth\nin specific zones of the reamers and the improved method of making these reamers and their cutting edges.\n In some implementations, a cutting tool is provided with a cutting surface on a first side of the cutting tool and an attachment member on a second side of the cutting tool.  The cutting surface can include a plurality of cutting edges and the\nattachment member can be configured to be coupled to a powered driving member (e.g., a drill).  The cutting tool comprises an axis of rotation and the cutting surface defines a plurality of latitude lines.  The plurality of cutting edges can be oriented\nat varying orientation angles relative to the latitude lines.\n In some implementations, the plurality of cutting edges can be in three different zones and respective cutting edges in the different zones have different characteristics.  The different zones can comprise a polar zone, a transition zone, and an\nequatorial zone.  Respective cutting edges can define a cutting angle between the cutting edge and a first side of the cutting tool, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the polar zone can be larger than those defined by cutting edges in the\ntransition zone, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the transition zone can be larger than those defined by cutting edges in the equatorial zone.  In some implementations, the tooth height can be the same (i.e., substantially the same)\nregardless of the cutting angle.\n In some implementations, the orientation angles vary depending on whether the respective cutting edges are in the polar zone, the transition zone, or the equatorial zone, and the orientation angle of respective cutting edges in the equatorial\nzone is greater than the orientation angle of respective cutting edges in the transition zone, and the orientation angle of respective cutting edges in the transition zone is greater than the orientation angle of respective cutting edges in the polar\nzone.\n In some implementations, the thickness of the side wall is less than 0.040 inches, or in some cases, between 0.022 inches and 0.40 inches.  Openings can be provided adjacent respective cutting edges, the respective openings defining a funnel\nangle that is between 20 and 40 degrees.  In some cases, the funnel angle can be between 25 and 35 degrees.\n In some implementations, the cutting surface is a panel and the cutting tool comprises a plurality of separate panels.  The cutting tool can include a frame member (e.g., a center support and a base) and the plurality of separate panels can be\ncoupled to the frame member.\n In another implementation, a method for forming a cutting tool is provided.  The method can include forming a plurality of panels from one or more flat sheets of metal and coupling the plurality of panels to a frame member to form the cutting\ntool.  The plurality of panels can be formed with a plurality of cutting edges and a plurality of openings adjacent respective cutting edges.  When coupled to the frame member, the plurality of panels can define a plurality of latitude lines about the\naxis of rotation of the cutting tool and the plurality of formed cutting edges have orientation angles relative to the latitude lines that vary.  In some cases, respective panels can have cutting edges with orientation angles that vary along the\nrespective panel.\n In certain implementations, the act of forming a plurality of panels comprises stamping the one or more flat sheets of metal to form a plurality of cavities and punching holes at or adjacent to the plurality of cavity to provide\nbone-chip-receiving openings.  The act of forming the plurality of cavities can include forming a plurality of "V"-shaped cavities.\n In certain implementations, the act of forming the plurality of panels can include stamping the one or more panels to create a desired height of the cutting edges and to provide a desired curvature of the one or more panels.\n In certain implementations, the act of coupling the plurality of panels to the frame member can include forming a frame member that comprises a center support, a base, and a form dome, and securing the plurality of panels to the center support,\nthe base, and the form dome.  In some cases, the act of securing the plurality of panels to the center support, the base, and the form dome can be performed by laser welding or other types of welding.  The act of coupling the plurality of panels to the\nframe member can also include placing the plurality of panels into an injection molding tool and injection molding the frame member around the plurality of panels to create the frame member.\n In some implementations, the act of forming a plurality of panels from one or more flat sheets of metal can include forming the plurality of cutting edges with different zones that have cutting edges with different characteristics, the different\nzones comprising a polar zone, a transition zone, and an equatorial zone.  Respective cutting edges can define a cutting angle between the cutting edge and a first side of the cutting tool, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the polar zone\nare larger than those defined by cutting edges in the transition zone, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the transition zone are larger than those defined by cutting edges in the equatorial zone.\n In certain implementations, the act of punching holes at or adjacent to the plurality of cavity comprises forming bone-chip-receiving openings with a funnel angle that is between 20 and 40 degrees.  In addition, in some cases, the one or more\nflat sheets of metal have a thickness less than 0.040 inches.\n In certain implementations, the method includes determining an effective functional life of the cutting tool.\n In other embodiments, a cutting tool is provide that has a cutting surface on a first side of the cutting tool, the cutting surface comprising a plurality of cutting edges, and an attachment member on a second side of the cutting tool, the\nattachment member being configured to be coupled to a powered driving member.  A plurality of cutting edges are provided in at least three different zones and respective cutting edges in the different zones have different characteristics.\n The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.

Various changes to the described embodiments may be made in the function and arrangement of\nthe elements described herein without departing from the scope of the invention.\n As used in this application and in the claims, the terms "a," "an," and "the" include both the singular and plural forms of the element(s) they refer to unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.  Additionally, the term "includes" means\n"comprises." Further, the term "coupled" generally means electrically, electromagnetically, and/or physically (e.g., mechanically or chemically) coupled or linked and does not exclude the presence of intermediate elements between the coupled or\nassociated items absent specific contrary language.\n As used herein, the term "effective functional life" means the amount of use a tool can experience before it begins to operate suboptimally for its intended purpose.  In some embodiments, the effective functional life can be based on a number of\nuses of the tool and/or an amount of time the tool has been used.  As used herein, the term "single-use" tool or instrument means a tool or instrument that is configured and/or intended to be used once before being discarded.  Thus, a single-use tool or\ninstrument is a non-reusable device in contrast to reusable tools or instruments which, subject to certain procedures such as cleaning and sterilization, may be used more than once.  As used herein, the term "powered driving member" means any device\ncapable of driving a cutting tool such as, for example, a drill.\n Although the operations of exemplary embodiments of the disclosed method may be described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation, it should be understood that disclosed embodiments can encompass an order of operations\nother than the particular, sequential order disclosed.  For example, operations described sequentially may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently.  Further, descriptions and disclosures provided in association with one particular\nembodiment are not limited to that embodiment, and may be applied to any embodiment disclosed.\n It is generally desirable that cutting surfaces on a cutting tool (e.g., cutting teeth) be as accurate and consistent as possible for the dimensional accuracy of the final preparation in the bone.  For example, cementless acetabular implants\n(press fit) are dependent on their dimension and the dimension of the bone preparation to create a reproducible interference fit for establishing initial stability of the implant.  FIG. 1 illustrates an acetabular reamer, the use of the reamer to prepare\nthe acetabulum, and a press-fit acetabular implant positioned as part of a total hip procedure.\n The initial stability of the implant is critical to long term success and if the implant moves large amounts (e.g., 75 microns or more) under physiological loads post-operatively, it can result in soft tissue growing into the implant rather than\nbone.  If this occurs, the implant will eventually loosen.  Accordingly, the accuracy of the initial fit must provide stability of the implant to allow bone to grow into the implant during the first 6-12 weeks after surgery.  In some instances, the\ninterference level required for cementless acetabular implants can be required to be very small (e.g., less than 2 mm, and, in some cases, preferably less than 1 mm).  However, commercial cutters can vary in their accuracy by as much as 0.25 mm and these\nvariations can result in initial acetabular implant stability.  Because the initial interference fit provides stability to the implant, improved accuracy of the teeth height and performance can assist in achieving this goal.\n Configuration of Cutting Members\n Conventional reamer designs use the same cutting tooth geometry within each design.  These teeth are also positioned at 90.degree.  to the latitude lines of the spherical reamer surface.  However, cutting teeth around the equator of the reamer\nperform a side cutting function while teeth towards the dome of the cutter perform an end cutting function.\n As described in more detail herein, various embodiments are provided in which reamers utilize different cutting teeth configurations and different orientations to address the different bone cutting requirements and thereby improving the\nefficiency of the cut.  By efficiently designing cutting teeth for specific operations, faster bone cuts can be achieved, thereby producing less friction.  Minimizing the friction generated by the reamers relates directly to maintaining the life of the\nbone.  Friction can lead to heat and if the cutter-bone interface reaches temperatures above 50.degree.  C. (122.degree.  F.) bone death (necrosis) can occur.  This can affect long term success of the procedure whether the implant is used with or without\nbone cement.  If the bone preparation bed is damaged due to excessive heat generated from the acetabular cutter, the fixation of the implant will be compromised and can lead to loosening and revision.\n There are two primary forces applied to the reamer during the machining of the bone.  When considering an acetabular reamer, as shown in FIG. 2, there is an axial force applied by the surgeon who pushes the cutter into the acetabulum and a\nsecond torsional force exerted by the power reaming tool.  In some embodiments, the novel cutting tools disclosed herein convert the torsional force into a force applied at the cutting tooth edge to improve the efficiency of the cut.\n The systems and methods described herein for forming cutting tools can provide greater control and accuracy of the tooth sharpness, cutting angles, and resulting bone chip removal by the tool.  In addition, as described in more detail below, the\ncutting tools described herein can be formed by novel manufacturing processes that permit the creation of multiple teeth in one operation.\n In the embodiments described herein, cutting surfaces (e.g., teeth) can comprise a sharp tooth edge (tolerance 0.0005\'\' to 0.002\'\' tooth edge radius), a specific tooth elevation (tolerance 0.002\'\'-0.004\'\'), specific cutting angle, a specific\ntooth orientation to the axis of rotation (e.g., tool angle), and a peripheral opening around the cutting edge providing a designed flow path for the bone debris as shown in FIG. 3.  This tooth geometry can also be manufactured according to FIG. 4\nthrough a series of stamping operations allowing for multiple teeth to be made at the same time.  For example, as illustrated in FIG. 4, a flat sheet of material (e.g., metal) can be stamped so that a plurality of "V"-type cavities are punched into the\nsheet based on a desired cutting angle .omega..  Next, a plurality of holes can be punched around the "V"-type cavities (or grooves), creating a cutting edge.  If necessary, another stamping step can be performed to stamp the tooth height and curvature\nin operation (or multiple operations if desired).  As shown in FIG. 4, angle .beta.  determines the tooth height and angle .beta.  in conjunction with angle .alpha.  will determine the rake angle .omega.  (.omega.=.alpha.-.beta.) of the cutting surface. \nIn some embodiments, the rake angle can vary between about 5 and 25 degrees, and in other embodiments between about 5 and 15 degrees (e.g., about 10 degrees)\n Thus, in contrast to conventional devices, the tooth angle (.alpha.) can be established in the first forming operation and can be set (.omega.  and .beta.  angles) based on the intended function.  Multiple iterations of this tooth design can be\nprovided in specific zones of the reamer surface which address the intended type of cutting required at those locations.\n In some embodiments, the novel cutting tools disclosed herein can have teeth arranged in a spiral or helix manner on the surface of the cutter.  However, the tooth designs and tooth orientations can be optimized to reduce the reaming time\nrequired to complete the preparation.  As shown in FIGS. 5-8, the cutting edges of the teeth can be oriented at different angles to the lines of latitude based on the required cutting functions at various positions on the surface of the reamer.  This can\nprovide for a faster cut by converting the rotational energy into linear energy assisting in advancing the reamer into the preparation analogous to a screw thread (FIG. 5).  The tooth orientation can further improve the cutting force at the tooth edge. \nBy changing the orientation of the cutting edge relative to the latitude lines, a portion of the torsional force is converted into a cutting force at the tooth edge as shown in FIG. 6.  This improvement primarily benefits the teeth closest to the equator\nas they are performing a side cutting function.\n As shown in FIGS. 5-6, the angle of orientation of the cutting edge relative to axis of rotation can increase from the equatorial teeth to the polar teeth and decrease relative to the latitude lines.  At least three different types of cutting\nteeth (e.g., orientation angles and/or cutting angles varying) can be provided on the tool.  In some embodiments, at least three regions are provided with similar type teeth in each region.  In other embodiments, the teeth can vary in a transitional\nmanner effectively providing more than three zones.\n In some embodiments, relative to the latitude lines, the range of variation can be orientation angles of between 10 and 30 degrees (more preferably between 15 and 25 degrees--e.g., 20 degrees) for the equatorial zone, orientation angles of less\nthan 5 degrees (more preferably about 0 degrees) in the polar zone, and somewhere in between for the orientation angles in the transition zone (e.g., between 0 and 20 degrees, or preferably between 5 and 15 degrees--e.g., 10 degrees).  A benefit of the\nlarger orientation angles in the equatorial zone is a portion of the axial load applied by the operator will be converted into driving the cutting edge into the bone.  As you move to the polar zone, the angle of the tooth on the surface has less effect\nas the tooth becomes perpendicular to the direction of the cut.  That is, the specific tooth geometry in the polar zone needs to address an end cutting ability rather than a side cutting ability.\n FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary process by which a cutting tool (e.g., a spherical reamer) transitions from engagement with the bone at one area to another area of the cutting tool.  As used herein, the term "polar teeth" refer to cutting\nsurfaces at and/or adjacent the pole of the spherical reamer, the term "equatorial teeth" refer to cutting surfaces at and/or adjacent to the equator of reamers having a hemispherical shape (e.g., the area furthest from the poles in FIG. 7), and the term\n"transition teeth" refer to cutting surfaces between the polar and equatorial teeth.\n In the exemplary reaming process illustrated in FIG. 7, the spherical reamer begins by introduction into the concave surface of the acetabulum.  It is noted that this initiation of the cut involves just the equatorial teeth.  These equatorial\nteeth are performing more of a side cutting function and therefore can have a specific tooth angle based on this intended function.  Additional teeth (i.e., the transitional teeth) become engaged with the bone as the reamer is further introduced into the\nacetabulum.  The transitional teeth perform a combination of side-cutting and end-cutting and can be optimized for this purpose.  As the reamer becomes fully inserted into the preparation site, the teeth at the pole (i.e., the polar teeth) of the reamer\nserve to primarily end-cut.\n Thus, the teeth can have different cutting demands depending on their location on the surface of the reamer and can be configured accordingly.  FIG. 8 illustrates the manner in which the cutting angles of the teeth can vary in accordance with\nthe required cutting function of the bone.  The table below illustrates the types of teeth and their configurations as reflected in FIG. 8.\n TABLE-US-00001 Cutting angle (defined relative to a side surface Tooth edge Teeth Region of the cutting tool) radius Funnel angle Tooth height Equatorial 15-35 degrees 0.0005-0.002\'\' 20-40 degrees, 0.020 .+-.  0.002\'\' (more preferably, (more\npreferably, 20-30 degrees) 25-35 degrees) Transition 35-55 degrees 0.0005-0.002\'\' 20-40 degrees, 0.020 .+-.  0.002\'\' (more preferably, (more preferably, 40-50 degrees) 25-35 degrees) Polar 55-75 degrees 0.0005-0.002\'\' 20-40 degrees, 0.020 .+-.  0.002\'\'\n(more preferably, (more preferably, 60-70 degrees) 25-35 degrees)\n Although, FIG. 8 illustrates these three zones as distinct zones, it should be understood that the cutting surfaces can transition gradually from one zone to another.  Thus, polar teeth can transition gradually from polar teeth with the\norientation and characteristics noted above to transition teeth with the orientation and characteristics noted above.  In this manner, for example, some teeth can have orientation and characteristics of polar teeth (e.g., 65 degree cutting angle), some\ncan have characteristics of transition teeth (e.g., 45 degree cutting angle), and some teeth between the polar teeth and transition teeth can have characteristics somewhere inbetween (e.g., 55 degree cutting angle).\n Proper bone chip exit paths can also contribute to an improved surgical preparation.  With a non-impeded path for the bone chips to travel away from the cutter, it enables the instrument to produce a faster and cooler bone cut.  As shown in FIG.\n3, openings can be provided adjacent cutting surfaces to provide a "funnel" that permits bone chips to efficiently flow from the face of the reamer to avoid additional torque requirements to drive the cutter.  Without such openings, increased torque is\nrequired to drive the cutting tool and such increased torque is usually accompanied by increased axial pressure as the operator senses the resistance in advancing the cutter and applies increased loads.  This combination generates increased heat through\nfriction capable of generating temperatures which can cause bone necrosis.\n Manufacturing of Cutting Tools\n In some embodiments, the novel cutting tools can be manufactured by forming the spherical body and teeth from thinner sheet metal, 0.005\'\'-0.020\'\', which can improve the efficiency in manufacturing (longer tool life of the forming tools) and\nability to create a sharp tooth edge without a specific sharpening operation.  In addition the thinner material better dissipates the heat generated from the friction of cutting the bone over a thicker walled, heavier mass reamer.  The thinner material\nalso produces less friction, therefore a lower temperature at the surface, through reduction of the Coriolis forces (FIG. 9).\n FIG. 10 illustrates a comparison of the frictional forces associated with bone chips created by cutting tools having different thicknesses.  As shown in FIG. 10, for thicker walled cutters (e.g., cutters with wall thicknesses greater than\n0.22\'\'), the bone chip particles must travel a greater distance in contact with the cutting surface of the cutter.  As a result, lower temperatures can be achieved by producing cutters with wall thickness of between 0.005\'\' and 0.020\'\'.  The following\nnovel manufacturing methods can be used to produce cutting tools with such reduced wall thicknesses.\n FIG. 11 illustrates exemplary operations for manufacturing cutting tools.  As shown in FIG. 11, panels can be formed with multiple teeth designs and a reamer can be assembled as shown.  This design and method of manufacturing a spherical reamer\ncan be faster and more efficient than conventional techniques.  In some embodiments, this method can be produced in fewer steps, such as in nine operations.  In comparison, some conventional approaches of manufacturing of cutting tools can require\nhundreds of operations to form a spherical reamer.\n As shown in FIG. 11, stamped cutting panels can be formed by punching cavities in a flat sheet, forming holes for receiving bone chips, and setting panel curvature and teeth height.  A center support, base, and dome can be formed and assembled\nwith the panels to form a single cutting tool.  Thus, for example, in some embodiments, the following steps can be taken: 1.  The specific tooth cutting angle is punched into a flat metal blank with accuracy of 0.001.+-.0.0005\'\' as the first step.  Angle\ncan be set based on intended cutting requirements of the bone.  2.  Punch opening for bone chips around tooth and create cutting edge.  3.  Form spherical section from the flat metal blank and elevate all teeth above spherical surface with tooth\nelevation tolerance of .+-.0.002\'\'.  Teeth are formed as contours of the intended spherical surfaces as opposed to just straight edges.  The opening around the teeth can be further formed into funnels at specific angles to direct the bone chips away from\nthe outer surface and into the hollow cavity of the cutter.  4.  Multiple panels are formed (3 to 8 for example) which are assembled and laser welded together forming a spherical reamer.\n Using the manufacturing techniques described herein, any number of teeth (e.g., 1-20 or more) can be made in a single forming step.  In contrast, conventional systems require multiple forming steps for each individual tooth.  Because the number\nof operations required to manufacture a spherical reamer can be greatly reduced, the costs are similarly reduced, thereby providing a lower cost, yet equally effective, cutting tool that can be removed from clinical service at a the end of its functional\nlife without significant financial loss.\n It should be understood that the supporting structure for the panels can be formed in various manners.  For example, FIG. 12 illustrates an alternative approach in which the panels are secured by a plastic molded part.\n In some embodiments, the panels are placed directly into an injection molding tool and a medical grade plastic (e.g., PEI (polyetherimide, ULTEM.RTM.), PEEK (polyetheretherketone), PAI (polyamidide, TORLON.RTM.) can be injected around the\nperiphery of the panels creating a frame that encloses and secures the panels.  FIG. 13 illustrates a similar structure to that illustrated in FIG. 12; however, instead of a spherical reamer, FIG. 13 depicts a cylindrical reamer.\n The cutting tools can be color coded to facilitate identification of the various sizes and types of cutting tools.  When the cutting tool frames are formed by injection molding, such color coding can be achieved by varying the color of the\ninjection molded plastic part.\n Laboratory testing of a disclosed embodiment provided a comparison to existing art spherical reamers.  Bovine bone specimens were used to monitor the speed to prepare a standard preparation, the temperature generated during that preparation and\nhow many preparations could be completed before cutting edge damage generated a temperature exposure to the bone above 50.degree.  C. (122.degree.  F.).  FIG. 12 summarizes the results of this testing and illustrates some of the improvements, such as the\nability to cut bone at a lower temperature for a greater number of uses.\n All cutting tools will eventually wear at the cutting edges resulting in a non-efficient cutter which would need to be sharpened or discarded.  This is true of all industries including the medical field where these cutters are machining bone. \nIn this field, the consequences of the cutter becoming dull and continuing to use it can result in bone necrosis.  This in turn can jeopardize the success of the surgical procedure as the prosthesis must be supported by live, healthy bone to stabilize\nthe implant.  Excessive heat will kill the bone leading to bone resorption and a less than ideal interference fit between the bone and the implant.  The rounding of the teeth cutting edges and damage to these edges can be demonstrated after 4-6 uses of\nthese reamers in cow bone.  It is for that reason all cutters should be qualified through laboratory testing to define the maximum number of uses under worst-case conditions which will not violate the temperature threshold for killing bone.  This test\nresult can then be used as a method to identify when the cutter should be removed from use.\n FIG. 14 illustrates a laboratory test set-up for determining the effective functional life of a cutting tool.  In these tests, acetabular reamers were used to cut bone (i.e., cortical bovine bone) to determine the number of uses the acetabular\nreamers can experience before the end of their effective functional life.  In one example, it was determined that approximately six (6) uses of the reamer produces a complete preparation without generating excessive heat (e.g., temperatures at or above\n122.degree.  F. (50.degree.  C.)).\n FIG. 14 also illustrates the results of an acetabular reamer evaluation in bovine bone, including (1) a chart showing the functional evaluation of a 50 mm acetabular reamer to cut bovine bone, graphing the number of bone preparations (i.e., uses\nof the cutting tool) and the temperature in the bone preparation area; and (2) a chart showing the functional evaluation of a 50 mm acetabular reamer to cut bovine bone, graphing the number of bone preparations (i.e., uses of the cutting tool) and the\ntime required to achieve the bone preparation.  As shown in FIG. 14, continuing to use the cutter after the sixth use consistently resulted in a longer preparation time and increased heat generation.  The sharpness of the teeth cutting edges are directly\nproportional to the load required to advance the cutter, and therefore the resulting friction/heat generated.  As the cutting edge rounds (or dulls), it becomes less effective in penetrating the surface of the bone and requires additional load to attempt\nto advance it.  This cutter wear is generally consistent for all cutting tools.\n FIG. 15 illustrates exemplary cutting tools of at least some of the disclosed embodiments, including a spherical reamer, long bone tapered reamer, cylindrical reamer, and patellar reamer.  The cutting tools and methods of manufacturing the same\ncan provide a number of improvements, including (in certain embodiments) at least some of the following improvements: 1.  Multiple teeth designs and teeth orientations to address multiple machining needs of the bone yielding a faster, cooler cut.  2. \nTooth design geometries which address side cutting, end cutting and a combination of both.  3.  A thinner material for forming the spherical reamer which can improve sharpness and reduction of heat.  4.  A thinner material which also provides for more\nefficient forming of teeth and component parts improving manufacturing tool life.  5.  Ability to produce multiple teeth designs and multiple teeth in fewer manufacturing steps.  6.  A method of assembling a spherical reamer using multiple panels,\npre-stamped with teeth of specific geometry and orientation.\n The novel approach to producing more efficient medical reamers described herein can help ensure a proper bone preparation for every patient.  In addition, the cutting tools described herein can provide improved sharpness, reduced heat during the\nreaming and a faster preparation based on tooth geometry and orientation.  These improvements are also possible through a less expensive manufacturing process which makes it more economical to discard the reamer when it becomes dull.\n Functional Life of Cutting Tools\n It is also desirable to understand the effective functional life of the cutting tools described herein.  As with any cutting tool, no matter how efficient the cutter has been designed, it will dull after multiple uses and its effective life will\nhave terminated.  Currently medical spherical reamers are used multiple times without any monitoring of the status of where the cutter is in its life cycle.  Hospitals receive a new spherical reamer and follow an instrument processing procedure that\nincludes cleaning, sterilizing, use, cleaning, sterilizing, and reuse.  However, that cycle can continue for many, many surgical procedures before a surgeon notices the reamer is not cutting well.\n Cutting teeth dull after even a few uses and dull cutting teeth generating heat that can be sufficient to cause bone necrosis.  Accordingly, in addition to improving teeth design, it can also be helpful to provide the ability to indicate when a\ncutter should be removed from use to avoid issues relating to bone necrosis from dull cutters.  In conventional approaches, instruments are used in hospitals on patients many times without knowledge of the life expectancy of the reamer and often beyond\nthe functional life of the instrument.  Some of the reluctance to discard the instrument after a single use is the cost of manufacturing these instruments.  It is also perceived by the medical industry through orthopedic surgeons that these instruments\ndo have a functional life greater than a single use.  Accordingly, significant improvements in manufacturing costs, such as those realized by the embodiments described herein, can help to reduce the number of uses needed to obtain a return on investment.\n As described above, the methods described herein can create more cost effective cutting tools, such as spherical reamers.  In addition, the methods described herein can provide a means for defining the effective functional life of the cutting\ntools and providing a method of knowing when to discard it to ensure that the cutting tool used for any procedure (e.g., a total hip procedure) will be effective for its intended purpose.\n In at least some of the embodiments described herein, as described above, novel medical reamers can include at least some of the following design parameters, enabling the production of more efficient tools for cutting bone: 1.  Optimize forces\napplied to the reamer.  2.  Thin, sharp tooth edge.  3.  Specific tooth designs and tooth orientations providing a faster completion of the reaming cycle.  4.  Adequate bone chip exit path to minimize friction from the flow of the chips at the cutter\nsurface.  5.  Minimize friction from cutting by using thinner materials and improved tooth geometry.  6.  Define the functional life of the cutting edges through laboratory testing to know when to discard the reamer.  7.  Provide an improved and\nefficient manufacturing process.\n Laboratory testing to confirm an improved speed of the preparation, a lower cutting exposure temperature to the bone and an increased functional life to the reamer.\n It should also be understood that these design principles can be incorporated into other cutting tools than those described in the figures, such as medical reamers that are used for patella resurfacing, glenoid reaming and machining the canal of\nlong bones.\n In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and should not be taken as limiting\nthe scope of the invention.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

 'patent_description': u'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to hip replacement systems; and, more particularly, to a femoral hip stem explant system for the removal of remnant cement mantle following the removal of a femoral prosthesis.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Many patents address issues related to removal of a cement mantle incorporated in the bone cavity, typically used to attach a femoral implant.  The femoral implant must be extracted and replaced with a new implant when the implant sockets have\nworn out or due to poor bond formation.  The prosthesis is easily extracted by the application of pressure, but the bone cement mantle used during the implant procedure remains attached to the bone cavity and must be removed by drilling, dissolution or\nother means.  Most commonly used methods include free hand drilling wherein the surgeon uses a drill to approximate the location of the bone cement mantle and significant damage may occur to the bone canal including bone fracture which precludes the\npossibility of a new implant.  In some cases the surgeons use an x-ray fluoroscope to get an outline of the bone cavity and the drill, to manually guide the drill within the bone cavity when drilling out bone cement mantle.  Drilling of a hardened bone\ncement mantle can result in heat generation that may damage bone tissue adjacent to the mantle.  This damage may prevent bond formation between the femoral bone and the newly implanted femoral implant.  It is therefore necessary to limit the amount of\nheat generated during this bone cement mantle removal procedure.  Methods of bone cement mantle removal disclosed in prior art patents generally comprise (i) sawing, to cuts along the side of the mantle; grinding, using a tracing grinding element, the\npath of which tracks a template; (iii) casting, to cast a resin inside the bone cavity; and (iv) pulling on the resin, to forcefully remove the bone cement mantle.  In lieu of pulling on the resin, there is used a fixture that is attached to the femoral\nbone by interference.  This fixture carries a drill that is translated to drill out the bone cement mantle.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,476,861 to Dimakos et al. discloses an instrument for removal of a hollow bone cement tube from an artificial femur head reimplantation.  This instrument has an elongate hollow tube adapted to be inserted into the bone cement\ntube.  The end of the hollow tube within the bone canal has a collet comprising a slot.  The slot is expanded by a central mandrel rod so that the collect engages the end of the bone cement tube.  A cylindrical striker sliding on the hollow tube applies\npressure to the bone cement tube enabling its extraction.  For this device to work, a free end that is essentially flat must be available within the bone cement tube so that the collet may be engaged for extraction.  This feature is oftentimes\nunavailable.  Moreover, a large amount of force must be applied to release and displace the bone cement tube, which may not be available by the simple back and forth movement of the cylindrical striker.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,702,236 to Tarabichy et al. discloses a revision arthroplasty method and related instrument.  This method is for revision arthroplasty or the removal of a loosened or defective prosthesis component set in a bone cavity using\npolymer cement.  The loosened or defective prosthesis is then removed out of the bone cavity.  Cement is then removed from the cavity by the use of an instrument having a heated working end.  Heating the working end to a temperature exceeding the melting\npoint of the cement enables cement to be removed without perforating or damaging the bone.  Such heat in the range of 150.degree.  C.-200.degree.  C. provides an invasive procedure, and can be damaging to bone tissue, preventing bond formation of an\nimplanted prosthesis.\n U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,846,161 and 4,986,826 to Roger disclose a method and apparatus for removing prosthetic cement.  This method and device is for use in removing the prosthetic cement from a bone in which an artificial joint, such as hip joint,\nis to be replaced.  The device cuts the prosthetic cement in a longitudinal plane of the prosthetic cavity to the complete depth of the cement, without substantially cutting into the bone.  The device includes a reciprocating saw head, which is advanced\nlongitudinally of the cavity and is maintained within the preselected longitudinal plane of the cavity by a guide while it cuts through the cement.  The saw head is transversly biased towards the cement, so that it cuts only to a depth defined by the\nprofile of a template.  The profile of the template is obtained from X-ray information obtained before commencement of the operation.  This reciprocating cutting action only produces a cut in the longitudinal plane of the prosthetic cement.  Such a cut\ndoes not guarantee easy removal of the prosthetic cement, since the cement is shown to be three dimensional in structure matching the shape of the template.  Cutting debris is left behind within the bone cavity, and excessive heating is generated by the\ncutting action, damaging bone tissue.  Multiple cuts are needed to effect any removal of the prosthetic cement.  The bottom plug of the prosthetic cement is said to be removed by this removal procedure.  However, the saw does not reach the very bottom of\nthe cavity.  Consequently, these multiple sections are still held together by the bottom uncut portion, making the removal of the prosthetic cement difficult.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,860,735 to Davey et al. discloses a drill alignment guide for osteoplastic surgery.  This drill alignment apparatus for osteoplastic surgery comprises an alignment rod mounted on one or two spaced clamp elements.  The alignment\nrod is parallel to and is disposed at a predetermined distance from a shaft of the drill.  The clamp element includes an aperture, which permits passage of the rod.  The clamp element is adapted to be affixed to a bone, such as a femur, by interference. \nWith this arrangement, the aperture is displaced from the central axis of the bone by substantially the same distance that the center axis of the alignment rod is displaced from the center axis of the drill shaft.  When drilling is commenced, the forward\nend of the alignment rod is placed within the aperture of the clamp element.  As drilling progresses, the rod passes through the aperture, thereby ensuring that drilling occurs along a predetermined drilling path extending along the bone axis.  The\nclamping elements merely rest on the femoral bone with no bottom support.  Accordingly, they are subject to lifting, especially when a drilling load is applied.  When two clamping elements are used, the parallelism of the alignment rod with respect to\nthe bone cavity is not possible, since the shape of the femoral bone is not exactly cylindrical.  An alignment rod support is used to attach the drill to the alignment rod.  Thus supported, the alignment rod progressively passes through the aperture in\none or two clamp elements as the drill enters through the intramedullary bone canal.  However, vertical displacement of the clamp element without any bottom support can cause drilling in a path that is not concentric with the intramedullary bone canal.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,919,153 to Chin discloses a method and apparatus for removing pre-placed prosthetic joints and preparing for their replacement.  This method and apparatus removes a pre-placed prosthetic joint from a bone cavity and conditions\nthe cavity for receipt of a replacement joint.  The pre-placed joint is first pulled from the mantle of hardened methylmethacrylate cement holding it within the cavity, thus leaving a cavity within the mantle.  A mass of fluid methylmethacrylate cement\nis then placed within the cement cavity.  A pulling appliance is inserted into the fluid cement and the fluid cement is permitted to cure to bond the appliance to the mantle.  Tension is then applied to the pulling appliance to remove the appliance and\nthe cement mantle from the bone cavity as a unit.  The fluid cement partially dissolves and softens the hardened cement mantle so that an integral cement mass is formed upon curing of the fluid cement.  The pulling appliance is of a screw-like\nconfiguration, with means to connect a slap-hammer to its proximal end.  The curing of the fluid methylmethacrylate occurs by exothermic reaction of liquid methyl methacrylate monomer with a finely divided powder mixture of polymethyl methacrylate,\nmethyl methacrylate-styrene-copolymer.  This exothermic reaction results in large heat generation, damaging bone tissue and resulting in poor bonding of the new implant.  The removal of the bone cement mantle within the cavity by this pulling method\nrequires the cavity to be uniformly tapered outward with the progressively larger dimension towards the bone canal opening.  This may not be the case in all intramedullary bone canals since the femoral implant is forced into the canal with the bone\ncement.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,041,120 to McColl et al. discloses a multipart kit and method of using the same to remove cement used to secure prosthetic joints.  A mantle of cement within a bone elongate cavity is removed from the adhered condition by\nsuccessively breaking away sections of the mantle with a plurality of elongate screw threaded pulling elements proportioned to engage a limited length of a screw threaded mass of cement within the cavity.  The apparatus is provided in a kit form having a\nsufficient number of elements to enable the full length of the mantle to be removed in successive steps.  The kit may also include a cement injection syringe and vent tube to fill the cavity of the mantle with a mass of cement, a die to form a screw\nthreaded passage in the mass of cement, and a slap hammer connectable to the pulling elements.  This method of removal requires direct attachment by screw thread to a portion of the remaining mantle of cement or attachment of a threaded pulling element\nby fresh methylmethacrylate cement, which is said to soften the old mantle of cement.  Such softening prevents bond creation between the old cement mantle and the freshly applied methylmethacrylate preventing any removal of the old cement mantle. \nMoreover, methylmethacrylate is a brittle resin and will readily fracture upon being subjected to tensile pull by slap hammer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,064,426 to Huebsch discloses an apparatus for removal of bone cement.  Bone cement is removed from a bone cavity, such as the intramedullary canal, during a prosthetic revision.  The bone cement is pre-molded by a thermal\nchisel, which includes a shaft for extending into the bone cavity, a plasticizer chisel on a working end of the shaft, and a heat element carried by the shaft for heating the chisel to a temperature within a range of temperatures sufficient to plasticize\nthe bone cement.  This deforms and weakens the bone cement upon direct non-impact type contact between the heated tip of the chisel and the cement.  The cement is removed by pre-molding it with the heated working end of the thermal chisel, preferably by\nmolding a distally located circumferential furrow in the bone cement and then molding circumferentially spaced apart longitudinal furrows from the circumferential groove to the proximal end of the bone cement.  Upon rehardening of the bone cement, these\nthermally molded furrows form weakened areas within the bone cement so that the regions of bone cement between the weakened areas can be removed by an impact type chisel.  Use of this heated tip raises the temperature of the cement sufficiently to melt\nor soften the cement.  The bone tissue that is in direct contact with the cement also reaches the same softening or melting temperature, which is a fixed temperature according to the composition of the cement used.  Exposure of the bone tissue to such\nhigh temperatures compromises the ability of the bone tissue to heal and bond to a new implanted femoral prosthesis.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,152,792 to Watkins et al. discloses an apparatus and method for gauging and controlling process steps used to remove prosthetic joints.  Over tightening of the threaded rods used to engage and remove the cement for prosthetic\njoints is avoided by measuring the depth of the passages into which the rods are threaded.  Sleeves on the rods are provided to serve as visual indicia of the extent of penetration of the rods into the cement.  A depth gauge is calibrated in both units\nof length and screw thread turns, for the measuring function.  The sleeves are slidably received on the rods and proportioned to engage the edges of the passages into which the rods are threaded.  In use, the sleeves slide toward a marker as the rods are\nthreaded into place.  Sequentially sized tools are screwed into the mass of cement injected into the bone cement mantle and torsional and pulling force is applied to extract the bone cement mantle.  Insertion and hardening of the cement into the bone\ncement mantle takes time, and the fluid cement injected is said to soften or partially dissolve the bone cement mantle.  As a result, the bond between the poured cement and the bone cement mantle is weak and the application of torsional and pulling\nforces may separate at this interface between the injected cement and the bone mantle cement, resulting in incomplete or poor extraction of the bone cement mantle.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,167,619 to Wuchinich discloses an apparatus and method for removal of cement from bone cavities.  This surgical apparatus has a hand piece with a vibration source for generating mechanical vibrations in response to current\nsupplied to the vibrator.  A elongated hollow tool is attached to the vibration source of the hand piece.  The tool extends away from the hand piece to the cement to be removed.  Cement is removed using the surgical apparatus by applying the tool to the\ncement and thereby applying mechanical vibration to the cement, causing the cement to melt.  Removal of cement is accomplished by suction through the hollow elongated tool.  In an alternate method, the tool is rotated to apply shear forces to the cement\nbeing removed.  The tool is then cooled, used to damp lateral vibrations at the tool end.  The cement is irrigated, while being melted and removed.  In this arrangement, the vibratory and rotary motion of the tool creates sufficient friction generated\nheat to melt the bone cement mantle, causing molten cement to be drawn through the central aperture of the hollow tube.  Since the bone cement mantle is in intimate contact with the bone tissue, such heat generation exposes the bone tissue to heat,\npreventing its ability to heal and bond to a new implant.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,190,551 to Chin et al. discloses a controlled apparatus and method for extracting cement mantles from bone recesses.  A cement plug, received within a bone recess, is extracted by forming a bore within the plug, tapping the\nbore to form internal screw threads therein, engaging the threads with a pulling tool, and applying tension to the tool to extract the plug.  The method for removing a cement mantle includes steps of: (i) filling the bone cavity with a fluid cement; (ii)\ninserting an elongate curvilinear rod in the fluid cement; (iii) curing the fluid cement, rod, and mantle to form a unitary mass; (iv) withdrawing the curvilinear rod from the mass; (v) tapping to form a screw-threaded section therein; (vi) engaging the\nscrew-threaded section of the bore with a pulling tool; and (vii) imparting pulling force to the pulling tool to remove that portion of the mass within which the tool is thread-ably engaged from the recess.  The curing of the fluid cement takes time,\nwhich is not generally available in a surgical situation.  For this technique to work, the fluid cement must form an intimate bond with the bone cement mantle.  Otherwise, the pulled rod, together with the hardened fluid cement, extracts without pulling\nthe bone cement mantle from the bone cavity.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,222,957 to McColl et al. discloses a method and apparatus for extracting a cement mantle from a bone recess.  This method and apparatus effects removal of a pre-placed prosthetic appliance, anchored in place in a bone recess by\na cement mantle, and conditions the recess for receipt of a replacement appliance.  The preplaced appliance is first pulled from the mantle of hardened cement, holding it within the recess, thus leaving a cavity within the mantle.  A screw threaded post\nhaving nuts threadably engaged therewith at longitudinally spaced locations is then anchored within the cavity with a new mass of cement.  Thereafter, the post is threadably disengaged from the nuts, leaving the nuts in place within the new mass of\ncement.  A pulling tool is then successively engaged with the nuts and tensioned to incrementally remove the mantle from the recess.  The hardening of the new mass cement within bone cement mantle requires time, which is not generally available during\nsurgical procedure.  In order to harden a new mass of cement incrementally in one-half inch increments, the bone cement mantle must intimately bond with the old bone cement mantle, and the hardened new mass of cement must fracture at specified\nincremental locations.  In practice, these features may not readily occur, leaving portions of the bone cement mantle within the bone cavity.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,413,578 to Zahedi discloses a device for removing a bone cement tube.  This device for removing a bone cement tube in a bone cavity after the removal of the endoprosthesis comprises an ultrasonic generator with an essentially\ncylindrical guide section, the free end of which carries the sonotrode, which emits the ultrasound.  The diameter of the guide section is less than the internal diameter of the bone cement tube, and its length is adapted to the length of the prosthesis\nshaft or to the length of the bone cement tube.  It has been found that a layer of cement, which covers a bone substance, loosens when it is ultrasonically radiated with a frequency in the region of 40 kHz.  This cement layer can be removed from the\nsurface of the bone as a complete block of cement.  The substance of the bone is not weakened due to this procedure.  Since the ultrasonic frequency is emitted by the sonotube, an ultrasonic coupling agent must be disposed between the sonotube and the\nbone cement tube in order to couple the ultrasonic frequency energy.  No such coupling agent is indicated, with the result that energy transfer to the bone cement tube will be inefficient.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,470,336 to Ling et al. discloses a system for performing hip prosthesis revision surgery.  This hip prosthesis revision surgery apparatus includes means for preparation of the cavity left after removal of the original\nprosthesis.  The old bone cement tube or mantle is completely removed first by drilling and by progressively increased sizes of reamers.  The old restrictor at the bottom of the bone cavity is also removed.  The reamed bone cavity is larger in size than\nthat needed for the new implant, and is shaped to proper size by tamping cancellous bone graft material.  Following removal of the old prosthesis, old cement and old restrictor, a new cement restrictor or plug is placed at or near the bottom of the\ncavity in femur.  A guide-wire, having external threads, is threadedly engaged with the new restrictor.  A tamp having a stem portion and a longitudinal passageway is inserted into the cavity.  The tamp is positioned to be driven into the cavity by means\nof the rasp handle, which is impacted by a hammer or other impacting device as it is driven to the desired position within the cavity to crush the cancellous bone graft to a desired density.  Following tamping of the cancellous bone graft material to the\ndesired density and the resultant formation of a cavity having the proper size and shape, the tamp may be removed from the newly formed cavity.  The rasp handle is then removed and the guide-wire may be unscrewed and removed from the restrictor.  The new\ncavity is now ready to receive the new prosthesis.  The \'336 patent disclosure deals with packing a larger sized bone cavity with graft material.  It does not address removal of old bone cement mantle that is present when a damaged or worn out femoral\nimplant is removed.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,649,930 to Kertzner discloses an orthopedic centering tool.  This centering tool is guides a surgical drill bit through the center of a target obstruction within a bone.  An adjustable frame of the centering tool includes a\npair of right angle sections mounted in a mirror image relationship.  The sections are adjustably clamped to one another and, in turn, secure a vertical sleeve for guiding a surgical drill bit and a horizontal sleeve for accommodating an anchor pin\nwithin a coplanar arrangement.  Various clamps associated with the frame elements and the sleeves permit a surgeon to adjust the tool so that the drill bit is guided through the vertical sleeve to the approximate center of the bone immediately below the\nobstruction, while the pin anchors the frame to the bone.  The surgical frame is attached to the femoral bone in one location only and the frame is therefore rotatable around this femoral bone attachment point, especially when drilling loads are applied\nto the vertical sleeve.  Any such rotation will lead to meandering of the drill bit within the bone cavity that is being drilled to remove bone cement mantle, causing permanent damage to the bone tissue.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,190,392 to Vandewalle et al. discloses a method and apparatus for ultrasonic removal of bone cement material.  Ultrasonic removal of bone cement material is accomplished using an auger tool and an ultrasonic transducer/hand\npiece.  The auger tool includes a spiral helical flute, which extends about a cylindrical body.  A quick connect mechanism couples the auger tool to the ultrasonic transducer/hand piece.  Upon energizing the hand piece, bone cement is heated to a flowing\nmass so that the flowing mass of bone cement may flow about the cylindrical body and be guided via the spiral helical flute.  Removal of bone cement material is accomplished easily and quickly during a revision type orthopedic surgical procedure.  The\nauger tool is vibrated with sufficient ultrasonic power to cause the bone cement to melt, and the molten cement is guided along the helical flute path.  The bone tissue directly below the molten bone cement mantle reaches the melting point of the bone\ncement.  Consequently, the heating temperature employed by the method and apparatus of the \'392 patent is oftentimes sufficient to damage bone tissue.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,270,502 to Stulberg discloses methods and instruments for performing radial impacting.  This radial impacting technique involves using a set of progressively larger radial impactors to pack a medullary canal in a radial\ndirection toward the cortex.  For revision cases, graft material, which may be either synthetic or bone graft material, is added into the medullary canal after the previously installed implant has been removed.  Packing the medullary canal in the radial\ndirection, as opposed to the conventional approach of packing in a distal direction, is said to provide superior results.  The radial impactors are preferably cannulated and may also have holes to assist in the removal of fluids from within the medullary\ncanal.  The profile impactors may be either cannulated or non-cannulated and prepare the medullary canal for receipt of the implant.  The \'502 patent disclosure deals with packing a bone cavity with graft material.  It does not disclose or suggest\nremoving old bone cement mantle that is present when a damaged or worn out femoral implant is removed.\n "Controlled Perforation: A Safe Method of Cement Removal from the Femoral Canal", Sydney et al., Clin. Orthop.  Relat.  Res., 253, April 1990, pp 168-172 discloses a method for removal of cement from a femoral canal.  This method involves\nremoval of cement from the canal by way of placing multiple 9-mm perforations at least 5 cm apart on the anterior surface of the femoral shaft.  According to the disclosure, the tip of the revision stem should be at least 5 cm distal to the most distal\nperforation.  From January 1984 to December 1986, there were 219 cases of revision total hip arthroplasties performed using this technique.  The incidence of ipsilateral postoperative femoral fractures was nine out of 219.  Eight of these fractures were\nat the tip or distal to the femoral prosthesis and were associated with trauma.  One fracture occurred through a perforation site and had an associated fracture of the femoral component.  Accordingly, this method of drilling multiple 9 mm perforations\ndisclosed by the Sydney et al. publication results in an unreliable surgical procedure.\n "A Device for Removal of Femoral Distal Cement Plug During Hip Revision Arthroplasty: A High-Powered Drill Equipped with a Centralizer", Jingushi et al., The Journal of Anthroplasty, Vol. 15, Iss.  2, February 2000, pp 231-233 discloses removal\nof a femoral cement mantle in hip revision arthroplasty by way of a high-powered drill.  The high-powered drill is equipped with a centralizer developed to remove the distal cement plug safely.  Using the drill equipped with a centralizer the cement plug\nis removed well enough to insert a new component without causing perforation during the operation.  The bone cement mantle in the bone cavity is not indicated to be removed by the centralizer mounted high powered drill.  Only the bottom cement plug is\nsaid to be safely removed.\n "Segmental Cement Extraction at Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty", Schurman et al., Clin. Orthop.  Relat.  Res., 285, December 1992, pp 158-163 discloses a method for segmented cement extraction during revision surgery.  This technique permits\nsegmental extraction of bone cement from the femoral canal through the introduction of fresh cement into the old cement mantle and placement of a threaded rod into the wet cement.  The threaded rod is held in place while the cement hardens.  The\nthread-forming rod is then removed leaving a threaded channel in the cement.  Extraction rods are then screwed 1.5 to 2.5 cm into the threaded channel.  A slap hammer, which attaches to the opposite end of the extraction rod, is used to remove 1.5- to\n2.5-cm segments of cement.  Fifteen cases involving revision of cemented femoral components were analyzed using the `Segmental Cement Extraction reference system.  Complete cement removal was achieved in 12 cases.  The method produced less damage to the\nfemur when compared with conventional methods.  In two cases, there was retained cement along the medial wall of the femur and, in one case, the plug could not be extracted using the `Segmental Cement Extraction reference\'s method.  This method requires\nthe fresh cement to bond to bone cement mantle.  It requires the fresh cement to break at screw insertion depth, and to carry with it a portion of the bone cement mantle.  If the bond between the bone cement mantle and the fresh cement is weak, the bone\ncement mantle is not extracted.  If the fresh cement cures to a stronger cement, fracture may occur unpredictably, creating bone cement extraction problems.\n There remains a need in the art for a femoral hip stem explant system that reliably and safely removes any remaining bone cement mantle and bottom plug without damaging the bone tissue due to poor drill or reamer placement or subjecting the bone\ntissue to excessive heat.  Also needed is a femoral hip stem explant system that removes all residue of the bone cement within a reasonable time period, so that the operating time is not excessively prolonged.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The femoral hip stem explant system for removing bone cement mantle from an existing bone cavity.  A set of reamers, end mills, sleeve members and an alignment body are adjusted to provide supporting arrangement.  The adjustment is such that the\nreamers, end mills, sleeve members and alignment body line up precisely and reliably with the existing bone cavity from which a bone cement mantle is to be removed.\n The alignment body comprises two bone saddles, a tie rod with a central bore and a drill guide body and set of sleeves that support the shaft of the reamers or end mills.  The two bone saddles are removably affixed to the femoral bone using two\ndisposable polymeric ties that are inserted behind the femoral bone using a special tool, preventing any movement.  The bone saddles are spaced apart from each other and the bottom portion of the bone saddle contacts the femoral bone.  This bone\ncontacting portion of the bone saddle has a semi-cylindrical shape with serrations to increase friction against the bone.  The disposable plastic tie surrounds the femoral bone and passes through a channel in the bone saddle, firmly anchoring the bottom\nportion of the bone saddle against the femoral bone.  The distal portion of the bone saddle from the femoral bone has a rod portion which mates with a collet terminated support member having a circular aperture.  With this arrangement, the length of the\nbone saddle between its bone resting location and the centerline of the circular aperture may be increased or decreased by loosening the collet and locking it at a new position.\n After affixing the two bone saddles on the femoral bone, a tie rod with a central bore is inserted through the circular apertures of the two bone saddles.  The fit between the outer diameter of the tie rod and circular aperture of the bond\nsaddle is a snug fit assuring a reliable location and orientation of the tie rod when the collets of the bone saddles are locked.\n A drill guide body, which has a central rod and a perpendicular end projection is inserted into the central bore of the tie rod.  The insertion depth of the drill guide body, as well as its angular orientation relative to the plane formed by the\ntie rod and bone saddles, may be changed and locked.  The free end of the end projection carries a collet receives and mates with a rod portion of a drill guide having a circular aperture of a fixed diameter.  The drill guide receives a sleeve member,\nwhich snugly fits within the fixed diameter of the circular aperture of the drill guide.  The sleeve members come in different sizes, each having a specific aperture matching the shaft diameter of a particular reamer or an end mill.  Collectively, the\nsleeve members provide complete support to the high speed rotation of the end mill or reamer during the removal of the bone cement mantle.  Each sleeve member has a stop that prevents the sleeve member from going through the circular aperture of the\ndrill guide.  The inserted end of the sleeve member has a conical friction sleeve for engagement with the bone cavity.\n In operation, the femoral bone is exposed in two places for attachment of the two bone saddles.  The disposable polymeric ties are inserted behind the femoral bone using the special tool provided, and is threaded through the channel in the bone\nsaddle and secured using a tie clamp tool.  Due to the tension in the disposable polymeric tie, the bone saddles are firmly affixed to the femoral bone.  With the collets of the bone saddles still unlocked, the tie rod is inserted into the apertures of\nthe bone saddles, and its orientation is visually adjusted to be nearly parallel and equidistant from the bone cavity.  The drill guide body is inserted into the bore of the tie rod.  The length of the insertion of the drill guide body and its angular\norientation are adjusted so that the drill guide lines up with the bone cavity.  Now the sleeve member is inserted into the drill guide.  An end mill shaft is inserted into the bone cavity, and the shaft is passed through the drill guide to verify the\nalignment of all the collect locks and adjustable elements of the femoral hip stem explant system.  If necessary, individual collets are loosened and distances/angular orientations are adjusted until the shaft of the end mill lines up with the interior\nof the bone cavity.  All the collet locks are now tightened, securing the overall support for the reamer or end mill shaft.  Drilling out of the bone cement mantle can now be reliably conducted.  Following this set up procedure, which takes minimal time,\nthe shaft of the end mill reamer is attached to a high speed drill to ream out the bone cement mantle and end mill the end plug within the bone cavity.  Since the reamers provided are hollow, any reamed debris falls within the inside of the reamer and\nthe reaming action is smooth, and does not generate heat.  When the sleeve member is removed extracting the reamer, the debris is also removed leaving the bone canal cavity clean.\n The shaft of the reamer or the end mill is completely supported by the aperture of the sleeve member.  The sleeve member rests by friction within the bone cavity using the conical friction sleeve.  The sleeve member fits snugly within the drill\nguide circular aperture.  The drill guide is firmly supported by the alignment body, which is tightly attached to drill guide body.  The latter, together with the tie rod and two bone saddles, are firmly attached to the femoral bone by disposable plastic\nties and semi-cylindrical contact of the bone saddles against the femoral bone.  As a result, operation with any of the end mills or reamers of selected sizes, together with the matching sleeve member, results in precise, predictable removal of the bone\ncement mantle, without damaging underlying bone tissue.

Currently there are two methods of fixing these\nartificial hip implants to the bone, and therefore two designs: (i) cement fixation: wherein both the acetabular component and the femoral component are cemented into their respective bones; and (ii) cementless (press fit) fixation: wherein both the\nacetabular and femoral components are press-fit into their respective bones (without cement) in attempts for long-term fixation through biological in-growth (bone and/or soft tissue attaching to the implants).  Hybrid fixations are also sometimes\nutilized wherein the acetabular cup is inserted via press-fit (without cement) and the femoral stem is cemented, or visa versa.\n Methods to remove these implants with minimum bone loss are a critical aspect in providing the option to re-implant new hip prostheses once failure of the reconstruction has occurred through various avenues, including loosening and osteolysis. \nIn addressing cemented implants, instrument designs have been developed, proven and marketed to conservatively remove the acetabular component with minimum bone loss.  Instrument designs are also available to grip the femoral stem and remove it from the\ncement bed.  However, there still remains an issue in removing the remaining cement mantle from the bone after having extracted a cemented hip stem.  Most procedures described in the literature simply recommend using thin osteotomes (applicable to other\northopedic procedures) to fracture the remaining cement mantle and remove it from the femoral canal piece-by-piece.  This is a slow and tedious process, adding time to the revision procedure wherein the patient is under anesthesia, exposing the patient\nto a higher likelihood of infection.  Even so, the process still does not always provide full removal of the distal mantle, which may be required for hip revision due to infection.\n The femoral hip stem explant system is of a novel design focused on completely removing the remnant cement mantle following the removal of the femoral prosthesis.  Once the femoral stem has been removed through existing instrumentation, the\nspecifically designed instrumentation of the femoral hip stem explant system accomplishes the removal of bone cement mantle according to an accurate surgical protocol with minimal time period.  Advantages of the instrumentation design of the femoral hip\nstem explant system include: (1) reduced time for a revision hip procedure; (2) reduced likelihood of generating femoral fractures through the use of conventional osteotomes for removal of the bone cement mantle; (3) more accurate approach to cement\nremoval through establishing the central axis of the femur with a unique guiding system that uses the external and internal diameters of the femoral canal, both proximally and distally; and (4) an instrument design which can be used in a minimally\ninvasive approach to revision surgery as well as in conjunction with a computer controlled surgical navigation system to provide complete surgical details of the procedure from pre-operative analysis, surgical incision and intra-operative implementation\nof the instruments.\n In utilizing the femoral hip stem explant system, two locations are chosen on the femoral bone to attach two bone saddles, one proximally and one distally, in order to establish a centerline in the tie rod that is parallel to the centerline of\nthe femoral canal.  The system utilizes disposable plastic ties, which are inserted around the outside of the femoral bone in these two (2) locations one for each bone saddle.  An instrument for attaching these ties is provided.  At those locations, a\nbone saddle with collet lock providing bone saddle length adjustment is affixed to the femur bone.  With the two (2) locations established, a tie rod is assembled to these saddles using two apertures in the bone saddle and firmly held in place through a\ncollet--lock design.  The collet lock--bone saddles provide for height adjustment so this tie rod that can be positioned quickly parallel to the femur bone cavity centerline.  A drill guide body is then inserted into the central bore of the tie rod,\nwhich provides for adjustment medially and laterally so the drill guide aperture which is on the perpendicular portion of the drill guide body is in alignment with the center of the femoral canal.  A sleeve member is inserted into the drill guide which\nfits snugly and the conical friction member of the sleeve member.  Positioning of the sleeve member and the drill guide within the bone cavity verifies the alignment of the drill axis with the centerline of the bone cavity.\n Once the canal centerline has been established and verified, all the collet locks are tightened to establish accuracy of the alignment body.  The sleeve member can be withdrawn at this stage from the circular aperture in the drill guide without\nloosing the accuracy of alignment.  The sleeve members have a central aperture in diameter range from 5 mm to 9 mm, accommodating a plurality of shaft sizes of reamers or end mills.  All sleeves have a common outer diameter that snugly fits into the\ncircular aperture of the drill guide.  Sequentially, corresponding end mill type cutters are introduced along this aligned axis to a depth established by pre-operative radiographic analysis.  Once this degree of milling has been completed, the femoral\ncanal (through the drill guide) is further opened, depending on the extent of the cement mantle/radiographic assessment, to 10-18 mm, using hollow or solid reamers with a pilot (non-end-cutting tip) to maintain the alignment established by the end mill\ncutters.  At this point in the revision procedure, assessment is made to the extent of cement mantle removal and continued reaming is performed, as required.\n The hollow reamers utilized by the femoral hip stem explant system have been designed to cut bone cement (PMMA) in a more efficient manner by providing internal space to capture the debris and thereby reducing both the cutting temperature and\ntime required to remove the remnant cement mantle.  Both these features are important in reducing heat to the bone and reducing operating room time to a revision surgery.  In one embodiment, the hollow reamers are provided with a reusable shaft and a\ndisposable cutter.\n FIG. 1 is a schematic view of all the components of the Femoral Hip Stem Explant System, shown generally at 10.  The system comprises an alignment body 11, a set of reamers and end mills 15 and set of sleeve members 16.  The alignment body 11\nhas two bone saddles 12 that are placed\' and supported on the femoral bone and carry a tie rod 13, through the bore of which a drill guide body 14 is inserted.  The sleeve member 16 is inserted in the free end circular aperture of the drill guide body\nand supports the shaft portion of the reamers or end mills 15.  The disposable polymeric ties 17 are inserted to surround the femoral bone using the threading tool 18 anchoring the bottom portion of the bone saddle using tie clamp 19.  The length of the\nbone saddles as well as the length and angular orientation of the drill guide member may be adjusted and locked using collets as detailed in the following figures.\n FIG. 2 illustrates at 20 a schematic view of the steps involved in the attachment of two bone saddles to a femoral bone using disposable polymeric ties with a special threading tool.  The femoral bone is shown at 21.  The special threading\ninsertion tool 18 is first inserted below the bone and the disposable polymeric tie 17 is inserted into the tool to thread the tie directly under the femoral bone.  The bone saddle 12 has a channel at 25 through which the disposable polymeric tie is\ninserted when the semi circular cylindrical bottom portion 22 of the bone saddle 12 rests on the femoral bone 21 and the tie 17 is tightened to secure the two bone saddles against the femoral bone.  The bone saddle 12 has a collet 24.  Note that the top\nportion of the bone saddle is removed at this stage and only the collet 24 of the bone saddle 12 is visible in this photograph.\n FIG. 3 illustrates at 30 a schematic view of FIG. 2 with the tie rod 33 snugly inserted within the circular apertures 31 of two bone saddles 12 attached to a femoral bone 21 using disposable polymeric ties 17.  The fit between the circular\naperture 31 and the tie rod 33 is snug in the sense that it takes some effort to push the tie rod into the aperture.  At this stage, the two collet locks 32 of the bone saddles 12 are loose and the overall length of the bone saddle can be increased or\ndecreased so as to align the tie rod to be parallel to the bone cavity within the femoral bone.  Since the bone diameter is not the same everywhere, the extension distance of the bone saddles may not be equal.  The arrows indicate the direction of\nmovement of the bone saddle length adjustment.  In an embodiment alternative to the saddle and tie arrangement shown in FIG. 3, a clamping instrument comprising a plurality of moving members such as "V" brackets or a plurality of opposing, multiple\ntongues, is adapted to be displaced uniformly toward and away from the centerline of the instrument.\n FIG. 4 illustrates generally at 40 a schematic view of FIG. 3.  The drill guide body 41 has a rod portion that is snug-fit inserted within the bore of the tie rod 33.  The drill body has a perpendicular leg extension, which terminates at a rod\nportion 43 that mates adjustably with the collet 44 of a drill guide 42.  Due to the snug fit of the drill guide body into the tie rod, its extension beyond the extremity of the tie rod can be adjusted as shown by the arrow indication.  The angular\norientation of the drill guide perpendicular leg portion may be changed as shown by the rotation arrow.  Using these adjustment means, the drill guide circular aperture can be aligned, exactly matching the opening of the bone cavity.\n FIG. 5 illustrates at 50 a schematic view of FIG. 4.  The sleeve member 16 is inserted within the drill guide 42.  The conical friction generating tapered portion 52 of the sleeve member is inserted into the bone cavity 53 and, at this time, the\ncomplete alignment of the alignment body is completed by locking all the collets.  Sleeves are provided with specific cone sizes for each sleeve size of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19, 13, 14, 16 and 18 mm.  The centerline of the tie rod is shown at 54, which is\nparallel to the centerline of the bone cavity 53.  Now the sleeve member 16 could be pulled out from the circular aperture of the drill guide 42 without changing the overall alignment.  A reamer or an end mill can be inserted into the bone cavity passing\nthrough the circular aperture of the drill guide 42 with the shaft of the end mill or reamer extending outward from the cavity.  The shaft of the reamer or end mil is inserted into the sleeve member central bore.  The sleeve member is inserted back into\nthe drill guide as shown in the next figure, creating a support system for the shaft of the end mill or reamer that is in complete alignment with the center line of the bone cavity.\n FIG. 6 illustrates at 60 a schematic view of FIG. 5.  The sleeve member is inserted within the drill guide and the tapered portion of the sleeve member rests inside the bone cavity while the shaft of an end mill 15 passes through the central\naperture of the sleeve member.  The arrow indicates the direction of movement of the shaft during grinding off the end plug bone cement mantle.  The shaft may also represent a reamer shaft, which will be used in a similar manner.  In both cases, the\nshaft of the end mill or reamer is completely supported by the sleeve member and the alignment of the surgical operation is preserved by the alignment body that is fixed to the femoral bone.\n FIG. 7 illustrates a schematic view showing typical dimensions of various elements of the alignment body and typical movement dimensions available.  The dimensions are indicated in millimeters.\n FIG. 8 illustrates a schematic view showing typical dimensions of various end mills, reamers and sleeve members usable with the femoral hip stem explant system.  The hollow reamers have a blunt nose that has the same diameter as the next lower\ndimension reamer.  All sleeves of the femoral hip stem explant system have substantially the same outer diameter, which fits inside the circular aperture of the drill guide.\n FIG. 9 illustrates a schematic diagram of a reusable shaft that accepts disposable reamers.  The disposable reamers are fitted on the distal end of the shaft, which is inserted into the bone cavity first and the shaft is inserted into the sleeve\nmember central aperture to support the shaft during drill reaming.\n The femoral hip stem explant system comprises, in combination, the following salient features: 1.  An alignment body comprising at least two well separated bone saddles, a tie rod with a central bore, a drill guide body with a drill guide and a\nsleeve member selected from a set of sleeves; 2.  a set of differently sized end mills or drills or hollow or solid reamers or hollow reamers designed to progressively remove bone cement mantle; 3.  the bone saddles being length adjustable with collet\nlocks and having a semi-cylindrical serrated surface at one end designed to rest a femoral bone, and being secured by disposable polymeric ties that pass under the femoral bone and are tied to said bone saddle firmly, securing said bone saddles to\nfemoral bone; 4.  the bone saddles having an aperture distal from the femoral bone attachment location to receive a snugly fitted tie rod with a central bore; 5.  the bone saddle length being adjusted with collet locks setting the tie rod central axis\nand the centerline of femoral bone cavity parallel; 6.  the central bore of the tie rod receiving a snugly fitted shaft of a drill guide body that has a length adjustable perpendicular leg with a lockable collet that carries a drill guide; 7.  the drill\nguide body being adjusted in extension length and angular orientation to align central aperture of the drill guide with the bone cavity in the femoral bone; 8.  a shaft of end mill or reamer being inserted through a central bore of a sleeve member and\nthe sleeve member being inserted into the central aperture of the drill guide; 9.  the sleeve member having a conical frictional extension that rests inside the femoral bone cavity; and 10.  the shaft of a reamer or end mill being completely supported\nduring drilling by the sleeve member, which is completely supported by the alignment body, and the alignment body being initially adjusted to align the drill axis with the centerline of the femoral bone cavity, establishing a safe removal procedure for\nthe bone cement mantle.\n Salient features of a surgical procedure for using the femoral hip stem explant system are set forth below: 1.  selecting two well separated locations on the femoral bone for attachment of two bone saddles; 2.  inserting two disposable polymeric\nties under the femoral bone using a special threading tool; 3.  passing the disposable plastic ties through a channel in the bone saddle and firmly securing the bone saddle against the femoral bone; 4.  inserting a snugly fitting tie rod with a central\nbore into each aperture of the bone saddle; 5.  adjusting the length of the bone saddles by loosening collet locks and setting the centerline of the tie rod bore parallel to the centerline of the femoral bone cavity; 6.  inserting a snugly fitting drill\nguide body shaft into a central bore of said tie rod; 7.  adjusting the length of the perpendicular leg of said drill guide body by loosening the collet locks so that the central aperture of said drill guide is lined up with said femoral bone cavity; 8. \ninserting a sleeve member with a conical friction extension through said central aperture of the drill guide into said femoral bone cavity and verifying alignment, and locking all collet locks and adjustments; 9.  removing the sleeve member from said\ncentral aperture of the drill guide, reinserting back after insertion of the shaft of a reamer or end mill into said central aperture of the sleeve member, whereby precise drilling of bone cement mantle within the femoral bone cavity is accomplished due\nto the precise alignment of the bone drilling axis with that of the femoral bone cavity axis.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art.  For example, the\nsystem can be cannulated for ease of use and additional safety.  Such changes and modifications are considered to fall within the scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

 'patent_description': u'BACKGROUND OF THE\nINVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to implantable bone prostheses; and, more particularly, to a bone-compliant femoral stem for canines or humans having compatibility with natural bone.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Many patents address issues related to canine femoral and/or human femoral stems.  Some patents address adding geometrical features or cracks within the femoral stem to reduce the stiffness of the femoral stem and bring it closer to the\nstiffness of bone tissue.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,808,186 to Smith discloses a controlled stiffness femoral hip implant for use in the hip or other appropriate body joint.  In a hip, a ball member fixed to the femur is rotatably engaged with a cup-shaped socket member fixed to\nthe acetabulum of the pelvic bone.  The ball member is mounted on one end of a femoral component, which has an elongated stem receivable in the intramedullary canal of the femur.  The stem has a longitudinal channel, which lies in the coronal plane when\nthe stem is in the implanted condition.  The thickness of the stem channel is variable between the proximal and distal ends so as to affect the moment of inertia at any given location along its length to achieve stem flexibility, which substantially\ncorrelates to the flexibility of the bone.  The medial side of the length of the implant is milled out to form a channel shaped stem cross section.  The amount of material removed determines the resulting decrease in stiffness of the implant.  The\noutside geometry remains substantially unchanged with the exception of the open channel on the medial side of the implant.  Because of the reduction of the moment of inertia of the implant stem, it is more flexible.  It also exhibits higher stem stresses\nupon loading of the implant.  Therefore, a careful balance must be achieved between the amount of material removed from the stem and the expected stress levels expected by the particular size implant.  However, this milling or material removal operation\ncorrespondingly decreases the load carrying capacity of the stem and its flexure behavior is subject to buckling and other non-uniform deformation mechanisms.  At the contact location between bone and the implant, the modulus or stiffness has a very\nlarge change preventing proper load transfer to the bone.  This, in turn, leads to crack formation at the bone-implant interface.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,990,161 to Kampner discloses an implant with resorbable stem, providing a biodegradable anchor selected from the group consisting of polyesters of glycolic acid, polyesters of lactic acid, polyamides of alpha-amino acids,\nunmodified polymers, modified polymers, calcium hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate or polylactic acid for a permanent implant of a bone joint, e.g. hip, shoulder, knee or finger.  The biodegradable anchor is an elongated member having an exterior\nsurface, which tightly engages with a cavity in the bone and is substantially immovable within the cavity upon implant.  The anchor is secured by means of a non-resorbable attachment to the permanent implant.  This implant has a metallic nonresorbable\npermanent implant, which is covered by a resorbable anchor that is attached to permanent implant by non-resorbable attachment.  The implant fits tightly into a bone cavity.  As the resorbable anchor biodegrades, bone ingrowth occurs and the implant is\npermanently attached to the bone tissue.  At this stage, the function of the permanent implant is over and the biodegraded anchor takes all the load and does not stress the bone tissue.  The anchor is attached to the permanent implant by non-resorbable\nattachments.  However, as the biodegradable anchor deteriorates and bone regrowth occurs, the anchor and its attachment is weakened.  During this interim healing period, the implant is clearly unstable and is subject to movement causing bone-healing\nproblems.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,314,492 to Hamilton et al. discloses a composite prosthesis.  The composite stem for a prosthesis, particularly a hip prosthesis, includes a metal core and a fiber reinforced composite shell surrounding the core to provide\nmodulus values that are similar to bone.  The composite shell is composed of braided high tensile strength fibers and a bio-compatible thermoplastic resin having substantially equal strength in all directions i.e. isotropic.  The shell comprises between\n40 and 75 weight percent fiber and 25 to 60 weight percent resin.  The stiffness of the prosthesis can be varied along the length of the stem.  The metal core contributes to between 5 and 25 percent of the total flexural stiffness of the stem.  The\ncomposite prosthesis is said to minimize the modulus mismatch of the stem portion of the component with the cortical shell of the femur.  In use, the stiffness of the inner member (prosthesis) of the femur-prosthesis combination is said to be minimized;\nthis forces the outer member (cortical shell) to carry a greater portion of the load and react closer to the normal physiological manner thereby reducing the problem of bone resorption.  The composite prosthesis disclosed by the \'492 patent comprises a\nmetal core, fiber reinforced isotropic polymeric composite shell.  The modulus of the composite shell is adjusted to be nearly equal to that of natural bone tissue.  There is no bond between the polymeric composite shell and the metal core.  Therefore, a\nseparation may occur between the polymeric shell and the metal core, even when the composite shell attaches to bone tissue.  Therefore, it is not clear how the metal provides any load bearing support.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,316,550 to Forte discloses a prosthesis having a flexible intramedullary stem.  The metallic prosthesis implant for a hip or other joint has an intramedullary stem that has flexibility.  Bending and torsional deformation under\nthe influence of active load forces are comparable to that of the surrounding bone.  The stem has a tapered bore that longitudinally extends from the proximal end to the distal end.  In a second embodiment, the stem has a slit, the width of which also\ntapers from the proximal end to the distal end providing flexibility to the stem.  This flexibility therefore distributes the loading forces from the joint more uniformly over the supporting cortical bone with the result that bone degeneration from\nstress shielding is minimized or eliminated.  The stem of the flexible intramedullary stem has a taped bore providing progressively decreasing stem wall thickness from the proximal and distal end.  In a second embodiment a slit is also provided which has\na varying width in one side of the wall of the stem with a tapered bore.  Both these features provide flexibility to the stem.  The decreased wall thickness of the stem at the distal end may result in buckling or collapse of the stem during torsional or\nbending deformation.  The presence of slit complicates the deformation behavior since the slit can open out under load.  In any case, the modulus of the metallic stem member is essentially the same as the metal, and any bone contacting the metal surface\nis subject to shear separation.  The configuration of the tapered bore and slits is said to improve the bending and torsional deformation of the stem when loaded.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,443,512 to Parr et al. discloses an orthopaedic implant device.  The orthopaedic implant device is formed from a combination of different materials.  It includes a body metal component and a porous metal surface layer for\nintimate contact with bone.  Also included is a polymer in the form of a casing that includes adhesive characteristics for attachment to the body metal component and the porous metal layer.  The body is a metal made from cobalt chrome and the porous\nmetal surface layer is made from titanium.  The preferred polymer casing is polyaryletherketone.  This polymer manifests aggressive adhesive characteristics to the metallic surface of the cobalt chrome and the titanium following transformation to a\nheated state.  The orthopaedic implant device contains a titanium metal core to which a porous layer is secured using PAEK polymeric adhesive.  Such adhesive is said to produce a strong bond between the titanium core and the titanium porous layer.  There\nis no disclosure relating to the elastic modulus of the porous layer infiltrated with a PAEK polymer.  The elastic modulus of the porous layer is expected to be high and anisotropic due to the orientation of the titanium fibers in the porous body and its\nbond to a polymer.  Therefore, its contact with bone tissue will result in shear separation at the interface.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,514,184 to Doi et al. discloses an artificial joint having a porous portion.  The total hip replacement type artificial joint comprises a stem and a socket.  The stem is provided with a head at the upper end and comprises a\nporous portion as an upper portion.  A protector is located under the porous portion at the same height as the porous surface of the porous portion.  An intermediate portion, which underlies the porous portion, has a trapezoidal cross section.  A lower\nportion, which underlies the intermediate portion, has a circular cross section.  The protector is provided along the peripheral edge of the outer cup and at the same height as a porous surface of the cup.  Such arrangement is said to prevent drop-out of\nthe particles from the porous surfaces at the time of insertion into bones of a living body and permit the joint to bear the patient\'s weight imposed after an operation.  A porous portion protector is provided at the same surface level as the porous\nportion to capture any particles that may drop off from the porous portion when the artificial hip joint is inserted into a surgically prepared bone cavity.  There is no means provided to provide a bone-compliant joint since all the materials used for\nthe artificial hip joint are very high modulus metallic materials.  Since the disclosure anticipates the drop out of the particles from the porous coating, the particles are not metallurgically bonded to the stem and the coating is thin, not a thick\ncoating capable of grading the modulus.  The assembly of particles provide no elastic modulus representing load carrying capability, since they fall apart easily.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,591,233 to Kelman et al. discloses metal/composite hybrid orthopedic implants.  The hybrid implant comprises an intraosseous metal portion and an intraosseous composite portion.  The composite portion is comprised of filaments\nnonlinearly disposed within a polymer matrix to produce a structure of variable modulus along its length.  The composite portions may be secured to the metal portion by a taper lock, an adhesive joint, or a shrink fit joint.  This metal/composite hybrid\northopedic implant comprises an intraosseous metal portion and an intraosseous composite portion.  The composite portion is comprised of filaments nonlinearly disposed within a polymer matrix to produce a structure of variable modulus along its length. \nNeither the metallic portion nor the composite portion with fibers in a polymeric matrix have elastic modulus similar to that of natural bone.  Besides, the fibers in the composite portion are longitudinally oriented and as result the elastic modulus\nvaries as a function of direction.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,733,338 to Kampner discloses an implant having a reinforced resorbable stem.  A prosthetic implant for a bone joint has an anchor formed of a resorbable sleeve reinforced with a nonresorbable core.  Initially, the resorbable\nlayer gives secure anchorage of the stem with an interference fit equivalent to that obtainable with the current state of the art in prosthetic joint replacement.  Selected surface portions of the permanent implant component are porous to permit and\ndirect bony attachment.  After an optimal period of time elapses to permit sufficient bony attachment around the permanent, porous implant component, the polymer surrounding the metal core of the anchor slowly degrades and ultimately disappears.  As a\nresult, only the small diameter nonresorbable core remains in the medullary cavity of the bone.  Although a small diameter core remains permanently within the medullary canal, no load bearing occurs through that core because it is spaced apart from\ncortical bone and, therefore, does not come in contact with the surrounding cortical bone structure.  The core becomes essentially nonfunctional and the bone does not "realize" that any stem is actually present.  In biomechanical terms only the permanent\nimplant component forming the articulating surface of the joint remains as a permanent functional component and it is the only artificial component across which stresses are being transferred.  Thus, the \'338 disclosure provides an implant with an anchor\nincluding a nonresorbable core surrounded by a resorbable sleeve.  The implant has a central non-absorbable metallic core surrounded by an anchor made from resorbable material.  The anchor creates an interference fit between the implant and the bone\ncavity and slowly disintegrates as the bone ingrowth occurs.  At this point, the central metallic core becomes detached and no longer carries any load allowing the bone ingrowth to carry all the loading.  This method creates a dangerous situation when\nthe implant is first incorporated since the metallic core is not in any manner attached to the anchor.  Moreover, the ingrowth of the bone into the anchor progressively destroys the integrity of the resorbable layer, and the bone structure is yet to be\nbuilt completely for load sharing.  The presence of a non-load carrying metallic core reduces the overall cross section of the bone reducing its load capacity.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,935,172 to Ochoa et al. discloses a prosthesis having a variable fit and strain distribution.  The joint prosthesis comprises a metallic body having a plurality of negative surface features such as through-slots, deep grooves,\ntunnels or pits, or valleys defined between projecting fingers or flutes.  The metallic body constitutes the structural component of the prosthesis, such as a shell, plate or stem.  A second bio-absorbable component filling at least some of the negative\nsurface feature attaches to and extends the body to provide both a fit and a change in the initial stiffness.  The bio-absorbable component protrudes from an external surface of the femoral stem by a distance of about 0.001 inches to 0.250 inches.  The\nsecond part provides a time-evolving structural coupling, such that the prosthesis initially fits the patient\'s remnant bone to provide rigid fixation, while the mechanical properties shift with time in vivo to change its contact or loading\ncharacteristics.  The femoral stem joint prosthesis may be modular and the first, or structural component, accommodates bio-absorbable second components of varying geometries and dimensions which fit a range of bore sizes, and achieve different\nstiffnesses or strengths affecting load or strain distribution.  This prosthesis with variable fit and strain distribution is a two-part prosthesis.  A first part of the prosthesis is made of bio-compatible metal, which is the metallic support member.  A\nsecond sleeve inserted over the first member is made of biosorbable material.  The tip of the prosthesis is produced as a series of separated spikes with the biosorbable material wedged therebetween.  As the bone grows into this distal region, the\nreduced stiffness at the distal end is realized.  Therefore, the prosthesis is initially tight fitting and becomes more stiffness friendly as the biosorbable material is absorbed by the growing bone.  There is no reduction in modulus incompatibility of\nthe bone with the prosthesis when it is implanted; rather a large time needs to be spent before the biosorbable distal end of the implant is absorbed.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,228,123 to Dezzani discloses a variable modulus prosthetic hip stem.  The variable modulus prosthetic hip stem is insertable in an intramedullary cavity to support an articulation component, which includes a proximal neck\nportion and a distal root portion.  The proximal neck is solid compatible metal such as titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel and extends for a length effective to reach into the cavity and couple to surrounding bone for load bearing engagement. \nThe distal root portion includes a stranded cable of 10 mil cross section wires, which fills the bone cavity but flexes to avoid significant transfer of bending stresses.  The cable is tightly bunched at its junction with the neck, providing a\ntransitional degree of stiffness to its distal part, which is significantly more flexible and bends to accommodate natural displacement of the surrounding bone.  The prosthesis has a section modulus characterized by three distinct regions.  The proximal\nend region has the largest cross section and presents a stiff modulus of solid material, while the distal region is composed of strands and presents a flexible bending stiffness.  An intermediate region of relatively short length where the cable attaches\nto the upper portion has a bending modulus that changes quickly from fairly stiff to flexible.  The location of this portion may be varied by changing the relative lengths of the proximal solid and distal cable portions thus determining or limiting to a\nsmall local region the area of bone which may experience any stress shielding.  The stiffness of the cable may also be varied by use of different gauge wires or the addition of welds or circumferential bands.  In this variable modulus prosthesis hip stem\nthe stiffness at the proximal end is high compared to natural bone and acts as a load-bearing member.  The stiffness at the distal end is low compared to natural bone, allowing the natural bone to participate in bone support.  The variable modulus\nprosthetic hip stem does not have similar modulus or stiffness to a natural bone at any section of the prosthetic hip stem, but merely supports loads locally at different locations along the length of the hip stem.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,312,473 to Oshida discloses an orthopedic implant system.  This orthopedic implant system satisfies the biological, mechanical and morphological compatibility needs.  A solid metal femoral stem and a solid metal acetabular head\nare at least partially covered with diffusion-bonded foamed-shaped sheet made of commercially pure titanium or titanium alloy(s).  The open-cells in said foamed metal sheet are impregnated with biocompatible polymethyl methacrylate resin cement, which is\nreinforced with selected oxides including alumina, magnesia, zirconia, or a combination of these oxides along with an application of a small amount of a metal primer agent.  This disclosure mainly covers an aluminum foam, which is available and projects\nproperties of a titanium foam, which is said to be currently unavailable.  The disclosure projects the strength, and the modulus of elasticity of the foam layer would be less than that of a bone and would require reinforcement by a biocompatible polymer\nsuch as PMMA.  Since the foam is projected to be the weakest element, the orthopedic implant is not securely attached to the bone structure even when bone ingrowth occurs within the bone.  Therefore, the orthopedic implant will experience movement under\nload, creating a dangerous situation.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,656,226 to Yoon discloses a plastic jacket for a cementless artificial joint stem and artificial joint having the jacket.  The artificial joint pivotally connects a first bone to a second bone.  A hole is formed in the second\nbone into which the artificial joint is inserted.  The artificial joint comprises a head that connects with the first bone, a stem of a longitudinal length to fit into the hole of the second bone, a neck connecting the head to the stem and a jacket\nenclosing the stem.  The jacket comprises an outer surface and a porous body.  The body is inserted into the hole of the second bone so that substantially the entire outer surface of the jacket is in direct contact with inner walls of the hole.  The\njacket has a blind opening that receives most of the stem.  The body of the jacket comprises a plastic material, and the outer surface of the body is rough, such that the jacket is adapted to adhere to the second bone by natural growth of the second bone\nonto the outer surface of the jacket without use of cement between the outer surface of the jacket and the inner walls of the second bone.  This cementless artificial joint implant has a porous or rough plastic jacket, which slides over the metallic stem\nand is inserted into a hole in the second bone.  The bone tissue is expected to grow into the rough porous external surface of the plastic jacket.  Thus, the plastic with bone ingrowth may be retained by the bone tissue in time, but there is no\nattachment between the metallic stem and the plastic jacket, as a result, the overall cementless fixation only relies on the friction between the plastic jacket and the metallic stem for implant integrity.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,887,278 to Lewallen discloses a prosthetic implant having a segmented flexible stem exhibiting varying stiffness.  The stem comprises an elongated core and segments extending outward from the core.  The segments are spaced\napart so as to define transverse grooves surrounding the core between adjacent segments.  The longitudinal length of the grooves, and the microstructurally consistent implant materials used for the core and the segments are selected such that the\nstiffness of the stem varies from the proximal end to the distal end.  Typically, the stiffness of the stem will be lower at the distal end such that the distal end of the stem bears less force when loaded and thereby transfers more load to the proximal\nend of the stem, which has a higher stiffness.  As a result, stress shielding the load carried by the implant bypasses the proximal end of the stem and minimizes bone resorption adjacent the proximal end of the stem.  It is therefore an advantage of the\nprosthetic implant is to provide a fixation stem with reduced or varying stiffness such that the stress shielding problems associated with the high mechanical stiffness of the stem can be minimized.  In this segmented flexible stem the central core of\nthe femur implant is provided with a series of tubular sections, which result in segments that are separated by a groove.  The grooves reduce the stiffness of the femur implant.  Optionally, the femur implant may be coated with a porous metallic layer to\nenhance bone bonding properties.  In spite of the presence of segments and grooves, the overall stiffness of the femur implant is still very high compared to the stiffness of a bone tissue.  In addition, the presence of grooves decreases the load\ncarrying capacity of the femoral implant.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,913,623 to Zhu discloses a two-piece fused femoral hip stem.  The two-piece femoral stem orthopedic implant includes a metal core having a first end, a second end, a first elastic modulus, and a first porosity.  A proximal body\nis fused directly onto the metal core between the first and second ends.  The proximal body has a second elastic modulus, which is less than the first elastic modulus, and a second porosity, which is greater than the first porosity.  The porosity of the\nproximal body may vary throughout.  The orthopedic implant minimizes the elastic modulus mismatch between the femoral stem and the surrounding bone material.  To this end, a metal core has a first end, a second end, and a first elastic modulus.  The\nmetal core has a proximal body between the first end and the second end, the proximal body has a second elastic modulus which is less than the first elastic modulus.  In this two-piece fused femoral stem the proximal porous body is said to have a lower\nelastic modulus and contacts the surrounding bone only in the proximal portion of the implant.  In the distal end of the metallic core, no porous body is provided and therefore, there is direct contact between metal core and bone tissue.  This\nsignificant mismatch in elastic modulus at the distal section takes away any benefit of reduced elastic modulus at the porous proximal section.  This implantable prosthesis uses a metallic core with an inserted polymeric proximal body having elastic\nmodulus similar to bone tissue.  However, the bond between the polymeric proximal body and the metallic core may be inadequate to produce a successful orthopedic implant.\n There remains a need in the art for femoral stems for canines or humans that are compliant with the stiffness and elastic modulus of bone tissue so that load is transferred between the bone and the implant without creation of bone separation or\ncrack formation.  When stiffness mismatch is present, the same load carried elongates the implant member differently than the bone tissue resulting in crack formation or implant separation.  Needed in the art is a compliant elastic stiffness or modulus\nfemoral stem for canines or humans that will provide load transfer without crack formation from the initial time period immediately after implant surgery to complete healing of implanted tissue by bone ingrowth.  It would be particularly advantageous if,\ndue to the intimate contact between the prepared bone and the bone compliant femoral stem during the healing period, a long term permanent bond between the implant and the underlying bone structure could be made possible, so that extended motion meeting\nthe needs of a dog could be provided.  It would also be advantageous if the implanted device were to function without corrosion or rejection reactions throughout the lifetime of the dog or human patient, since the implanted device is permanently placed\nwithin the bone structure.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a canine femoral stem that is compliant with the stiffness and elastic modulus of bone tissue, so that load is transferred between the bone and the implant without creation of bone separation or crack formation. \nThe compliant elastic stiffness or modulus of the canine femoral stem provides load transfer without crack formation from the initial time period immediately after implant surgery to complete healing of implanted tissue by bone ingrowth.  Due to the\nintimate contact between the prepared bone and the bone compliant canine femoral stem during the healing period, a long term permanent bond between the implant and the underlying bone structure is made possible, so that extended motion meeting the needs\nof a dog is provided.  Once implanted, the device functions without corrosion or rejection reactions throughout the lifetime of the dog.\n In one aspect, the bone-compliant canine femoral stem has external surfaces that are compatible with natural bone with respect to biocompatibility and elastic modulus.  The external bone contacting surfaces of the canine femoral stem have a\nmodulus substantially similar to that of a natural bone.  The external surface of the bone-compliant femoral stem uses a biocompatible titanium core, having a thick porous titanium surface on the upper portion and a bioresorbable polymeric or calcium\ntriglyceride bone cement material.\n Generally stated, the bone-compliant canine femoral stem comprises: (i) a titanium core, (ii) a substantially thick fully-porous proximal titanium body, and (iii) a distal section of a bioresorbable material with a modulus close to that of\ncancellous bone.  The Femoral Stem addresses the issues of stress mismatch by providing materials in different proportions within the construct which result in a modulus for the stem at the bone contacting interface that is closer to the modulus of the\nproximal and distal femur.  This objective is achieved through implant geometry and material selection.\n The Femoral Stem incorporates a titanium core (could also be cobalt chrome or another biocompatible metal), a proximal titanium body, which is fully porous and thick, and a distal section of a bioresorbable material with a modulus close to\ncancellous bone.  The proximal body, which is fully porous, provides the appropriate pore sizes to allow for bone ingrowth.  Because of its fully porous nature and the layer thickness of 0.080 to 0.120 inches, the proximal body yields under low load and\ncreates a modulus that is similar to a bone tissue.  This thickness geometry in combination with porous titanium material cooperate to bring the modulus of the porous titanium in contact with the bone tissue to a modulus closer to that of bone.  The\nbiocompatible porous metallic body is composed of sintered beads of metal, including titanium, titanium alloy or chromium alloy.  The porous metallic body may also be made from titanium fiber metal.\n Our present invention provides a bone-compliant canine femoral stem, which is characterized by having modulus at the bone-contacting surface matching that of the natural bone, enabling load transfer without formation of cracks at the interface. \nThe low modulus in the bone contact region of the upper portion of the canine femoral stem is formed by a thick titanium porous body diffusion bonded or mechanically attached to a central solid metallic core body.  This low modulus is due to inclusion of\nmultiple levels of porosity, which results in large movement at low loads or an effective elastic modulus, which is small.  At the region of the porous body which contacts the titanium central core, the modulus is lesser than that of titanium, but is\nmuch larger than that of the porous body at the bone contacting region.  The modulus falls rapidly in a progressively decreasing fashion along the thickness of the porous titanium body as a function of distance from the titanium central core.\n In the lower portion of the bone-complaint canine femoral stem, a thick low modulus biosorbable contact region is provided that is manufactured by compression molding of biocompliant polymer such as PEEK or calcium triglyceride bone cement over\nthe central solid metallic core.  The modulus of the biocompatible polymer or the calcium triglyceride bone cement is naturally similar to that of bone tissue and therefore no porosity is needed to be bone-compatible.\n When the bone compliant canine femoral stem is inserted into a surgically prepared bone cavity, the lower portion of the bone compliant femoral stem is firmly fitted into the cavity providing initial stability immediately after surgery.  The\nbone ingrowth occurs both in the lower and upper portion of the bone-complaint canine femoral stem since the overall elastic modulus of the diffusion bonded or mechanically attached porous body and the compression or injection molded lower portion is\nvery similar to the bone tissue.  The load is therefore transferred from the central solid metallic core to the bone tissue without creating delamination or crack formation at the bone contacting regions of the bone-compliant canine femoral stem.\n The bone-compliant canine femoral stem is manufactured by using one of several processes.  In a first process, there is selected a central titanium core, which is slender and tapered.  The slender titanium core is reinforced and rigidized by\nhaving flanges extending along its length to provide a cross section that is similar to a double L beam.  This structure is light and yet supports bending loads effectively.  A separate porous titanium body matching the shape of the titanium central core\nis formed by diffusion bonding of titanium beads.  This porous titanium body may have sufficient length to cover the entire length of the titanium central core or may be of a length sufficient to cover only the proximal portion of the bone-compliant\ncanine femoral stem.  In a next step of the process, the titanium porous sintered body is metallurgically bonded to the titanium central core by diffusion bonding.\n The distal portion of the bone-compliant femoral stem which may be covered with a porous titanium body or which may be bare titanium core is compression or injection molded with a bio-compatible polymer such as PEEK.  This may be done by direct\ncompression or injection molding of the polymeric body or first molding the polymeric body separately and heating it to compression or injection mold the polymeric body over the distal portion of the bone compatible canine femoral stem.  Alternately, a\nbone-compatible calcium triglyceride bone cement may be used to coat a thick layer over the bare or porous titanium body covered titanium core at the distal portion of the bone-compliant canine femoral stem.

The bone-compliant femoral stem is herein described with particular reference to use in canines.  However, it will\nbe understood that the principles of the invention are fully applicable to use of the femoral stem in humans.  The bone-compliant canine femoral stem comprises a slender biocompatible metallic support member made from a Ti alloy, preferably Ti--Al--V\nalloy or a chromium alloy.  The dimensions of the slender metallic body are generally much less than the surgically prepared bone cavity and are of a size sufficient to withstand the stresses provided by a canine patient immediately after a surgical\nprocedure.  The slender metallic support member is completely surrounded in the proximal and distal region by a porous biocompatible member, preferably a titanium member, which is diffusion bonded or mechanically attached to the slender metallic support\nmember.  This diffusion bonding results in metallurgical permanent bonding of the porous metallic member to the metallic supporting member.  In traumas involving fractures of bone and in osteotomies of bone, in order to re-orient alignment between bone\nsegments, bone plates and screws have been used for many decades.  They are used at the fracture/osteotomy site to stabilize the segments of bone and to allow the normal healing process to take place.  Stabilizing the bone segments is critical to the\nhealing process in order to avoid non-union that can be caused by micro motion between the bone segments.\n Typically titanium and its alloys have an elastic modulus of 110 GPa and cobalt chromium alloys have an elastic modulus of 205 GPa while a cortical bone has a modulus of 15 GPa.  A cancellous bone has a modulus of only 0.8 GPA.  As a result,\nboth titanium alloy and cobalt chromium alloys have a modulus that far exceeds the modulus of the bone with which the metallic support member is supposed to bond.  When a load is applied to the bonded bone and to a metallic object, the load is primarily\nborne by the metallic member and creates a minimal deflection.  On the other hand, the bone tissue takes a very small amount of load and is extended to the same strain value or displacement.  This gross difference in elastic modulus results in shear\nforces at the bone-metallic object interface causing separation and delamination at this interface, which interferes with the bone healing process and attachment of the bone to the metallic object.  A porous metallic structure, depending on how it is\nmade, has an elastic modulus in the range of 3.5 GPa to 8 GPa which is closer to the modulus of the bone than the titanium alloys or cobalt chromium alloys.  The titanium alloy or the cobalt chromium alloy is diffusion bonded or mechanically attached to\nthe porous metallic medium.  Since this bond is a metallurgical bond, the elastic modulus decreases rapidly as a function of distance from the porous metal medium-metallic support medium interface along the porous metallic medium.  Within a very short\ndistance, typically 50 to 100 microns the modulus approaches the native elastic modulus value of the unattached porous metallic medium.  The porous metallic medium is provided at such a thickness that the modulus of the porous metallic medium is close to\nits native value, which is very close to the modulus of a native bone.  Therefore, when the canine femoral member is subjected to load, the metallic support member supports most of the load, and extends its length with a specific strain value according\nto the high elastic modulus.  The metallurgically attached porous metallic member extends to the same extent and the same strain level and load shared by the porous metallic member is only equal to the strain multiplied by the porous metallic member\'s\nelastic modulus.  Since the elastic modulus decreases rapidly as a function of distance from the metallic support member within the porous metallic member, the load carried also decreases rapidly.  At the bone-contacting surface of the porous metallic\nmember, which is further away from the interface with the metallic support member, the same strain results in a much smaller load.  As a result, bone ingrowth can occur without the possibility of delamination.\n FIG. 1 illustrates at 10 an illustration of the prior art traditional canine femoral stem made from cobalt chromium alloy.  The porous surface coating is applied only to the proximal body portion of the stem as shown at 11.  The porous portion\nis built by sintering of layers of beads of cobalt chromium or titanium to a depth of only 0.030 inches.  The distal portion of the stem shown at 12 is a solid non-porous stem, typically a cobalt-chromium alloy.  The porous body made from sintered beads\nis not compliant due to its small thickness and cannot function by crushing to provide intimate contact with a surgically prepared bone cavity.  The thickness of this layer is insufficient to reduce the high modulus of the cobalt chromium stem at the\nbone-contacting interface.  There is no porous coating at the distal end to facilitate bone ingrowth.\n FIG. 2 illustrates the design features of a bone-compliant canine femoral stem generally shown at 20.  The bone-compliant canine femoral stem has a body area or metaphysical area A, a distal area or diaphysical area B and a neck area C. The\nbone-compliant canine femoral stem has a titanium alloy or cobalt chromium metallic support core 21, over which a fully porous titanium body 22 is diffusion bonded or mechanically attached.  The diffusion bonded or mechanically attached porous metallic\nmember extends and covers the metaphysical area A and disphysical area B. The disphysical area B is coated with a biosorbable material 23.  The titanium core as shown at 24 is a one-piece metallic support core which extends from the neck portion to the\nbody and distal portion.\n FIG. 3a illustrates at 30 the cross section and relative dimensions of the bone-compliant canine femoral stem along XX of FIG. 2.  The cross section shows the yellow colored metal (titanium) supporting core at 31 marked as X and the green\ncolored porous metallic (titanium) body marked as Y at 32.  The thickness of the porous metallic body has a thickness of at least 0.080 inches, a dimension comparable to the titanium core dimension.  The orange colored region is the typical bone ingrowth\nregion.  The FIG. 3b diagrammatically shows in the insert figure illustrating the elastic modulus as a function of distance from the central titanium central core interface.\n FIGS. 4a through 4h illustrate the various components of the bone-compliant canine femoral stem and its manufacturing process.  FIG. 4a shows the front view of the solid titanium metal core shown in yellow color.  FIG. 4b shows its side view\nindicating its complex geometry.  FIG. 4c shows in green the sintered porous titanium alloy body constructed by diffusion bonding of spheres of titanium.  It has a central aperture as shown.  FIG. 4d shows the front view of the porous titanium body while\nFIG. 4e shows its side view.  FIG. 4f shows in blue a biocompatible polymeric body with a central aperture.  FIG. 4g shows the front view of the biocompatible polymeric body.  FIG. 4h exemplifies the method of assembly of the bone-compliant canine\nfemoral stem.  The sintered porous titanium body 4b is slipped over the central solid core 4a and diffusion bonded in a furnace or mechanically attached to create a metallurgical bond between the porous titanium body and the solid metallic core.  The\nsintered component is cooled and the molded polymeric component 4g is slipped over the distal end and is subjected to compression molding.  The bone-compliant canine femoral stem thus produced is illustrated in 4h.\n In an alternate embodiment, the porous titanium body may be sintered to the central titanium core directly by diffusion bonding or sintering.  The distal portion of the central titanium core may be molded with bio-compatible polymer such as PEEK\nby compression molding or injection molding.  As an alternate, the distal portion may be provided with a thick coating of calcium triglyceride bone cement, which is inherently porous.\n The salient features of the Bone-Compliant Canine Femoral Stem include: 1.  a slender titanium core having a proximal geometry (neck) allowing for the attachment of a femoral head; 2.  the slender titanium core having a taper from the neck area\ninto a curved conical area providing strength for hip biomechanics and being of sufficient size to have a proximal body added; 3.  the slender titanium core having a thick porous titanium metal body diffusion bonded or mechanically attached throughout\nsubstantially its entire or proximal length; 4.  the diffusion bonding creating permanent metallurgical attachment between the titanium core and the porous metallic body; 5.  the porous metallic body having an elastic modulus and mechanical properties\nsimilar to a natural bone and the diffusion bond gradually decrementing the elastic modulus of the titanium core to that of the porous metallic body from the titanium core-porous metallic body interface and reaching the native elastic modulus of the\nporous metallic body within a very short distance along the thickness from the interface; 6.  the thick porous metallic body when it makes contact with a bone tissue providing a bone-complaint contact with the bone since the elastic modulus has been\ndecremented sufficiently due to the thickness of the porous metallic body; 7.  the distal section of the slender titanium core with or without the thick porous titanium body is coated with and by a moldable biosorbable polymer or ceramic coating; 8.  the\nproximal portion of the canine femoral stem comprising a thick porous metal body bonded to a slender titanium core press fitting tightly into a surgically prepared bone cavity and providing initial stability in both cemented and cementless surgical\nprocedures; 9.  the biosorbable polymer or ceramic coating in the distal section of the bone-compliant canine femoral stem encouraging bone ingrowth into the porous metallic body surrounding and being bonded to the slender titanium core, thereby\npromoting rapid stability of the implanted canine femoral stem; 10.  the proximal portion of the canine femoral stem that is not coated with moldable biosorbable polymer or ceramic coating experiencing substantial bone ingrowth over time; 11.  the\nslender titanium core with bone ingrown porous metallic body and biosorbable polymer or ceramic coating sharing load carrying capability together with the natural bone; 12.  the bone-compliant canine femoral stem having improved initial fixation and\nproviding more consistent bone ingrowth owing to a stiffness similar to the bone and thereby moving with the bone under physiological loads as opposed to stiffer constructs which would have more relative motion with the bone interfaces due to the\nrelative stiffness mismatch; 13.  a stem design, which allows for the preparation of the canine femoral canal by a sequential broaching method or a combination of tapered reamers and broaches; and 14.  a sufficient number of stem sizes to provide initial\npress fit to a wide range of canine femorae.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art.  For example, the\nporous body can comprise a three-dimensional, porous metal foam manufactured from biocompatible material such as titanium, tantalum, cobalt-chrome, niobium or the like.  Such a piece of foam-metal can have flexural and strength properties compatible with\nthe bone structure.  These modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

 'patent_description': u"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a modular easily assembled tapered or spherical hollow reamer for medical applications having a disposable cutter that includes one or more bone debris capturing cavities; and more particularly, to a hollow\ntapered or spherical reamer having a disposable reamer assembly, which can be attached or detached to a reusable shaft portion using a special tool, wherein the assembly is aided by a guide pin.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  Such procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Reamers are also used in procedures that involve the\ninternal fixation of fractures.  Prior art reamers for reaming internal canal in bones typically use a rigid or a flexible shaft.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer. \nSolid cylindrical or tapered reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper\nfit of the implant.  Conventional reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates\nsufficient friction/heat to damage or kill the surrounding bone.  These prior art solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone\nnecrosis.  Dull blades also incorporate bone debris or bone cement debris into the living bone tissue, creating bone healing problems.  Similar problems are also encountered in reaming a spherical cavity for the attachment of an acetabular cup.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,116,200 to Braun et al. discloses a milling tool for surgical purposes.  The surgical milling tool is a hand-operated milling machine for milling the heads or sockets of bone joints and has a spherical shape.  The tool is\nformed of a hemispherical cup integrally formed with a cylindrical skirt and flange and is provided with a plurality of openings of semi-oval shape, each having a cutting edge arranged at the minor axis of the oval shape.  The openings are situated such\nthat, upon rotation of the cup, the cutting edges thereof overlap to provide a continuous cutting edge surface conforming generally to the shape of the cup.  The hemispherical shape of the cup provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the\nbone joints.  Bone and cartilage shavings are formed during the milling process and are collected in a border area inside of the hemispherical cup.  The surgical milling tool is provided for multiple uses and therefore the tool tends to become less\nefficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  Moreover, the spherically shaped reaming tool is not tapered.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,190,548 to Davis discloses a surgical reamer.  This surgical bone reamer includes a rotatable, elongated shank having a proximal end, a distal end and a longitudinal axis.  A reaming head mounted on the distal end.  A plurality\nof equally spaced walls is radially disposed on the reaming head around the longitudinal axis.  Tip edges for penetrating bone are defined on the radial walls to be disposed angularly with the longitudinal axis.  Reaming edges joined to the tip edges\nextend longitudinally from the tip edges in the proximal direction parallel to and an equal radial distance from the longitudinal axis for reaming a cylindrical tunnel when the reaming head is rotated in bone.  Tapered flutes disposed angularly between\nthe tip edges and the radial walls permit bone to be evacuated through the reaming head when forming a tunnel in bone.  The reaming head is provided with angular tips and edges for penetrating the bone and is thus not a single use disposable cutter.  The\ndebris created is not stored away from the cutting edge and thus previously cut material may be included in the bone.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,549,613 to Goble et al. discloses a modular surgical drill.  This modular surgical drill is in the form of a rigid drill shaft and a drill bit, which are connected together by a tongue-and-groove arrangement attaching the rear\nend of the drill bit to the forward end of the drill shaft.  Each of the shaft and drill bit are provided with through bores extending centrally through their entire length.  These bores become aligned upon assembly of the drill bit and shaft.  The\nmodular drill is intended to be employed with a guidewire for drilling holes into bone.  The assembled drill bit and shaft are placed on the guidewire and moved down such guidewire into contact with the bone, whereupon a tunnel may be formed into the\nbone by rotating and advancing the drill bit along the guidewire.  The dimensions of the bore and guidewire are so selected as to prevent the drill bit and drill shaft from moving relative to one another once they are assembled and mounted on the\nguidewire.  Debris created during drilling is not removed and collected away from the cutting location.  The central bore is solid and as such does not receive cut bone debris.  The cutter used is not disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,556,399 to Huebner discloses a bone-harvesting drill apparatus and method for its use.  A coring drill harvests bone from a donor area of the human body.  The drill bit is formed with a cylindrical, hollow shaft and a\nhalf-conical tip or cutting head.  The cutting head is provided with a sharpened edge, which meets at an apex with a non-sharpened edge, forming an obtuse angle of approximately 120 degrees.  The sharpened edge is configured to cut into bone when the\ndrill bit is rotated in a clockwise direction.  With the apex directed against a section of bone, the cutting edge sheers off fragments of bone, which are then drawn upwardly through the hollow shank of the drill bit.  As the drill bit is forced\ndownwardly, continuous cutting action occurs and the morselized bone can then be removed from the shank and used to build-up bone in other areas to which it is transplanted.  The drill bit fittingly mates on the distal end a fitting that renders the\ndrill bit physically compatible with a conventional chuck.  The bit includes a pair of diametrically opposed, oppositely inclined recesses that cooperate with a crossbar member within a bit-receiving bore of the fitting.  When the aligned drill bit is\npressed into the fitting, the crossbar member cams along the inclined recesses causing the bit to rotate relative to the fitting.  The resulting frictional engagement between the recesses and the crossbar member, along with a detent assembly between the\nbit and the fitting, securely lock the bit onto the distal end of the fitting, yet render removal possible by the use of a removal tool.  The bone harvesting tool provides a non-disposable cutter.  Reuse of the cutter dulls the beveled lip edges. \nMoreover, the harvested bone collection central bore requires a thorough cleaning prior to each use, creating contamination possibilities.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,690,634 to Muller et al. discloses a medullary drill head.  This drill head for intramedullary drilling has a front part, a middle part and a rear part and is shaped as a hollow body of revolution.  The front and rear parts\nhave spiral slots formed with cutting edges.  The rear part has an attachment for coupling to a drilling shaft.  The drill head is not disposable, and as a result, the drill head is continuously reused, resulting in dulling of the cutting edges. \nMoreover, the drill head includes three openings in the form of spirally shaped slots configured to have cutting edges similar to a grater; and has no place to collect bone debris.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,954,671 to O'Neill discloses a bone harvesting method and apparatus.  This apparatus and method harvests bone using a manual, cylindrical, multi-directional coring device with a guided delivery system that can be inserted\nthrough a percutaneous or closed approach to extract precisely measured amounts of bone or bone marrow.  A series of guide wires, obturators, dilators and cannulas are used as the exposure and delivery instrumentation for a cutting tool.  The cutting\ntool has a tip with six cutting edges for cutting in all directions.  This apparatus is a manual, cylindrical, multi-directional coring device with a guided delivery system to extract precisely measured amounts of bone or bone marrow.  The cutter portion\nof the device is not disposable and is subject to wear and dull edges.  This coring device does not suggest a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,976,144 to Fishbein et al. discloses a hollow dome reamer with removable teeth.  This surgical reamer has a hollow dome with apertures spaced apart arranged in arcs extending from an apex of the dome to the base portion of the\ndome, and removable teeth positioned in the apertures.  Each cutting tooth has (i) a flange that is aligned flush with the external surface of the dome, (ii) a raised cutting edge extending above the flange and the external surface of the dome, and (iii)\nan interior passageway communicating between the outside and inside of the dome.  A base plate may be removably secured on the base portion of the dome to provide closure for the central cavity of the dome.  Although the teeth are removable, they are not\ndisposable in nature; the teeth are removed for replacement or for re-sharpening and are used again.  Removal of the small teeth may be cumbersome and difficult, and may even pose a danger during removal as the person removing the teeth may be cut by the\nsharp edges; replacement of the teeth into the apertures of the reamer will likely pose the same problems.  The bone debris is not collected away from the cutting edges of the teeth.  This hollow domed reamer has a spherical shape; does not suggest a\ntapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,980,170 to Salyer discloses a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is secured at one of the shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool\ncollate is secured at the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be positioned.  The boss has a distal end surface with a groove therein.  Both the groove and the\ndistal end surface extend transversely of the axis.  A pin is positioned in the groove on the axis.  A latch mechanism is provided to hold a mounting bar of a rotary tool in the groove on the pin, whereby the rotary tool is held exactly coaxially of the\ndriver during use.  The rotary tool, which is used with the driver has a bar containing the same dimensions as the groove in the boss of the tool driver.  The bar thus fills and is complementary to the slot.  The bar has a hole therein which is\ncomplementary to the pin.  The pin extends coaxially of the shaft and the boss.  The bar hole in which the pin of the tool driver is positioned is precisely coaxial of the axis of the tool about which the cutting edges are precisely positioned.  The\ncutters are connected to the tip of the shaft and are spherical in nature for joint and patella reaming.  In addition, the reamer cups are not disposable in nature.  The bone fragments are not collected and kept away from the cutting edge.  This\nspherically shaped reamer is not tapered.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,193,722 to Zech et al. discloses a hollow milling tool.  The hollow milling tool produces substantially hollow cylindrical depressions in human or animal tissue.  It also produces tissue pillars, which are removed at a harvest\nlocation, transported to a defect location and implanted.  The hollow milling tool has teeth for the ablation of tissue which are arranged at the distal end of the milling tool at the end side.  Furthermore, the milling tool has passages for transporting\na cooling fluid to a cooling region of the milling tool lying near the distal end during the ablation of tissue.  Teeth are constructed within the milling tool for accomplishing the depressions.  These teeth will eventually need sharpening as the tool is\nused over time.  No structure is contained within the '722 patent that discloses or suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,332,886 to Green et al. discloses a surgical reamer and method of using same.  This device is used for expedited reaming of a medullary canal.  The device includes a reamer head connected at the distal end of a rotatable drive\nshaft.  The reamer head has a cutting head with five blades and flutes therebetween.  Each blade has a front cutting portion.  The blades can also include a side cutting portion.  The method for removing material from the medullary canal of a bone\nincludes the steps of reaming an area of the medullary canal to remove material; irrigating the material to be removed while reaming to reduce generation of heat and move removed material from the reaming area; and aspirating the removed material while\nreaming to create a negative intramedullary canal pressure to assist in the removal of the material.  The blades and flutes at the reamer are reused and are subject to dulling.  The bone chips are to be removed by the irrigating fluid, which means they\nare always present adjacent to the cutting portions and may be forced into the bone tissue.  No disclosure in the '886 patent suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,451,023 to Salazar et al. discloses a guide bushing for a coring reamer, storage package for reamer assembly, and method of use.  This guide bushing for a coring reamer has a tapered member with its largest diameter at its\nfirst end so that the guide bushing frictionally engages an internal surface of the reamer with a line contact.  The guide bushing has a passage sized to slidably receive a guide pin.  In use, the bushing advances in the proximal direction within the\ncoring reamer along a guide pin while the excavated bone enters the passageway through the reamer.  A storage package specifically designed for the reamer assembly is employed to remove the excavated bone from within the reamer.  The package has a closed\ndistal end and an open proximal end closeable with a cap.  With the coring reamer received in cantilevered fashion through a central opening of the cap of the tube, and with an adapter that couples the coring reamer to a handpiece installed, a wrench is\nplaced over the adapter and turned while the user grips peripheral surfaces of the cap to prevent rotation of the coring reamer.  A plunger is inserted through the opening and through the coring reamer from the proximal end.  The plunger is pushed\nthrough the reamer until the bone core and bushing fall out of the distal end of the coring reamer.  The guide bushing for a coring reamer is appointed with an open end surrounded by peripheral teeth.  The teeth are arranged peripheral to the body of the\ntube of the reamer.  The tube is hollow and therefore excavated bone accumulates therewithin.  The reamer, bushing and packaging are disposed of after use.  The '023 patent discloses a bone excavating tool that does not prepare the bone canal for\nimplantation of femoral implants.  No structure is disclosed therein that suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,074,224 to Daniels et al. discloses a modular tapered reamer for bone preparation and associated method.  This kit is for use in performing joint arthroplasty and includes a trial and a reamer.  The reamer is said to be useful\nwhen preparing a cavity in the intramedullary canal of a long bone with the use of a driver, and to assist in performing a trial reduction.  The reamer includes a first portion for placement at least partially in the cavity of the long bone and a second\nportion operably connected to the first portion.  The reamer is removably connected to the driver to rotate the reamer.  The trial is removably attachable to the reamer.  This tapered reamer is not disposable and does not have provision for accumulating\nbone debris away from the cutting portion of the bone.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0113836 to Lozier et al. discloses an expandable reamer.  This expandable reamer includes a cannulated shaft and a plurality of straight cutting blades having deformable points.  The blades are\nhingably outwardly rotatable at the deformation points between a contracted position and an expanded position.  In the contracted position, the blades are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cannulated shaft and, in the expanded\nposition, the blades have at least a portion oriented radially outward from the longitudinal axis, thereby forming a larger diameter cutting surface in the expanded position and in the contracted position.  The blades are formed from a portion of the\ncannulated shaft by, e.g. milling longitudinally extending slots through the wall of the cannulated shaft.  The slots serve as flutes dividing the cutting edge and trailing edge of each adjacent blade.  Each blade may also include more than one segment\narranged along its length, the segments being coupled by deformation points.  The expandable reamer may be used for cutting a cavity in a bone or other structure that is larger than the diameter of the entry point into the bone and greater than the\ndiameter of the contracted reamer.  The expandable reamer is not disposable.  Since the expandable blades are deformably attached to the cannulated shaft, the cut bone debris is not collected away from the bone cutting region.  As a result, fragments of\ncut bone debris may be pushed into the bone tissue by the deformable rotating blades.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0004371 to Williams et al. discloses an orthopedic reamer.  This orthopedic reamer is for use in creating and sizing canals in a bone.  The orthopedic reamer includes a non-polymeric cutting portion\nhaving at least one cutting surface thereon and a polymeric body portion covering at least a portion of the cutting portion.  The at least one cutting surface is not covered by the polymeric body portion.  The orthopedic reamer provides cutting\ncomponents including a blade or saw like construction, rather than the plurality of teeth.  Although the orthopedic reamer is appointed for disposability, the publication requires that the entire reamer, and not just the cutting portion, be disposed of. \nThat is to say, the entire reamer, including the non-polymeric cutting portion and the polymeric body portion of the device are all disposed of; not just the cutter.\n There remains a need in the art for a low cost modular easily assembled hollow tapered or spherical reamer for medical applications having a disposable hollow cutter assembly.  Also needed in the art is a disposable hollow cutter assembly of the\ntype described, which can be attached to a reusable shaft portion that provides means for reaming of the internal canal of bones or hemi-spherical bone cavities.  Further needed in the art is a cutter assembly having means for collecting bone debris,\nthereby reducing heat build up by friction effects at the bone-cutter interface and keeping the collected debris displaced from the cutting edges, so that after one use of the reamer a new hollow cutter assembly can be utilized and the old hollow cutter\nassembly can be discarded.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a low cost, modular, easily assembled hollow tapered or spherical reamer that has a space for bone debris collection for medical applications and has a disposable cutter assembly.  The cutter assembly is attached\nto a reusable shaft portion assisted by a guide pin using a special attachment tool.\n The first group of embodiments of the invention relates to the attachment of a tapered hollow reamer to a reusable shaft using a special tool to precisely align the centerline of the shaft with that of the tapered hollow reamer assisted by a\nguide pin.  The hollow reamer has its distal end permanently connected to a pilot provided with a central aperture for the insertion of guide pin during assembly.  This central aperture may also be used to guide the reamer in a desired reaming direction\nby using a guide pin that is inserted into a bone cavity.  The proximal other end of the reamer has a tapered interior that matches the taper provided on a external surface of a tapered body element provided on the distal end of the reusable shaft. \nThus, when the reusable shaft is inserted and advanced into the reamer during assembly aided by the guide pin, the guide pin centers the reamer with respect to the center line of the shaft while the taper on the external surface of the tapered body\nelement of the shaft engages the interior taper of the reamer, further assuring concentricity of alignment between the shaft and the reamer.\n In a first variant of the first embodiment, the guide pin is barbell shaped.  It connects the tapered hollow reamer pilot to the reusable shaft and is left within the reamer assembly, providing additional strength to the assembled hollow tapered\nreamer.  This left-behind guide pin provides additional flexural strength to the reamer and thus is ideally suited for use in reaming the bone canal in a previously undrilled bone or a non-cannulated application.  The torque transmission between the\nshaft and the reamer is accomplished through one or more torque transmission tabs in the tapered interior of the proximal end of the reamer, engaging with one or more slots present in the tapered body element of the shaft.\n In a second variant of the first embodiment, a cylindrical guide pin is used to connect the tapered hollow reamer pilot to the reusable shaft during assembly.  The cylindrical guide pin is then removed leaving behind a central hole in the\nassembled reamer, which may be advantageously used to guide the reamer in the bone cavity when a guide pin is inserted into the bone at a selected location This second variant of the tapered hollow assembled reamer with a removable cylindrical guide pin\nis most suited for cannulated application, wherein a bone cavity is already present and is commonly used for enlarging a bone cavity or removing previously used adhesive cements in a bone cavity prior to insertion of a fresh bone stem.  The torque\ntransmission between the shaft and the reamer is accomplished through one or more torque transmission tabs in the tapered end of the tapered hollow reamer engaging with one or more slots present in the tapered body element of the shaft similar to the\nfirst variant of the first embodiment discussed above.\n A third variant of the first embodiment uses a guide pin with threading attachment means provided both on the distal end and on the proximal end.  The guide pin distal end has a threaded male end that engages with a threaded aperture provided in\nthe pilot potion of the tapered hollow reamer, assuring concentricity of the reamer with respect to the centerline of the shaft.  The guide pin also has a threaded male member at its proximal end, which engages with corresponding threaded aperture in the\ntapered body element of the reusable shaft.  The threads in the proximal and distal end are similar in thread orientation in that they both tighten when the shaft or guide pin is turned in the same direction.  This assembly may be conveniently\naccomplished by turning the guide pin, first using a socket inserted through the aperture in the pilot securing the pilot of the reamer to the guide pin.  Next, the shaft is turned about its axis to engage the threads of the proximal end of the guide pin\nwith the threads within the central aperture of the shaft tapered body element until the tapered body element snugly contacts the proximal end taper of the reamer further assuring concentricity of the reamer with respect to the centerline of the shaft. \nTorque transmission between the shaft and the reamer is accomplished by the threaded connections between the shaft and the guide pin and between the guide pin and the reamer.  This assembled reamer has the guide pin present within the reamer and thus\nprovides additional flexural strength to the reamer and thus is useful both for non-cannulated and cannulated applications.  A cannulated application requires the guide pin to have a central aperture allowing a guide pin inserted in the bone cavity or\nbone surface to guide the reaming direction.\n The second embodiment of the invention relates to attaching a spherical hollow reamer to a reusable shaft using a special tool precisely aligning the centerline of the shaft with that of the spherical hollow reamer assisted by a guide pin.  This\nguide pin has both distal and proximal ends threaded similar to the third variant of the first embodiment and is used to assemble a spherical hollow reamer with a reusable shaft.  The shaft has a tapered body element that engages a taper present in the\ninterior of the hollow tapered reamer during assembly ensuring concentricity of the spherical hollow reamer with respect to the centerline of the reusable shaft providing wobble-free reaming of a spherical cavity.  The guide pin is not removed and\nprovided additional rigidity to the spherical hollow reamer assembly.  The threads in the distal and proximal ends are similar in thread orientation in that they both tighten when the shaft or the guide pin is turned in the same direction.  This assembly\nmay be conveniently accomplished by first turning the guide pin using a socket inserted through a central aperture of the spherical hollow reamer for engagement of the spherical hollow spherical reamer with guide pin followed by turning the shaft to\nengage the proximal end of the guide pin with the shaft.  Torque transmission between the shaft and the reamer is accomplished by the threaded connections between the shaft and the guide pin and between the guide pin and the reamer.\n The tool for assembling the first embodiment comprises a tool member with a fixed jaw in the distal end and an adjustable jaw in the proximal end, which may be moved by hand pressure application similar to a glue gun.  The hollow tapered reamer\nwith the inserted guide pin of the first and second variant of the first embodiment is placed on the fixed end of the tool member.  The tapered body element central aperture of the shaft is next aligned with the protruding guide pin and one or more\ntorque transmitting tabs are aligned with the corresponding one or more slots of the shaft tapered body element.  The shaft is first pushed in manually followed by forceful displacement of the shaft into reamer until the conical taper of the interior of\nthe reamer engages the conical taper of the tapered body element on the distal end of the shaft.  At this stage, the barbell of the guide pin of the first variant of the first embodiment is seated against the pilot of the reamer.  Now, the adjustable end\nof the tool bends the outer proximal edge of the reamer against the proximal end of the tapered body element of the shaft thereby securing the shaft against the reamer while maintaining the concentricity.  In the case of the second variant of the first\nembodiment, the guide pin is withdrawn from the pilot exposing the central aperture within the reamer which may be used to accept a bone inserted guide pin that guides the reaming direction precisely along a pre-selected path.  The assembly procedure\naccording to third variant of the first embodiment and the second embodiment which attaches a spherical hollow reamer to a reusable shaft using a threaded connection is similar in that the guide pin is turned first using a hex nut in order to bring the\nguide pin within the threaded aperture of the pilot or the central aperture of the spherical reamer.  Next, the shaft is turned on its axis to engage the threads of the proximal end of the guide pin with the threads in the distal end of the central\naperture of the tapered body element of the shaft.  At the same time, the conical taper of the tapered body element of the shaft engages the conical taper of the external surface of the tapered hollow reamer proximal of the third variant of the first\nembodiment or the spherical reamer of the second embodiment.  In both cases, the concentricity of the reamer is maintained by the guide pin and is further assisted by the engagement of the conical taper of the reamer with the tapered body element of the\nshaft.  The torque from the shaft is transmitted to the reamer through the two tightened threaded connections since the direction of rotation of the reamer is in the same direction as that is required for tightening the two threaded attachments.\n The disassembly of the reamer is accomplished by reversing the assembly procedure using the hand tool and the used reamer is discarded since it is intended for one-time use only assuring sharp cutting teeth minimizing heat build up in the one\nthat is being reamed.\n Generally stated, the low cost easy-to-assemble reamer for medical applications comprises: (a) a disposable tapered hollow reamer or a spherical hollow reamer with a pilot permanently attached at its distal end; (b) the pilot having a central\naperture for accepting a guide pin; (c) the proximal end of the tapered hollow reamer or a spherical hollow reamer provided with a tapered central aperture for accepting external taper of a tapered body element of a shaft; (d) a reusable reamer shaft\nhaving an elongated body with a distal end and a proximal end; (e) said distal end of reusable reamer shaft having a tapered body element and a central aperture for accepting a guide pin; (f) a coupling portion appointed for attachment of said reamer\nshaft proximal end to a drilling device; (g) a guide pin aligning the centerline of the reusable shaft and the disposable tapered or spherical hollow reamer during assembly; (h) the tapered external surface of tapered body member of reamer shaft matching\na correspond taper provided in a disposable tapered hollow reamer or a disposable spherical hollow reamer, further precisely aligning the centerline of the reamer with the center line of the shaft during assembly; (i) torque transmission capability\nbetween said shaft and reamer provided by one or more tapered hollow reamer tabs engaging with matching one or more slots provided on the said tapered body element of the shaft or by having threaded attachment of the distal end of the guide pin with\nthreads in the central aperture of the pilot and threaded attachment of proximal end of guide pin with the threads in the central aperture of the tapered body element of the shaft; (j) the bone cement debris or bone shaving produced during reaming\ncollected within the central accumulation space of the tapered or spherical hollow reamer thereby rapidly removing bone cement debris or bone shavings from the cutting surface preventing heat build up at the bone-reamer interface.\n The present invention of easily assembled modular low cost tapered or spherical hollow reamer solves the problems associated with the prior art reamers.  In accordance with the present invention, the low-cost, modular tapered or spherical hollow\nreamer for medical applications is easily assembled and disassembled using a tool that precisely aligns the centerline of the reamer with that of the shaft during assembly, whereby the hollow reamer is attached to a reusable shaft assisted by a guide\npin.  Once assembled, the low cost modular tapered or spherical hollow reamer of the present invention transfers shaft torque reliably to the reamer while at the same time maintains the centerline of the reamer, preventing wobbliness thereof during\ncutting.  Bone and bone cement fragments are collected and stored away from the bone cutting area thereby reducing the possibility of bone fragment incorporation into living bone tissue.  The low cost modular tapered or spherical hollow reamer gradually\ncrates the bone cavity due to the taper or spherical contour provided, thereby reducing heat during its surgical usage.  Owing to the presence of these features, the low cost modular tapered or spherical hollow reamer of this invention is safer to use\nand operates more efficiently than prior art reamers.

These procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Reamers are also used in procedures that involve the\ninternal fixation of fractures.  Prior art reamers typically fall into two major classes: rigid and flexible shaft.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer.  Solid\ncylindrical or tapered reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper fit\nof the implant.  Conventional reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient\nfriction/heat to damage or kill the surrounding bone.  These prior art solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis. \nThese dull blades also incorporate bone debris or bone cement debris into the living bone tissue, creating bone healing problems.\n If the clinical application requires a guide pin to provide a controlled path for the cutter, it requires that the design provide a complete through hole, which passes through the assembled disposable reamer and the reusable reamer shaft.  The\ncurrent design provides both options through the use of a guide pin.  A cannulated reamer assembly uses a guide pin first to accurately align the reamer concentric with the shaft axis and is removed provided a central hole, which may be used for\naccepting a bone inserted guide pin that accurately sets the reaming direction.  In another version of the disposable tapered hollow reamer with a reusable shaft uses a guide pin which is left behind within the assembly thereby providing additional\nrigidity for the tapered hollow reamer and is extremely desirable in non-cannulated application wherein a bone cavity is drilled on a fresh bone with no previously drilled cavity.\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required during many orthopedic surgical procedures.  These procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Other surgical procedures that see the use of reamers include\ninternal fixation procedures for fractures.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer, illustrated in FIG. 1 at 100.  Prior art reamers typically include a driver coupling 101\n(shown as a Jacob chuck connector), a size designation 102, a pilot tip 103, a shaft 104, and cutting flutes 105.  FIG. 1 shows a tapered reamer, however cylindrical reamers of similar design also exist in the prior art.  Those solid cylindrical or\ntapered reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper fit of the implant. \nConventional reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient friction/heat to\ndamage or kill the surrounding bone.  The bone or bone cement debris collected is pushed against the living bone tissue and may be incorporated into the bone.  Currently utilized solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and\ntherefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.\n FIG. 2A depicts at 200 the low cost modular disposable tapered hollow reamer assembly of the present invention according to the first variant of the first embodiment in three views FIGS. 2A.1, 2A.2 and 2A.3.  The tapered hollow reamer 10 shown\nat FIG. 2A.1 has a reaming portion 14, which is attached at the distal end to a pilot 13.  The pilot has a central aperture 16, which accepts a guide pin that typically has a diameter of 3 mm as shown by the arrow.  The proximal end of the reamer is\nconical in shape with an interior taper which carries a torque-transmitting tab 15.  The barbell shaped guide pin 12 has a central cylindrical rod 21 typically 3.2 mm in diameter with two bar bells 22 as shown.  The shaft 11 has a tapered body element 18\nwhich has an external taper that matches the internal taper of the reamer and has a slot 19 that has the same dimension as that of the torque transmitting tab in the interior surface of the reamer.  The shaft distal end tapered body element has a central\naperture 20, which is also typically 3.5 mm in diameter and accepts the proximal end of the guide pin as shown by the arrow.  The first stage of the assembly of the low cost disposable tapered hollow reamer according to the first variant of the first\nembodiment is shown at FIG. 2A.2.  The distal end of the guide pin is inserted into the aperture of the pilot and the proximal end of the guide pin engages the central aperture in the tapered body element of the shaft while the conical interior surface\nof the reamer contacts the external taper of the tapered body element of the shaft, aligning the centerline of the reamer with that of the shaft.  The torque-transmitting tab of the reamer engages the slot within the tapered body element of the shaft\nallowing the shaft torque to be transmitted to the reamer.  The proximal end of the reamer is folded over the tapered body element of the shaft as shown at FIG. 2A.3 thereby securing the shaft within the reamer preventing its movement.  While FIG. 2A\nillustrates one torque-transmitting tab for clarity while in practice, several torque transmitting tabs may be used.  Since the guide pin 12 is captured within the reamer it provides flexural rigidity and this rigid reamer is most suited for reaming a\nnon-cannulated bone cavity wherein no previously reamed bone cavity is present.  It may also be used for connulated application.  Optionally, the guide pin may be provided with a central aperture (not shown) creating a central aperture through the entire\nlength of the assembled reamer for use in guiding reaming direction with a bone inserted guide pin.  FIG. 2B shows at 200 the details of each of the components of the tapered hollow reamer in three views FIGS. 2B.1, 2B.2 and 2B.3, according to the first\nvariant of the first embodiment of the invention illustrating both front view and side view.  The cutters are shown at 23 and the aperture 24 through which the debris enters the free space F is shown.\n FIG. 3A illustrates the second variant of the first embodiment in three views FIGS. 3A.1, 3A.2 and 3A.3, wherein the structure is similar to the first variant of the first embodiment, except that the guide pin 12 is a cylindrical guide pin but\nwith no barbells.  Identical numbering scheme is used for clarity.  FIG. 3A depicts at 300 the low cost modular disposable tapered hollow reamer assembly of the present invention according to the second variant of the first embodiment.  The tapered\nhollow reamer 10 shown at FIG. 3.A.1 has a reaming portion 14, which is attached at the distal end to a pilot 13.  The pilot has a central aperture 16, which accepts a guide pin that typically has a diameter of 3 mm as shown by the arrow.  The proximal\nend of the reamer is conical in shape with an interior taper which carries a torque-transmitting tab 15.  The cylindrical guide pin 12 has a central cylindrical rod 21 typically 3 mm in diameter as shown.  The shaft 11 has a tapered body element 18 which\nhas an external taper that matches the internal taper of the reamer and has a slot 19 that has the same dimension as that of the torque transmitting tab in the interior surface of the reamer.  The shaft distal end tapered body element has a central\naperture 20, which is also typically 3 mm in diameter and accepts the proximal end of the guide pin as shown by the arrow.  The first stage of the assembly of the low cost disposable tapered hollow reamer according to the second variant of the first\nembodiment is shown at FIG. 3A.2.  The distal end of the guide pin is inserted into the aperture of the pilot and the proximal end of the guide pin engages the central aperture in the tapered body element of the shaft while the conical interior surface\nof the reamer contacts the external taper of the tapered body element of the shaft, aligning the centerline of the reamer with that of the shaft.  The torque-transmitting tab of the reamer engages the slot within the tapered body element of the shaft\nallowing the shaft torque to be transmitted to the reamer.  The proximal end of the reamer is folded over the tapered body element of the shaft as shown at FIG. 3A.3 thereby securing the shaft within the reamer preventing its movement.  While FIG. 3A\nillustrates one torque-transmitting tab for clarity while in practice, several torque transmitting tabs may be used.  The guide pin 12 is pulled away from the assembled reamer providing a central aperture in the reamer for accepting a bone inserted guide\npin that sets the reaming direction precisely.  This reamer is most suited for reaming a cannulated bone cavity wherein a previously reamed bone cavity is present.  FIG. 3B shows the details of each of the components of the tapered hollow reamer in three\nviews FIGS. 3B.1, 3B.2 ands 3B.3 according to the second variant of the first embodiment of the invention illustrating both front view and side views.  The cutters are shown at 23 and the aperture 24 through which the debris enters into the free space F\nis shown.\n FIG. 4A illustrates the third variant of the first embodiment in three views FIGS. 4A.1, 4A.2 and 4A.3 wherein the structure is similar to the first and second variants of the first embodiment, except that the guide pin 12 is a cylindrical guide\npin with threads on its proximal and distal ends engaging with the pilot and tapered body element at the distal end of the shaft.  Identical numbering system is used for clarity.  FIG. 4A depicts at 400 the low cost modular disposable tapered hollow\nreamer assembly of the present invention according to the third variant of the first embodiment.  The tapered hollow reamer 10 shown at FIG. 4A.1 has a reaming portion 14, which is attached at the distal end to a pilot 13.  The pilot has a threaded\ncentral aperture 16, which accepts a guide pin threaded distal end that typically has a diameter of 3 mm as shown by the arrow.  The proximal end of the reamer is conical in shape with an interior taper.  The cylindrical shaped guide pin 12 has a central\ncylindrical rod 21 typically 3 mm in diameter with a threaded distal end 25 and a threaded proximal end 26 as shown.  The shaft 11 has a tapered body element 18, which has an external taper that matches the internal taper of the reamer.  The shaft distal\nend tapered body element has a threaded central aperture 20, which is also typically 3 mm in diameter and accepts the proximal end threads of the guide pin as shown by the arrow.  The first stage of the assembly of the low cost disposable tapered hollow\nreamer according to the third variant of the first embodiment is shown at FIG. 4A.2.  The distal end threads 23 of the guide pin is inserted into the aperture of the pilot and the guide pin is turned using a hex socket 25 to secure the guide pin 12 to\nthe pilot 13.  Next, the shaft 11 is turned to engage the proximal end threads 24 of the guide pin with the threads 20 of the central aperture in the tapered body element of the shaft while the conical interior surface of the reamer contacts the external\ntaper of the tapered body element of the shaft, aligning the centerline of the reamer with that of the shaft.  The threaded attachment allows the shaft torque to be transmitted to the reamer.  The proximal end of the reamer is folded over the tapered\nbody element of the shaft as shown at FIG. 4A.3 thereby securing the shaft within the reamer preventing its movement.  Since the guide pin 12 is captured within the reamer it provides flexural rigidity and this rigid reamer is most suited for reaming a\nnon-cannulated bone cavity wherein no previously reamed bone cavity is present.  It may also be used for connulated application.  Optionally, the guide pin may be provided with a central aperture (not shown) creating a central aperture through the entire\nlength of the assembled reamer for use in guiding reaming direction with a bone inserted guide pin.  FIG. 4B shows the details of each of the components of the tapered hollow reamer in three views FIGS. 4B.1, 43B.2 and 4B.3 according to the third variant\nof the first embodiment of the invention illustrating both front view and side view.  The root diameter of the threads in the pilot 13 and tapered body element 18 is typically 3.2 mm.  The cutters are shown at 23 and the aperture through which the debris\nenters the free space F is shown at 24.\n A number of sizes of tapered hollow reamers are available along with their shafts and modular pilots so that the surgeon can choose progressively larger hollow tapered reamers for a fresh bone canal or a reworked bone canal.  Since the low cost\ntapered hollow reamer 10 is disposable, the cutting performance of the hollow reamer is not compromised through repeated use.  Several limitations of the prior art reamers and consequent clinical problems seen are overcome through utilization of the\ndisposable modular tapered hollow reamers herein.  Novel design features of the hollow reamers of the present invention and improvements to prior art reamers are multifaceted.  Moreover, when dealing with revision hip surgery, the hollow reamers have\nalso been designed to cut bone cement (PMMA) in a more efficient manner by providing internal space within the low cost tapered hollow reamer to capture the debris.  This feature reduces both the cutting temperature and time required to remove the\nremnant cement mantle.  The bone debris collected may be used for bone grafting or other specific surgical procedures.  A further advantage of the hollow design is that by allowing the removal of the bone debris from the outer surface of the reamer to\nthe inside of the reamer, the reamer is less likely to raise the intramedulary pressure in the long bone being reamed, thereby lessening the chance of fat embolism during these procedures.\n FIG. 5A illustrates in two views FIGS. 5A.1 and 5A.2 the second embodiment of the invention wherein a disposable spherical reamer is attached to a reusable shaft using a threaded connection similar to the third variant of the first embodiment. \nThe guide pin 12 is a cylindrical guide pin with threads 23 distal end and threads 24 on its proximal end engaging with threads 16 in the central aperture of the spherical hollow reamer and threads 20 in the central aperture of the tapered body element\nat the distal end of the shaft.  Identical numbering system is used for clarity.  FIG. 5A depicts at 500 the low cost modular disposable spherical hollow reamer assembly of the present invention according to the second embodiment.  The spherical hollow\nreamer 10 shown at FIG. 5A.1 has a reaming portion 29.  The central portion of the spherical reamer has central aperture large enough to accept a hex nut for tightening the guide pin and has a threaded central aperture 16.  The threaded aperture 16\naccepts threaded distal end 23 of a guide pin as shown by the arrow.  The threads typically have a root diameter of 3.2 mm.  The proximal end of the spherical reamer has a conical interior taper.  The cylindrical shaped guide pin 12 has a central\ncylindrical rod 21 a threaded distal end 23 and a threaded proximal end 24 as shown.  The shaft 11 has a tapered body element 18, which has an external taper that matches the internal taper of the proximal end of the spherical reamer.  The shaft distal\nend tapered body element has a threaded central aperture 20, which is also typically 3 mm in diameter and accepts the proximal end threads 24 of the guide pin as shown by the arrow.  The assembly of the low cost disposable spherical hollow reamer\naccording to the second embodiment is shown at FIG. 5A.2.  The distal end of the guide pin is inserted into the aperture of the central aperture of the spherical hollow reamer and the guide pin is turned using a hex socket similar to FIG. 4A.2 (not\nshown) to secure the guide pin 12 to the pilot 13.  Next, the shaft is turned to engage the proximal end threads 24 of the guide pin with the threads 20 of the central aperture in the tapered body element of the shaft while the conical interior surface\nof the spherical hollow reamer contacts the external taper of the tapered body element of the shaft, aligning the centerline of the reamer with that of the shaft.  The threaded attachment allows the shaft torque to be transmitted to the reamer.  Since\nthe guide pin 12 is captured within the reamer it provides flexural rigidity and this rigid reamer is most suited for reaming a non-cannulated bone cavity wherein no previously reamed bone cavity is present.  It may also be used for cannulated\napplication.  FIG. 5B shows in three views FIGS. 5B.1, 5B.2 and 5B.3, the details of each of the components of the spherical hollow reamer according to the second embodiment of the invention illustrating both the front view and the side view.  The root\ndiameter of the central threads 16 of the spherical hollow reamer and threads 20 of the tapered body element 18 are typically 3.2 mm.  The cutters are shown at 23 and the aperture through which the debris enters the free space F is shown at 24.\n A number of sizes of spherical hollow reamers are available along with their shafts so that the surgeon can choose progressively larger spherical hollow reamers for a fresh bone acetabular cavity or a reworked bone acetabular cavity.  Since the\nlow cost spherical hollow reamer 10 is disposable, the cutting performance of the spherical hollow reamer is not compromised through repeated use.  Several limitations of the prior art reamers and consequent clinical problems seen are overcome through\nutilization of the disposable modular tapered hollow reamers herein.  Novel design features of the spherical hollow reamers of the present invention and improvements to prior art reamers are multifaceted.  Moreover, when dealing with revision surgery,\nthe spherical hollow reamers have also been designed to cut bone cement (PMMA) in a more efficient manner by providing internal space within the low cost tapered hollow reamer to capture the debris.  This feature reduces both the cutting temperature and\ntime required to remove the remnant cement mantle.  The bone debris collected may be used for bone grafting or other specific surgical procedures.  A further advantage of the hollow design is that by allowing the removal of the bone debris from the outer\nsurface of the reamer to the inside of the reamer, the reamer is less likely to raise the intramedulary pressure in the long bone being reamed, thereby lessening the chance of fat embolism during these procedures.\n FIG. 6 depicts at 600 four views FIGS. 6A, 6B, 6C and 6D of a perspective view of the assembly of a tapered hollow reamer according to the second variant of the first embodiment of the invention using a hand tool.  The hand tool 28 is similar to\na glue gun and has a fixed portion 29 and an adjustable portion 30.  The reamer 10 of the second variant of the first embodiment with the cylindrical guide pin placed within the central aperture of the pilot is placed on the fixed portion 29 of the hand\ntool 28 as shown in FIG. 6A.  Now the shaft 11 is brought in and inserted within the taper of the proximal end of the reamer engaging the protruding guide pin, torque transmitting tab and hand pushed along the direction of the arrow as shown in FIG. 6B. \nThe adjustable portion 30 of the hand tool 28 is then brought to apply pressure to the tapered body element of the shaft 11 and deform or bend the proximal ends of the reamer 10 as shown in FIG. 6C.  The assembled reamer is removed from the hand tool and\nthe guide pin 12 is slid off from the pilot portion of the assembled reamer as shown in FIG. 6D exposing a central hole within the assembled reamer which may be used to guide the reamer in a direction set by a bone inserted guide pin.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n",

 'patent_description': u"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a modular easy-to-assemble tapered hollow reamer for medical applications; and more particularly, to a hollow tapered reamer having a disposable reamer assembly, which can be attached to a reusable shaft portion\nand includes a bone debris capturing cavity.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  These procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Reamers are also used in procedures that involve the\ninternal fixation of fractures.  Prior art reamers typically fall into two major classes: rigid and flexible shaft.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer.  Solid\ncylindrical or tapered reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper fit\nof the implant.  Conventional reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient\nfriction/heat to damage or kill the surrounding bone.  These prior art solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis. \nThese dull blades also incorporate bone debris or bone cement debris into the living bone tissue, creating bone healing problems.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,116,200 to Braun et al. discloses a milling tool for surgical purposes.  The surgical milling tool is a hand-operated milling machine for milling the heads or sockets of bone joints and has a spherical shape.  The tool is\nformed of a hemispherical cup integrally formed with a cylindrical skirt and flange and is provided with a plurality of openings of semi-oval shape, each having a cutting edge arranged at the minor axis of the oval shape.  The openings are situated such\nthat, upon rotation of the cup, the cutting edges thereof overlap to provide a continuous cutting edge surface conforming generally to the shape of the cup.  The hemispherical shape of the cup provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the\nbone joints.  Bone and cartilage shavings are formed during the milling process and are collected in a border area inside of the hemispherical cup.  The surgical milling tool is provided for multiple uses and therefore the tool will become less efficient\nafter each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  Moreover, the spherically shaped reaming tool is not tapered.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,190,548 to Davis discloses surgical reamer.  This surgical bone reamer includes a rotatable, elongated shank having a proximal end, a distal end and a longitudinal axis.  A reaming head mounted on the distal end.  A plurality\nof equally spaced walls is radially disposed on the reaming head around the longitudinal axis.  Tip edges for penetrating bone are defined on the radial walls to be disposed angularly with the longitudinal axis.  Reaming edges joined to the tip edges\nextend longitudinally from the tip edges in the proximal direction parallel to and an equal radial distance from the longitudinal axis for reaming a cylindrical tunnel when the reaming head is rotated in bone.  Tapered flutes disposed angularly between\nthe tip edges and the radial walls permit bone to be evacuated through the reaming head when forming a tunnel in bone.  The reaming head is provided with angular tips and edges for penetrating the bone and is thus not a single use disposable cutter.  The\ndebris created is not stored away from the cutting edge and thus previously cut material may be included in the bone.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,549,613 to Goble et al. discloses a modular surgical drill.  This modular surgical drill is in the form of a rigid drill shaft and a drill bit, which are connected together by a tongue-and-groove arrangement attaching the rear\nend of the drill bit to the forward end of the drill shaft.  Each of the shaft and drill bit are provided with through bores extending centrally through their entire length.  These bores become aligned upon assembly of the drill bit and shaft.  The\nmodular drill is intended to be employed with a guidewire for drilling holes into bone.  The assembled drill bit and shaft are placed on the guidewire and moved down such guidewire into contact with the bone, whereupon a tunnel may be formed into the\nbone by rotating and advancing the drill bit along the guidewire.  The dimensions of the bore and guidewire are so selected as to prevent the drill bit and drill shaft from moving relative to one another once they are assembled and mounted on the\nguidewire.  Debris created during drilling is not removed and collected away from the cutting location.  The central bore is solid and as such does not receive cut bone debris.  The cutter used is not disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,556,399 to Huebner discloses a bone-harvesting drill apparatus and method for its use.  A coring drill harvests bone from a donor area of the human body.  The drill bit is formed with a cylindrical, hollow shaft and a\nhalf-conical tip or cutting head.  The cutting head is provided with a sharpened edge, which meets at an apex with a non-sharpened edge, forming an obtuse angle of approximately 120 degrees.  The sharpened edge is configured to cut into bone when the\ndrill bit is rotated in a clockwise direction.  With the apex directed against a section of bone, the cutting edge sheers off fragments of bone, which are then drawn upwardly through the hollow shank of the drill bit.  As the drill bit is forced\ndownwardly, continuous cutting action occurs and the morselized bone can then be removed from the shank and used to build-up bone in other areas to which it is transplanted.  The drill bit fittingly mates on the distal end a fitting that renders the\ndrill bit physically compatible with a conventional chuck.  The bit includes a pair of diametrically opposed, oppositely inclined recesses that cooperate with a crossbar member within a bit-receiving bore of the fitting.  When the aligned drill bit is\npressed into the fitting, the crossbar member cams along the inclined recesses causing the bit to rotate relative to the fitting.  The resulting frictional engagement between the recesses and the crossbar member, along with a detent assembly between the\nbit and the fitting, securely lock the bit onto the distal end of the fitting, yet render removal possible by the use of a removal tool.  The bone harvesting tool provides a non-disposable cutter.  Reuse of the cutter dulls the beveled lip edges. \nMoreover, the harvested bone collection central bore requires a thorough cleaning prior to each use, creating contamination possibilities.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,690,634 to Muller et al. discloses a medullary drill head.  This drill head for intramedullary drilling has a front part, a middle part and a rear part and is shaped as a hollow body of revolution.  The front and rear parts\nhave spiral slots formed with cutting edges.  The rear part has an attachment for coupling to a drilling shaft.  The drill head is not disposable, and as a result, the drill head is continuously reused, resulting in dulling of the cutting edges. \nMoreover, the drill head includes three openings in the form of spirally shaped slots configured to have cutting edges similar to a grater; and has no place to collect bone debris.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,954,671 to O'Neill discloses a bone harvesting method and apparatus.  This apparatus and method harvests bone using a manual, cylindrical, multi-directional coring device with a guided delivery system that can be inserted\nthrough a percutaneous or closed approach to extract precisely measured amounts of bone or bone marrow.  A series of guide wires, obturators, dilators and cannulas are used as the exposure and delivery instrumentation for a cutting tool.  The cutting\ntool has a tip with six cutting edges for cutting in all directions.  This apparatus is a manual, cylindrical, multi-directional coring device with a guided delivery system to extract precisely measured amounts of bone or bone marrow.  The cutter portion\nof the device is not disposable and is subject to wear and dull edges.  This coring device does not suggest a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,976,144 to Fishbein et al. discloses a hollow dome reamer with removable teeth.  This surgical reamer has a hollow dome with apertures spaced apart arranged in arcs extending from an apex of the dome to the base portion of the\ndome, and removable teeth positioned in the apertures.  Each cutting tooth has (i) a flange that is aligned flush with the external surface of the dome, (ii) a raised cutting edge extending above the flange and the external surface of the dome, and (iii)\nan interior passageway communicating between the outside and inside of the dome.  A base plate may be removably secured on the base portion of the dome to provide closure for the central cavity of the dome.  Although the teeth are removable, they are not\ndisposable in nature; the teeth are removed for replacement or for re-sharpening and are used again.  Removal of the small teeth may be cumbersome and difficult, and may even pose a danger during removal as the person removing the teeth may be cut by the\nsharp edges; replacement of the teeth into the apertures of the reamer will likely pose the same problems.  The bone debris is not collected away from the cutting edges of the teeth.  This hollow domed reamer is spherically shaped reamer; does not\nsuggest a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,980,170 to Salyer discloses a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is secured at one of the shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool\ncollate is secured at the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be positioned.  The boss has a distal end surface with a groove therein.  Both the groove and the\ndistal end surface extend transversely of the axis.  A pin is positioned in the groove on the axis.  A latch mechanism is provided to hold a mounting bar of a rotary tool in the groove on the pin, whereby the rotary tool is held exactly coaxially of the\ndriver during use.  The rotary tool, which is used with the driver has a bar containing the same dimensions as the groove in the boss of the tool driver.  The bar thus fills and is complementary to the slot.  The bar has a hole therein which is\ncomplementary to the pin.  The pin extends coaxially of the shaft and the boss.  The bar hole in which the pin of the tool driver is positioned is precisely coaxial of the axis of the tool about which the cutting edges are precisely positioned.  The\ncutters are connected to the tip of the shaft and are spherical in nature for joint and patella reaming.  In addition, the reamer cups are not disposable in nature.  The bone fragments are not collected and kept away from the cutting edge.  This\nspherically shaped reamer is not tapered.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,193,722 to Zech et al. discloses a hollow milling tool.  The hollow milling tool produces substantially hollow cylindrical depressions in human or animal tissue.  It also produces tissue pillars, which are removed at a harvest\nlocation, transported to a defect location and implanted.  The hollow milling tool has teeth for the ablation of tissue which are arranged at the distal end of the milling tool at the end side.  Furthermore, the milling tool has passages for transporting\na cooling fluid to a cooling region of the milling tool lying near the distal end during the ablation of tissue.  Teeth are constructed within the milling tool for accomplishing the depressions.  These teeth will eventually need sharpening as the tool is\nused over time.  No structure is contained within the '722 patent that discloses or suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,332,886 to Green et al. discloses a surgical reamer and method of using same.  This device is used for expedited reaming of a medullary canal.  The device includes a reamer head connected at the distal end of a rotatable drive\nshaft.  The reamer head has a cutting head with five blades and flutes therebetween.  Each blade has a front cutting portion.  The blades can also include a side cutting portion.  The method for removing material from the medullary canal of a bone\nincludes the steps of reaming an area of the medullary canal to remove material; irrigating the material to be removed while reaming to reduce generation of heat and move removed material from the reaming area; and aspirating the removed material while\nreaming to create a negative intramedullary canal pressure to assist in the removal of the material.  The blades and flutes at the reamer are reused and are subject to dulling.  The bone chips are to be removed by the irrigating fluid, which means they\nare always present adjacent to the cutting portions and may be forced into the bone tissue.  No disclosure in the '886 patent suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,451,023 to Salazar et al. discloses a guide bushing for coring reamer, storage package for reamer assembly, and method of use.  This guide bushing for a coring reamer has a tapered member with its largest diameter at its first\nend so that the guide bushing frictionally engages an internal surface of the reamer with a line contact.  The guide bushing has a passage sized to slidably receive a guide pin.  In use, the bushing advances in the proximal direction within the coring\nreamer along a guide pin while the excavated bone enters the passageway through the reamer.  A storage package specifically designed for the reamer assembly is employed to remove the excavated bone from within the reamer.  The package has a closed distal\nend and an open proximal end closeable with a cap.  With the coring reamer received in cantilevered fashion through a central opening of the cap of the tube, and with an adapter that couples the coring reamer to a handpiece installed, a wrench is placed\nover the adapter and turned while the user grips peripheral surfaces of the cap to prevent rotation of the coring reamer.  A plunger is inserted through the opening and through the coring reamer from the proximal end.  The plunger is pushed through the\nreamer until the bone core and bushing fall out of the distal end of the coring reamer.  The guide bushing for a coring reamer is appointed with an open end surrounded by peripheral teeth.  The teeth are arranged peripheral to the body of the tube of the\nreamer.  The tube is hollow and therefore excavated bone accumulates therewithin.  The reamer, bushing and packaging are disposed of after use.  The '023 patent discloses a bone excavating tool that does not prepare bone canal for implantation of femoral\nimplants.  No structure is disclosed therein that suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,074,224 to Daniels et al. discloses a modular tapered reamer for bone preparation and associated method.  This kit is for use in performing joint arthroplasty and includes a trial and a reamer.  The reamer is said to be useful\nwhen preparing a cavity in the intramedullary canal of a long bone with the use of a driver, and to assist in performing a trial reduction.  The reamer includes a first portion for placement at least partially in the cavity of the long bone and a second\nportion operably connected to the first portion.  The reamer is removably connected to the driver to rotate the reamer.  The trial is removably attachable to the reamer.  This tapered reamer is not disposable and does not have provision for accumulating\nbone debris away from the cutting portion of the bone.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0113836 to Lozier et al. discloses an expandable reamer.  This expandable reamer includes a cannulated shaft and a plurality of straight cutting blades having deformable points.  The blades are\nhingably outwardly rotatable at the deformation points between a contracted position and an expanded position.  In the contracted position, the blades are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cannulated shaft and, in the expanded\nposition, the blades have at least a portion oriented radially outward from the longitudinal axis, thereby forming a larger diameter cutting surface in the expanded position and in the contracted position.  The blades are formed from a portion of the\ncannulated shaft by, e.g. milling longitudinally extending slots through the wall of the cannulated shaft.  The slots serve as flutes dividing the cutting edge and trailing edge of each adjacent blade.  Each blade may also include more than one segment\narranged along its length, the segments being coupled by deformation points.  The expandable reamer may be used for cutting a cavity in a bone or other structure that is larger than the diameter of the entry point into the bone and greater than the\ndiameter of the contracted reamer.  The expandable reamer is not disposable.  Since the expandable blades are deformably attached to the cannulated shaft, the cut bone debris is not collected away from the bone cutting region.  As a result, fragments of\ncut bone debris may be pushed into the bone tissue by the deformable rotating blades.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0004371 to Williams et al. discloses an orthopedic reamer.  This orthopedic reamer is for use in creating and sizing canals in a bone.  The orthopedic reamer includes a non-polymeric cutting portion\nhaving at least one cutting surface thereon and a polymeric body portion covering at least a portion of the cutting portion.  The at least one cutting surface is not covered by the polymeric body portion.  The orthopedic reamer provides cutting\ncomponents including a blade or saw like construction, rather than the plurality of teeth.  Although the orthopedic reamer is appointed for disposability, the publication requires that the entire reamer, and not just the cutting portion, be disposed of. \nThat is to say, the entire reamer, including the non-polymeric cutting portion and the polymeric body portion of the device are all disposed of; not just the cutter.\n There remains a need in the art for a modular easy-to-assemble hollow tapered reamer for medical applications having a disposable hollow cutter assembly.  Also needed in the art is a disposable hollow cutter assembly of the type described, which\ncan be attached to a reusable shaft portion that provides means for reaming of the internal canal of bones.  Further needed in the art is a cutter assembly having means for collecting bone debris and keeping the collected debris displaced from the\ncutting edges, so that after one use of the reamer a new hollow cutter assembly can be utilized and the old hollow cutter assembly can be discarded.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a modular easy-to-assemble hollow tapered reamer for medical applications having a disposable cutter assembly.  The cutter sleeve is attached to a reusable shaft portion of the reamer and has a space for bone\ndebris collection, which prevents inclusion of bone and bone cement debris into the living bone tissue.  The reusable shaft portion has an integral or user attachable conical section containing one or more slots that receive the disposable cutter and\nthereby transfer shaft torque to the cutter.  The reusable shaft is threaded at the distal end to secure the tapered hollow disposable cutter sleeve, while the proximal end has coupling features for attachment with a drill or other machinery providing\nrotational torque.  The portion of the shaft between the conical section and the proximal end with the coupling may be rigid or flexible.  A flexible shaft permits reaming of bone tissue that is not directly in line and therefore not easily accessible\nwith a straight shaft.  A threaded modular pilot is provided with a collet that mates with the tapered hollow disposable reamer, thereby producing substantial coincidence of alignment between the centerline of the reamer sleeve with that of the reusable\nshaft.  Preferably, a fresh tapered hollow reamer sleeve is used with each new application.  Alternatively, the tapered hollow reamer sleeve is used several times and, after it has become worn or dull, is discarded.  The tapered hollow reamer includes a\nplurality of apertures and is hollow to allow space between the reamer and the reusable shaft for bone and bone cement debris collection.  The tapered hollow reamer sleeve is supplied in different sizes, wherein the distal end dimension D1 is smaller\nthan that of the proximal end.  With this arrangement, there is produced a reamer especially well suited for reaming a tapered hollow cavity.  The semi-cone angle of the reamer may range from about 0.5 degrees to 5 degrees and is determined by the\nequation.\n .alpha..pi..times..times..times..times..times..times..times.  ##EQU00001##\n wherein .alpha.=semi-cone angle in degrees; D1 is the distal diameter of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve; D2 is the proximal diameter of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve; and L is the length of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve;\n Thus, the semi-cone angle depends on the length of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve and the diameters of the distal and proximal ends.  A tapered hollow reamer reusable shaft, and a tapered hollow reamer sleeve of a selected length and modular\npilot are provided as a matching set, while the reusable shaft and modular pilot may be used with one sleeve, or with matching tapered hollow modular sleeves.\n The preferred semi-cone angle is 2 degrees and this is the case when the distal end dimension is 2 mm smaller than that of the proximal end dimension and the tapered hollow reamer sleeve has a length of 57 mm.  The reamer sleeves are provided in\na plurality of sizes with distal end dimension ranging from 7 mm to 18 mm, in step increments of 1 mm.  Thus the semi-taper angle of the reamed bone conical cavity is exactly 2 degrees for each of these reamers, which ream a bone cavity to substantially\nthe same depth of up to 57 mm and produce a bone cavity with substantially the same semi-cone angle of 2 degrees.  Each reamer is attached to a shaft using a modular pilot with a threaded connection.  When the modular pilot is tightened at the threaded\nend of the reusable shaft, the tapered collet of the modular pilot bears against the taper provided in the tapered hollow reamer, thereby causing substantially coincident alignment between the centerline of the reamer and that of the reusable shaft. \nThere are 4 shaft sets provided.  Each shaft is designed to engage with two or three tapered hollow reamer sleeve sizes.  For example, a shaft marked 9-10-11 engages with a 7 mm.times.9 mm reamer, an 8 mm.times.10 mm reamer and a 9 mm.times.11 mm reamer. The reamer portion is prevented from free rotation by one or more slots in the shaft cone element and tabs in the tapered hollow reamer.  Torque from the shaft is transferred to the reamer, providing bone cutting action.  Thus when a drill or other hand\nmachinery rotates the reusable shaft, the shaft torque is transferred to the reamer through the tabs while the reamer is held securely at the centerline of the rotating reusable shift preventing any wobbly motion.  This disposable sharp hollow reamer\ntherefore reduces heat generated during cutting by removing the bone debris from the outer surface of the reamer to the inside of the reamer, while the bone debris collected may be used later for bone grafting and other specific surgical procedures.  A\nfurther advantage of the hollow design is that by allowing the removal of the bone debris from the outer surface of the reamer to the inside of the cutter, the reamer is less likely to raise the intramedulary pressure in the long bone being reamed,\nthereby lessening the chance of fat embolism during these procedures.  Also fragments of bone chips or bone cement are not incorporated in the living bone tissue by the reamer cutting action.\n During assembly, the tapered hollow reamer sleeve is captured between the conical element of the shaft's central section and the conical portion of the modular pilot as the shaft's distal ends thread engage with the threads provided in the\nmodular pilot.  In a first embodiment, the shaft has male threads at the distal end and the modular pilot has a female threaded central aperture, and the length of the shaft projecting beyond the central conical section is slightly greater than the\nlength of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve.  In a variant of the first embodiment, the length of the shaft extending from the central conical section is less than the length of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve, and the modular pilot with the central\nthreaded aperture is extended so as to provide an engaged length slightly exceeding the length of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve.  In a second embodiment the threaded engagement of the distal end of the shaft with that of the modular pilot is made\npossible by having female threaded aperture on the distal end of the shaft, engaging with a male threaded pin centrally extending from the modular pilot.  The length of the shaft may be slightly greater than that of the length of the tapered hollow\nreamer sleeve.  On the other hand, the length of the shaft may be smaller than the length of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve and the extension of the male threaded pin from the modular pilot is sufficiently long to provide an engaged length that is\nslightly greater than the length of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve.\n Generally stated, the reamer for medical applications comprises: (a) a reamer reusable shaft having an elongated body with a proximal end, a conical central element and a distal end, said proximal end having a coupling portion appointed for\nattachment of said reamer to a drilling device, said distal end having a threaded portion; (b) said central portion of said reamer reusable shaft having a pre-assembled cone element or a modular user assembled cone element having two or more lateral\nslots; (c) a disposable tapered hollow reamer comprising: (1) a disposable hollow reamer sleeve portion having an outer surface, said disposable hollow reamer sleeve portion further comprising a plurality of cutting teeth and a plurality of apertures on\nsaid outer surface; and at least one torque transmitting tab integrally attached to said hollow cutter sleeve at a larger diameter end designed to engage with at least one slot of said shaft conical central element, thereby transferring torque from said\nreusable shaft to said hollow tapered reamer sleeve; (3) the smaller diameter end of the tapered hollow cutter sleeve having a collet taper; (d) a modular pilot with an external collet taper that engages said collet taper of said hollow tapered reamer\nsleeve and a female threaded aperture for engaging with the shaft distal end threads and centering said tapered hollow reamer sleeve during assembly.\n The present invention of modular tapered reamer solves the problems associated with the prior art reamers.  In accordance with the present invention, the modular tapered hollow reamer for medical applications has an easy-to-assemble disposable\nmodular hollow tapered reamer sleeve, which can be attached to a reusable shaft that allows for a fresh cutter assembly to be used with each new application of the reamer.  The modular tapered hollow reamer of the present invention transfers shaft torque\nreliably while at the same time maintains the centerline of the reamer preventing wobbliness thereof during cutting.  Bone and bone cement fragments are collected and stored away from the bone cutting area thereby reducing the possibility of bone\nfragment incorporation into living bone tissue.  The modular tapered hollow reamer gradually crates the bone cavity due to the taper provided, thereby reducing heat during its surgical usage.  Owing to the presence of these features, the modular tapered\nhollow reamer of this invention is safer to use and operates more efficiently than prior art reamers.

These procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Other surgical procedures that see the use of reamers include\ninternal fixation procedures for fractures.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer, illustrated in FIG. 1.  Prior art reamers typically include a driver coupling 11 (shown\nas a Jacob chuck connector), a size designation 12, a pilot tip 13, a shaft 14, and cutting flutes 15.  FIG. 1 shows a tapered reamer, however cylindrical reamers of similar design also exist in the prior art.  Those solid cylindrical or tapered reamers\ncurrently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper fit of the implant.  Conventional\nreamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient friction/heat to damage or\nkill the surrounding bone.  The bone or bone cement debris collected is pushed against the living bone tissue and may be incorporated into the bone.  Currently utilized solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore\nbecome less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.\n FIG. 2 depicts at 20 the modular disposable tapered hollow reamer assembly of the present invention, which provides the disposable hollow reamers appointed for use in medical applications.  Due to its taper, it gradually enlarges the diameter of\nthe bone canal reducing the amount of pressure applied to the bone.  A number of sizes of tapered hollow reamers are available along with their shafts and modular pilots so that the surgeon can choose progressively larger hollow tapered reamers for a\nfresh bone canal or a reworked bone canal.  Since the hollow reamer sleeves are disposable, the cutting performance of the hollow reamer is not compromised through repeated use.  Several limitations of the prior art reamers and consequent clinical\nproblems seen are overcome through utilization of the disposable modular tapered hollow reamers herein.  Novel design features of the hollow reamers of the present invention and improvements to prior art reamers are multifaceted.  The design includes a\nreusable shaft 23 with one or more lateral slots in a central conical section.  A disposable tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 is slid over the central conical section engaging torque transmitting tabs of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve with the slots. \nThe disposable tapered hollow reamer is held in place by the modular pilot 27, which is screwed into the threaded distal end of the shaft 23.  During this threaded attachment, a collet taper of disposable tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 engages with a\ncorresponding collet taper provided on the external surface of the modular pilot 27, substantially aligning the centerline of the disposable tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 with that of the reusable shaft 23.  The end of modular pilot 27 that is distal\nfrom the collet taper has a blunt or bullet shape, which facilitates centering of the tapered hollow reamer.  The male thread of the shaft distal end and the female central thread of the modular pilot may be provided with a left-handed thread, so that\nthe attachment does not come loose during the reaming operation.  The shaft 23 is attached to a drill at 21.  A number of shaft sizes can be selected from a kit and the shaft size is indicated at 22.  The drill depth is indicated by depth markings 24. \nShaft 23 has an integral or user attached cone section 25 and a disposable hollow reamer sleeve 26.  The modular pilot may carry indicia representing a shaft size to which it may be connected.  Preferably, the hollow reamer sleeve 26 is discarded after a\nsingle use to ensure a sharp cutter during surgery.  Alternatively, the hollow reamer sleeve 26 is used several times and after becoming worn is discarded.  Various techniques may be used to determine if the hollow reamer sleeve is worn enough to require\ndisposal.  Such techniques may include measurements of the sharpness of the hollow reamer sleeve.  Moreover, when dealing with revision hip surgery, the hollow reamers have also been designed to cut bone cement (PMMA) in a more efficient manner by\nproviding internal space 34 to capture the debris.  This feature reduces both the cutting temperature and time required to remove the remnant cement mantle.  The bone debris collected and removed may be used for bone grafting or other specific surgical\nprocedures.  A further advantage of the hollow design is that by allowing the removal of the bone debris from the outer surface of the reamer to the inside of the reamer, the reamer is less likely to raise the intramedulary pressure in the long bone\nbeing reamed, thereby lessening the chance of fat embolism during these procedures.\n FIG. 3a depicts at 30 the mechanical attachment details of the modular disposable tapered hollow reamer assembly according to the first embodiment.  Identical indicia are used to keep track of various components.  The reusable shaft 23 has the\nshaft cone element 25 with one or more slots 31, one above and one below are shown.  The tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 has two torque transmitting tabs 32 engaging into the slots 31 of the shaft cone element 25.  As a result, when the shaft 23 is\nrotated, the tapered hollow reamer sleeve is also rotated with no slippage.  The distal end of the tapered hollow reamer is provided with a collet taper as shown at 37.  The distal end of the shaft 23 is threaded as shown at 35.  A modular pilot 27 has\nfemale threads 36 that mate with the shaft distal end threads.  The modular pilot has a collet taper at 38 that mates with the collet taper 37 of the tapered hollow reamer, centering the reamer as it is tightened.  The space 34 that is between tapered\nhollow reamer sleeve 26 and the reusable shaft 23 receives the bone and bone cement debris.\n FIG. 3b depicts at 30 the mechanical attachment details of the modular disposable tapered hollow reamer assembly according to the second embodiment.  Identical indicia are used to keep track of various components.  The reusable shaft 23 has the\nshaft cone element 25 with one or more slots 31 (one above and one below are shown).  The tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 has two torque transmitting tabs 32 engaging into the slots 31 of the shaft cone element 25.  As a result, when the shaft 23 is\nrotated, the tapered hollow reamer sleeve is also rotated with no slippage.  The distal end of the tapered hollow reamer is provided with a collet taper as shown at 37.  The distal end of the shaft 23 has female threads as shown at 35.  A modular pilot\n27 has male threads 36 that mate with the shaft distal end threads.  The modular pilot has a collet taper at 38 that mates with the collet taper 37 of the tapered hollow reamer, centering the reamer as it is tightened.  The space 34 that is between\ntapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 and the reusable shaft 23 receives the bone and bone cement debris.\n FIG. 4 illustrates in two views the design of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve.  FIG. 4A is a front view depicting the disposable hollow reamer which has one or more torque transmitting tabs (two shown in the drawing) on the larger diameter end\nand a collet taper in the smaller diameter end.  FIG. 4b shows a perspective view of the larger diameter end with two torque transmitting tabs.  FIGS. 4A and 4B depict at 26 the disposable hollow reamer sleeve, which comprises: (i) a disposable hollow\nreamer sleeve portion having an outer surface 41 having a hollow construction, the disposable hollow reamer sleeve portion further comprising a plurality of cutting teeth 42 and a plurality of apertures (also at 42) on the outer surface 41; (ii) a\nplurality (two shown) of torque transmitting tabs 43 integrally attached to the tapered hollow reamer; at the larger diameter end and (iii) a collet taper 44 on the smaller diameter end.  Preferably, the cutting teeth 42 protrude from the outer surface\nof the disposable hollow cutter sleeve, consequently forming the plurality of apertures.  Alternatively, the plurality of apertures can be separate and distinct from the cutting teeth on the outer surface of the disposable hollow cutter sleeve.\n The thickness of the hollow reamer sleeve portion should impart sufficient strength to withstand offset loads and axial loads on the reamer shaft during advancement of the cutter.  The amount of load that can be tolerated without warping or\nchanging the accuracy of the machined cavity can be determined by laboratory tests, which replicate clinical usage of the instrument.  Typically, the disposable hollow reamer sleeve portion has a wall thickness ranging from 0.005 to 0.039 inch. \nPreferably the wall thickness of the hollow reamer sleeve portion ranges from 0.010 to 0.032 inch, and most preferably from 0.012 to 0.015 inch.  These thickness facilitate cutting by a disposable, low cost, hollow reamer sleeve in an accurate, efficient\nand reliable manner.\n FIG. 5a illustrates a family of disposable tapered hollow sleeves provided.  The family of disposable tapered hollow sleeves provided according to the present invention addresses a wide range of bone sizes, including sizes ranging from 7 mm\nthrough 18 mm in one (1) mm increments; and being tapered and having a 7 mm tapering to a larger diameter in one (1) to three (3) mm increments and having size options from a 7 mm base dimension to an 18 mm base dimension in one (1) mm increments.  The\nlength of the reamer increases as the base size of the reamer is increased thereby having the ability to ream a deeper bone cavity.\n FIG. 5b illustrates a family of preferred equal length disposable tapered hollow sleeves.  The family of disposable tapered hollow sleeves provided according to the present invention addresses a wide range of bone sizes, including sizes ranging\nfrom 7 mm through 18 mm in one (1) mm increments.  Each hollow tapered reamer increases by exactly 2 mm from the distal end to proximal end and has a length of exactly 57 mm.  All these reamers ream a bone cavity with a 2 degree semi-cone angle to an\nidentical depth of 57 mm.  The larger the reamer size, the larger is the diameter of the conical bone cavity.\n Multiple disposable tapered hollow sleeves can be attached to a single shaft, as is illustrated in FIGS. 6a and 6b.  Preferably, a single shaft will attach to at least two or three different sizes of disposable hollow reamers.  The tapered\nhollow reamers of FIG. 6a have unequal lengths, while the tapered hollow reamers of FIG. 6b have equal lengths of 57 mm.  This provides for the ability to combine various sized shafts with various sized disposable hollow reamers.  These reusable reamer\nshafts have a coupling on the proximal end and a threaded portion in the distal end.  The shaft portion between the proximal end and the central portion may be made flexible to facilitate insertion of the tapered hollow reamer.  Each reusable shaft has\nan integrally attached or user attachable modular cone element with one or more lateral slots for receiving the torque transmitting tabs of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve, as shown in FIG. 4B, and a threaded portion at the distal end for retaining the\nmodular pilot in accordance with the invention.\n FIG. 7a provides an assembly view depicting the tapered hollow reamer assembly according to the first embodiment.  The assembled taped hollow reamer and the three component parts are shown.  The hollow reamer sleeve 26 is inserted over the cone\nsection 31 of the reusable shaft 23 with the torque transmitting tabs of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 positioned within the shaft cone section lateral slots.  The modular pilot 27 with a female threaded aperture is screwed on to the end of the\nreusable shaft with a male threading, capturing the disposable tapered hollow reamer sleeve.  The collet taper is provided at the end portion of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve, and the modular pilot substantially aligns the centerline of the tapered\nhollow reamer sleeve with the centerline of the reusable shaft.\n FIG. 7b provides an assembly view depicting the tapered hollow reamer assembly according to the second embodiment.  The assembled taped hollow reamer and the three component parts are shown.  The hollow reamer sleeve 26 is inserted over the cone\nsection 31 of the reusable shaft 23 with the torque transmitting tabs of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 positioned within lateral slots of the shaft cone section.  The modular pilot 27 with the male threads is screwed onto the end of the reusable\nshaft with a female threaded aperture, capturing the disposable tapered hollow reamer sleeve.  The collet taper is provided at the end portion of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve, and the modular pilot substantially aligns the centerline of the tapered\nhollow reamer sleeve with the centerline of the reusable shaft.\n FIG. 8 depicts a mode of construction for the tapered hollow reamer assembly.  Since the reusable shaft 23 has a coupling suited for attachment to a drill at the proximal end, it may be placed in a vice or chuck 81 to secure the reusable shaft\nin a vertical position, as shown.  Next the tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 is inserted over the shaft as shown, engaging the torque transmitting tabs of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve with the lateral slots provided at the cone section 31 of the\nreusable shaft 23.  Next, the modular pilot is screwed into the threads at the distal end of the reusable shaft 23 and is tightened with a wrench 83.  The modular pilot may be provided with a set of notches to accommodate a wrench.  A handle 82 attached\nto the vice or chuck 81 provides support during this tightening procedure.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n",

 'patent_description': u"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a modular, easy-to-assemble, tapered, hollow reamer for medical applications; and more particularly, to a modular, tapered, hollow reamer that is inexpensive to produce and has a disposable reamer assembly, which\ncan be attached to a reusable shaft portion and includes one or more bone debris capturing cavities.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  These procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Reamers are also used in procedures that involve the\ninternal fixation of fractures.  Prior art reamers typically fall into two major classes: rigid and flexible shaft.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer.  Solid\ncylindrical or tapered reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper fit\nof the implant.  Conventional reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer acquires dull cutting edges, its bone cutting efficiency is substantially reduced.  In such cases the\nreamer can generate sufficient friction/heat to damage or kill the surrounding bone.  These prior art solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting\nperformance and bone necrosis.  Dull reamer blades can also incorporate bone debris or bone cement debris into the living bone tissue, creating bone healing problems.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,116,200 to Braun et al. discloses a milling tool for surgical purposes.  The surgical milling tool is a hand-operated milling machine for milling the heads or sockets of bone joints and has a spherical shape.  The tool is\nformed of a hemispherical cup integrally formed with a cylindrical skirt and flange and is provided with a plurality of openings of semi-oval shape, each having a cutting edge arranged at the minor axis of the oval shape.  The openings are situated such\nthat, upon rotation of the cup, the cutting edges thereof overlap to provide a continuous cutting edge surface conforming generally to the shape of the cup.  The hemispherical shape of the cup provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the\nbone joints.  Bone and cartilage shavings are formed during the milling process and are collected in a border area inside of the hemispherical cup.  The surgical milling tool is provided for multiple uses and therefore the tool will become less efficient\nafter each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  Moreover, the spherically shaped reaming tool is not tapered.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,190,548 to Davis discloses surgical reamer.  This surgical bone reamer includes a rotatable, elongated shank having a proximal end, a distal end and a longitudinal axis.  A reaming head mounted on the distal end.  A plurality\nof equally spaced walls is radially disposed on the reaming head around the longitudinal axis.  Tip edges for penetrating bone are defined on the radial walls to be disposed angularly with the longitudinal axis.  Reaming edges joined to the tip edges\nextend longitudinally from the tip edges in the proximal direction parallel to and an equal radial distance from the longitudinal axis for reaming a cylindrical tunnel when the reaming head is rotated in bone.  Tapered flutes disposed angularly between\nthe tip edges and the radial walls permit bone to be evacuated through the reaming head when forming a tunnel in bone.  The reaming head is provided with angular tips and edges for penetrating the bone and is thus not a single use disposable cutter.  The\ndebris created is not stored away from the cutting edge and thus previously cut material may be included in the bone.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,549,613 to Goble et al. discloses a modular surgical drill.  This modular surgical drill is in the form of a rigid drill shaft and a drill bit, which are connected together by a tongue-and-groove arrangement attaching the rear\nend of the drill bit to the forward end of the drill shaft.  Each of the shaft and drill bit are provided with through bores extending centrally through their entire length.  These bores become aligned upon assembly of the drill bit and shaft.  The\nmodular drill is intended to be employed with a guidewire for drilling holes into bone.  The assembled drill bit and shaft are placed on the guidewire and moved down such guidewire into contact with the bone, whereupon a tunnel may be formed into the\nbone by rotating and advancing the drill bit along the guidewire.  The dimensions of the bore and guidewire are so selected as to prevent the drill bit and drill shaft from moving relative to one another once they are assembled and mounted on the\nguidewire.  Debris created during drilling is not removed and collected away from the cutting location.  The central bore is solid and as such does not receive cut bone debris.  The cutter used is not disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,556,399 to Huebner discloses a bone-harvesting drill apparatus and method for its use.  A coring drill harvests bone from a donor area of the human body.  The drill bit is formed with a cylindrical, hollow shaft and a\nhalf-conical tip or cutting head.  The cutting head is provided with a sharpened edge, which meets at an apex with a non-sharpened edge, forming an obtuse angle of approximately 120 degrees.  The sharpened edge is configured to cut into bone when the\ndrill bit is rotated in a clockwise direction.  With the apex directed against a section of bone, the cutting edge sheers off fragments of bone, which are then drawn upwardly through the hollow shank of the drill bit.  As the drill bit is forced\ndownwardly, continuous cutting action occurs and the morselized bone can then be removed from the shank and used to build-up bone in other areas to which it is transplanted.  The drill bit fittingly mates on the distal end a fitting that renders the\ndrill bit physically compatible with a conventional chuck.  The bit includes a pair of diametrically opposed, oppositely inclined recesses that cooperate with a crossbar member within a bit-receiving bore of the fitting.  When the aligned drill bit is\npressed into the fitting, the crossbar member cams along the inclined recesses causing the bit to rotate relative to the fitting.  The resulting frictional engagement between the recesses and the crossbar member, along with a detent assembly between the\nbit and the fitting, securely lock the bit onto the distal end of the fitting, yet render removal possible by the use of a removal tool.  The bone harvesting tool provides a non-disposable cutter.  Reuse of the cutter dulls the beveled lip edges. \nMoreover, the harvested bone collection central bore requires a thorough cleaning prior to each use, creating contamination possibilities.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,690,634 to Muller et al. discloses a medullary drill head.  This drill head for intramedullary drilling has a front part, a middle part and a rear part and is shaped as a hollow body of revolution.  The front and rear parts\nhave spiral slots formed with cutting edges.  The rear part has an attachment for coupling to a drilling shaft.  The drill head is not disposable, and as a result, the drill head is continuously reused, resulting in dulling of the cutting edges. \nMoreover, the drill head includes three openings in the form of spirally shaped slots configured to have cutting edges similar to a grater; and has no place to collect bone debris.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,954,671 to O'Neill discloses a bone harvesting method and apparatus.  This apparatus and method harvests bone using a manual, cylindrical, multi-directional coring device with a guided delivery system that can be inserted\nthrough a percutaneous or closed approach to extract precisely measured amounts of bone or bone marrow.  A series of guide wires, obturators, dilators and cannulas are used as the exposure and delivery instrumentation for a cutting tool.  The cutting\ntool has a tip with six cutting edges for cutting in all directions.  This apparatus is a manual, cylindrical, multi-directional coring device with a guided delivery system to extract precisely measured amounts of bone or bone marrow.  The cutter portion\nof the device is not disposable and is subject to wear and dull edges.  This coring device does not suggest a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,976,144 to Fishbein et al. discloses a hollow dome reamer with removable teeth.  This surgical reamer has a hollow dome with apertures spaced apart arranged in arcs extending from an apex of the dome to the base portion of the\ndome, and removable teeth positioned in the apertures.  Each cutting tooth has (i) a flange that is aligned flush with the external surface of the dome, (ii) a raised cutting edge extending above the flange and the external surface of the dome, and (iii)\nan interior passageway communicating between the outside and inside of the dome.  A base plate may be removably secured on the base portion of the dome to provide closure for the central cavity of the dome.  Although the teeth are removable, they are not\ndisposable in nature; the teeth are removed for replacement or for re-sharpening and are used again.  Removal of the small teeth may be cumbersome and difficult, and may even pose a danger during removal as the person removing the teeth may be cut by the\nsharp edges; replacement of the teeth into the apertures of the reamer will likely pose the same problems.  The bone debris is not collected away from the cutting edges of the teeth.  This hollow domed reamer is spherically shaped reamer; does not\nsuggest a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,980,170 to Salyer discloses a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is secured at one of the shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool\ncollate is secured at the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be positioned.  The boss has a distal end surface with a groove therein.  Both the groove and the\ndistal end surface extend transversely of the axis.  A pin is positioned in the groove on the axis.  A latch mechanism is provided to hold a mounting bar of a rotary tool in the groove on the pin, whereby the rotary tool is held exactly coaxially of the\ndriver during use.  The rotary tool, which is used with the driver has a bar containing the same dimensions as the groove in the boss of the tool driver.  The bar thus fills and is complementary to the slot.  The bar has a hole therein which is\ncomplementary to the pin.  The pin extends coaxially of the shaft and the boss.  The bar hole in which the pin of the tool driver is positioned is precisely coaxial of the axis of the tool about which the cutting edges are precisely positioned.  The\ncutters are connected to the tip of the shaft and are spherical in nature for joint and patella reaming.  In addition, the reamer cups are not disposable in nature.  The bone fragments are not collected and kept away from the cutting edge.  This\nspherically shaped reamer is not tapered.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,193,722 to Zech et al. discloses a hollow milling tool.  The hollow milling tool produces substantially hollow cylindrical depressions in human or animal tissue.  It also produces tissue pillars, which are removed at a harvest\nlocation, transported to a defect location and implanted.  The hollow milling tool has teeth for the ablation of tissue which are arranged at the distal end of the milling tool at the end side.  Furthermore, the milling tool has passages for transporting\na cooling fluid to a cooling region of the milling tool lying near the distal end during the ablation of tissue.  Teeth are constructed within the milling tool for accomplishing the depressions.  These teeth will eventually need sharpening as the tool is\nused over time.  No structure is contained within the '722 patent that discloses or suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,332,886 to Green et al. discloses a surgical reamer and method of using same.  This device is used for expedited reaming of a medullary canal.  The device includes a reamer head connected at the distal end of a rotatable drive\nshaft.  The reamer head has a cutting head with five blades and flutes therebetween.  Each blade has a front cutting portion.  The blades can also include a side cutting portion.  The method for removing material from the medullary canal of a bone\nincludes the steps of reaming an area of the medullary canal to remove material; irrigating the material to be removed while reaming to reduce generation of heat and move removed material from the reaming area; and aspirating the removed material while\nreaming to create a negative intramedullary canal pressure to assist in the removal of the material.  The blades and flutes at the reamer are reused and are subject to dulling.  The bone chips are to be removed by the irrigating fluid, which means they\nare always present adjacent to the cutting portions and may be forced into the bone tissue.  No disclosure in the '886 patent suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,451,023 to Salazar et al. discloses a guide bushing for a coring reamer, a storage package for reamer assembly, and a method of use.  This guide bushing for a coring reamer has a tapered member with its largest diameter at its\nfirst end so that the guide bushing frictionally engages an internal surface of the reamer with a line contact.  The guide bushing has a passage sized to slidably receive a guide pin.  In use, the bushing advances in the proximal direction within the\ncoring reamer along a guide pin while the excavated bone enters the passageway through the reamer.  A storage package specifically designed for the reamer assembly is employed to remove the excavated bone from within the reamer.  The package has a closed\ndistal end and an open proximal end closeable with a cap.  With the coring reamer received in cantilevered fashion through a central opening of the cap of the tube, and with an adapter that couples the coring reamer to a handpiece installed, a wrench is\nplaced over the adapter and turned while the user grips peripheral surfaces of the cap to prevent rotation of the coring reamer.  A plunger is inserted through the opening and through the coring reamer from the proximal end.  The plunger is pushed\nthrough the reamer until the bone core and bushing fall out of the distal end of the coring reamer.  The guide bushing for a coring reamer is appointed with an open end surrounded by peripheral teeth.  The teeth are arranged peripheral to the body of the\ntube of the reamer.  The tube is hollow and therefore excavated bone accumulates therewithin.  The reamer, bushing and packaging are disposed of after use.  The '023 patent discloses a bone excavating tool that does not prepare a bone canal for\nimplantation of femoral implants.  No structure is disclosed therein that suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,074,224 to Daniels et al. discloses a modular tapered reamer for bone preparation and associated method.  This kit is for use in performing joint arthroplasty and includes a trial and a reamer.  The reamer is said to be useful\nwhen preparing a cavity in the intramedullary canal of a long bone with the use of a driver, and to assist in performing a trial reduction.  The reamer includes a first portion for placement at least partially in the cavity of the long bone and a second\nportion operably connected to the first portion.  The reamer is removably connected to the driver to rotate the reamer.  The trial is removably attachable to the reamer.  This tapered reamer is not disposable and does not have provision for accumulating\nbone debris away from the cutting portion of the bone.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0113836 to Lozier et al. discloses an expandable reamer.  This expandable reamer includes a cannulated shaft and a plurality of straight cutting blades having deformable points.  The blades are\nhingably outwardly rotatable at the deformation points between a contracted position and an expanded position.  In the contracted position, the blades are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cannulated shaft and, in the expanded\nposition, the blades have at least a portion oriented radially outward from the longitudinal axis, thereby forming a larger diameter cutting surface in the expanded position and in the contracted position.  The blades are formed from a portion of the\ncannulated shaft by, e.g. milling longitudinally extending slots through the wall of the cannulated shaft.  The slots serve as flutes dividing the cutting edge and trailing edge of each adjacent blade.  Each blade may also include more than one segment\narranged along its length, the segments being coupled by deformation points.  The expandable reamer may be used for cutting a cavity in a bone or other structure that is larger than the diameter of the entry point into the bone and greater than the\ndiameter of the contracted reamer.  The expandable reamer is not disposable.  Since the expandable blades are deformably attached to the cannulated shaft, the cut bone debris is not collected away from the bone cutting region.  As a result, fragments of\ncut bone debris may be pushed into the bone tissue by the deformable rotating blades.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0004371 to Williams et al. discloses an orthopedic reamer.  This orthopedic reamer is for use in creating and sizing canals in a bone.  The orthopedic reamer includes a non-polymeric cutting portion\nhaving at least one cutting surface thereon and a polymeric body portion covering at least a portion of the cutting portion.  The at least one cutting surface is not covered by the polymeric body portion.  The orthopedic reamer provides cutting\ncomponents including a blade or saw like construction, rather than the plurality of teeth.  Although the orthopedic reamer is appointed for disposability, the publication requires that the entire reamer, and not just the cutting portion, be disposed of. \nThat is to say, the entire reamer, including the non-polymeric cutting portion and the polymeric body portion of the device are all disposed of; not just the cutter.\n There remains a need in the art for a low cost, modular, easy-to-assemble, hollow tapered reamer for medical applications having a disposable hollow cutter assembly.  Also needed in the art is a disposable hollow cutter assembly of the type\ndescribed, which can be attached to a reusable shaft portion that provides means for reaming of the internal canal of bones.  Further needed in the art is a cutter assembly having means for collecting bone debris and keeping the collected debris\ndisplaced from the cutting edges, so that the cutting edges remain during drilling and after one use of the reamer a new hollow cutter assembly can be utilized, and the old hollow cutter assembly can be discarded.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a low cost, modular, easy-to-assemble hollow tapered reamer for medical applications having a disposable cutter assembly.  The cutter assembly is attached to a reusable shaft portion of the reamer and has a space\nfor bone debris collection, which prevents inclusion of bone and bone cement debris into the living bone tissue.  The reusable shaft portion has a central shaft with torque transmitting tabs that engage with corresponding slots in the polymeric portion\nof the low cost modular disposable hollow tapered reamer.  The reusable shaft is threaded at the distal end to secure the low cost modular tapered hollow disposable cutter.  A threaded modular pilot is provided securing the low cost modular tapered\nhollow disposable cutter to the shaft.  The threading is of an orientation that the connection between the shaft and the low cost modular tapered hollow disposable cutter does not loosen as the shaft is rotated during the reaming operation.  Preferably,\na fresh tapered hollow reamer is used with each new application.  The tapered hollow reamer includes a plurality of apertures and is hollow to allow space between the reamer and the reusable shaft for bone and bone cement debris collection.  It is\nattached to a shaft using a modular pilot with a threaded connection.  Torque from the shaft is transferred to the reamer through the tabs that transfer the torque to the polymeric member which integrally connected to cutting blades, providing bone\ncutting action.  Thus when a drill or other hand machinery rotates the reusable shaft, the shaft torque is transferred to the reamer through the tabs while the reamer is held securely at the centerline of the rotating reusable shift, preventing any\nwobbly motion.  This disposable sharp hollow reamer therefore reduces heat generated during cutting by removing the bone debris from the outer surface of the reamer to the inside of the reamer, while the bone debris collected may be used later for bone\ngrafting and other specific surgical procedures.  A further advantage of the hollow design is that by allowing the removal of the bone debris from the outer surface of the reamer to the inside of the cutter, the reamer is less likely to raise the\nintramedulary pressure in the long bone being reamed, thereby lessening the chance of fat embolism during these procedures.  Also fragments of bone chips or bone cement are not incorporated in the living bone tissue by the reamer cutting action.\n Generally stated, the reamer for medical applications comprises: (a) a reamer reusable shaft having an elongated body with a proximal end, one or more torque transmission tabs in the central portion, said proximal end having a coupling portion\nappointed for attachment of said reamer to a drilling device, said distal end having a threaded portion; (b) said torque transmission tabs of said reamer reusable shaft engaging with a tapered poured or injection molded polymeric portion of a low cost\ndisposable hollow reamer assembly; (c) a disposable tapered hollow reamer assembly comprising: (1) in a first embodiment a tapered metallic sleeve with a plurality of cutter elements protruding from the outer surface of the sleeve, a plurality of\napertures adjacent to the cutters, a plurality of anchoring protrusions extending into the interior of the sleeve for engaging with a poured or injection molded polymeric portion; (2) in a second embodiment a polymeric sleeve with a plurality of\napertures, some apertures discharging bone debris and some apertures being designed to receive along a line plurality of metallic cutter elements that has both cutting protrusions extending outward from the polymeric sleeve and anchoring protrusions\nextending inwards into the interior of the sleeve; (3) the metallic or polymeric sleeve permanently bonded to a poured or injection molded polymeric portion anchoring the metallic sleeve or polymeric sleeve with inserted metallic cutting elements along a\nline where anchoring protrusions are present; (4) said poured or injection molded polymeric portion having bone debris or bone cement gathering chamber directly below the apertures of metallic sleeve or polymeric sleeve; (5) said poured or injection\nmolded polymeric portion having a central aperture with torque transmitting slots for receiving a reusable shaft with one or more torque transmitting tabs (d) a pair of end plates to constrain bone fragments and bone cement debris collected; and (e) a\nmodular pilot that engages said poured or injection molded polymeric portion with integrally attached cutters with the shaft distal end threads of the reusable shaft thereby centering said tapered hollow reamer assembly along the rotational axis of the\nreusable shaft.\n The present invention of modular tapered reamer solves the problems associated with the prior art reamers.  In accordance with the present invention, the low cost modular tapered hollow reamer for medical applications has an easy-to-assemble,\ndisposable, modular, hollow tapered reamer with a cutting sleeve and a central polymeric poured or injection molded portion, which can be attached to a reusable shaft using torque transmitting shaft tabs and a modular pilot that allows for a fresh cutter\nto be used with each new application of the reamer.  The low cost modular tapered hollow reamer of the present invention transfers shaft torque reliably while at the same time maintains the centerline of the reamer preventing wobbliness thereof during\ncutting.  Bone and bone cement fragments are collected and stored away from the bone cutting area thereby reducing the possibility of bone fragment incorporation into living bone tissue.  The low cost modular tapered hollow reamer gradually crates the\nbone cavity due to the taper provided, thereby reducing heat during its surgical usage.  Owing to the presence of these features, the low cost modular tapered hollow reamer of this invention is safer to use and operates more efficiently than prior art\nreamers. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n The invention will be more fully understood and further advantages will become apparent when reference is had to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings, in which:\n FIG. 1 is a perspective view depicting a medical tapered reamer found in the prior art;\n FIG. 2 is a perspective view depicting a medical tapered reamer of the subject invention assembled on a reusable shaft;\n FIG. 3 depicts in three views, FIG. 3a, FIG. 3b and FIG. 3c, a perspective view of the mechanical details of construction of the low cost disposable tapered hollow reamer according to the first embodiment of the invention;\n FIG. 4 depicts in five views FIG. 4a, FIG. 4b.  FIG. 4c FIG. 4d and FIG. 4e, a perspective view of the mechanical details of construction of the low cost disposable tapered hollow reamer according to the second embodiment of the invention; and\n FIG. 5 depicts in two views, FIG. 5a and FIG. 5b, the manufacturing process for the low cost disposable hollow tapered reamer.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required during many orthopedic surgical procedures.  These procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Other surgical procedures that see the use of reamers include\ninternal fixation procedures for fractures.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer, illustrated in FIG. 1.  Prior art reamers typically include a driver coupling 11 (shown\nas a Jacob chuck connector), a size designation 12, a pilot tip 13, a shaft 14, and cutting flutes 15.  FIG. 1 shows a tapered reamer, however cylindrical reamers of similar design also exist in the prior art.  Those solid cylindrical or tapered reamers\ncurrently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper fit of the implant.  Conventional\nreamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient friction/heat to damage or\nkill the surrounding bone.  The bone or bone cement debris collected is pushed against the living bone tissue and may be incorporated into the bone.  Currently utilized solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore\nbecome less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.\n FIG. 2 depicts at 20 the low cost modular disposable tapered hollow reamer assembly of the present invention, which provides the low cost disposable hollow reamer 22 attached to a shaft 21 appointed for use in medical applications.  Due to its\ntaper, it gradually enlarges the diameter of the bone canal reducing the amount of pressure applied to the bone.  A number of sizes of tapered hollow reamers are available along with their shafts and modular pilots so that the surgeon can choose\nprogressively larger hollow tapered reamers for a fresh bone canal or a reworked bone canal.  Since the low cost tapered hollow reamer 22 is disposable, the cutting performance of the hollow reamer is not compromised through repeated use.  Several\nlimitations of the prior art reamers and consequent clinical problems seen are overcome through utilization of the disposable modular tapered hollow reamers herein.  Novel design features of the hollow reamers of the present invention and improvements to\nprior art reamers are multifaceted.  The design includes a low cost disposable hollow tapered reamer 22 with a central poured or injection molded polymeric portion and reusable shaft 21 with two or more lateral tabs 21c engaging with corresponding slots\nin the poured or injection molded polymeric portion of the low cost disposable tapered hollow reamer.  The distal end of the shaft is threaded at 21b with a thread engaging a modular pilot 25.  During this attachment, end plates 23 and 24 are inserted to\ncontain bone fragments and bone cement debris.  The shaft has a driver coupling 21a (shown as a Jacob chuck connector).  The shaft 21 is attached to a drill at 21c.  A number of shaft sizes can be selected from a kit and the shaft size is indicated in a\nshaft marking.  The modular pilot 25 may carry indicia representing a shaft size to which it may be connected.  Moreover, when dealing with revision hip surgery, the hollow reamers have also been designed to cut bone cement (PMMA) in a more efficient\nmanner by providing internal space within the low cost tapered hollow reamer to capture the debris.  This feature reduces both the cutting temperature and time required to remove the remnant cement mantle.  The bone debris collected may be used for bone\ngrafting or other specific surgical procedures.  A further advantage of the hollow design is that by allowing the removal of the bone debris from the outer surface of the reamer to the inside of the reamer, the reamer is less likely to raise the\nintramedulary pressure in the long bone being reamed, thereby lessening the chance of fat embolism during these procedures.\n FIG. 3 depicts at 30 the mechanical details of the low cost modular disposable tapered hollow reamer according to the first embodiment of the invention in three views FIG. 3a, FIG. 3b and FIG. 3c.  FIG. 3a illustrates a metallic cutting sleeve\n31 that has cutting protrusions 31a extending from the outer surface.  Apertures 31b allow bone fragments and bone cement debris cut to enter the interior hollow portion of the sleeve 31.  Several of the cutters in specific locations have protrusions 31c\nextending into the hollow interior of the metallic sleeve.  These protrusions 31c engage with poured or injected polymer 32 of FIG. 3b to permanently anchor the metallic cutting sleeve to the poured or injection molded polymeric portion thereby providing\ntorque transmission between the poured or injected polymer portion and the hollow metallic sleeve 31.  As shown at 32 of FIG. 3b, the injection molding of the polymer is prevented from reaching the hollow metallic sleeve in several locations forming\nchannels 32a that provide a space for collecting bone debris.  FIG. 3c shows at 33 the low cost disposable tapered hollow reamer in the manufactured state as it is provided to a customer.  The figure shows no protrusions of the cutting elements in the\nchannel regions, while optionally, these protrusions may be present in each and every one of the cutting elements.  The polymeric sleeve and the poured or injection molded polymer is a medically compatible resin such as an acetyl resin or a polysulfone\nresin.  The polymeric portion has a central aperture 33a drilled to receive a reusable shaft.  On the opposite side, (not shown) the polymeric portion has two or more slots machined to engage with the torque transmitting tabs (21c of FIG. 2) of the\nshaft.\n FIG. 4 depicts at 40 the mechanical details of the low cost modular disposable tapered hollow reamer according to the second embodiment of the invention in five views FIG. 4a, FIG. 4b, FIG. 4c, FIG. 4d and FIG. 4e.  This mechanical design is\nsimilar to that disclosed in FIG. 3, but uses a polymeric sleeve with inserted cutting elements prior to pouring or injection molding of the polymeric portion instead of using metallic cutting sleeve.  FIG. 4a illustrates a plurality of manufactured\ncutting elements 41 that have cutting protrusions 41a, characterized by the presence of an upward pointing cutting protrusion and a downward pointing anchoring protrusion attached to a ring member 41c.  FIG. 4b schematically illustrates a conical hollow\npolymeric sleeve 42 with a plurality of apertures 42a.  FIG. 4c illustrates insertion of cutting elements inserted into apertures along a line as shown, with the cutting elements 41a protruding along the outer surface of the polymeric sleeve, while the\ndownward pointing anchoring protrusions of the cutting elements point inward towards the hollow center of the polymeric sleeve as shown.  FIG. 4d shows the general shape of the poured or injection molded polymeric portion that fills in the hollow portion\nof the polymeric sleeve.  FIG. 4e shows the manufactured low cost disposable tapered hollow reamer according to the second embodiment of the invention.  The ridges 44a of the poured or injection molded polymeric portion contact the anchoring protrusions\nof the inserted cutting elements 41, while the portions of the poured or injection molded polymer portion are excluded in areas 44b forming a channel that serves as a space for collecting bone fragments or bone cement debris.  Note that this channel is\ndirectly below the apertures in the polymeric sleeve.  The polymeric sleeve and the poured or injection molded polymer is a medically compatible resin such as an acetyl resin or a polysulfone resin.  The polymeric portion has a central aperture 33a\ndrilled to receive a reusable shaft.  On the opposite side, (not shown) the polymeric portion has two or more slots machined to engage with the torque transmitting tabs (21c of FIG. 2) of the shaft.\n FIG. 5 illustrates at 50 the manufacturing process for the low cost disposable hollow reamer of the present invention in two views FIG. 5a and FIG. 5b.  FIG. 5a illustrates at 51 an injection molding machine or a polymer pouring machine.  The\nmachine has two plates 51a and 51b clamping tightly a metallic cutter sleeve 22.  The sleeve has a plurality of cutting teeth 31a protruding outward from its external surface, apertures 31b and attachment protrusions 31c pointing into the hollow portion\nof the sleeve.  The polymer in this portion forms a ridge connecting the polymer portion with the metallic cutter sleeve at the anchoring attachment protrusions.  Several removable bars 52 (only one shown for simplicity) is inserted at locations where\nonly apertures 31b are present to create a space for colleting bone fragments or bone cement debris and is removed along the direction of the arrows shown.  The polymer 53 enters through the port 54 filling the mold to form the low cost disposable hollow\ntapered reamer.  FIG. 5b which depicts the manufactured low cost disposable hollow tapered reamer according to the first embodiment of the invention and the bar 52 is withdrawn before removing the manufactured part from the mold.  The method of\nmanufacture according to the second embodiment is exactly similar except that the polymeric sleeve is first fitted with cutting elements and inserted into the mold in exactly in the same manner and the removable bars positioned at the apertures where no\ncutting elements are present.\n Multiple disposable tapered hollow sleeves can be attached to a single shaft.  Preferably, a single shaft will attach to at least three different sized low cost disposable hollow cutters.  This provides for the ability to combine various sized\nshafts with various sized disposable hollow cutter assemblies.  These reusable reamer shafts have a coupling on the proximal end and a threaded portion in the distal end.  Each reusable shaft has two or more torque transmitting tabs for receiving the\nslots of the low cost disposable tapered hollow reamer, as shown in FIG. 2, and a threaded portion at the distal end for retaining the modular pilot in accordance with the invention.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n",

 'patent_description': u'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a bone plate system and apparatus for bending bone plates; and more particularly, to a system that comprises readily formable bone plates and a bending and configuring tower designed to create a bone plate shape\nthat matches a template.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Many patents address issues related to bone plates and apparatus for bending bone plates.  Some of the patents relate to bone plates for human use while others relate to bone plates for canine use.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 2,737,835 to Herz discloses tools for bonding plates in bone surgery.  A flat plate is bent at a suitable location using a bending tool.  As shown above in FIG. 4, three Smith-Petersen nails are inserted in one of the broken\nfemur bones and a fourth nail is inserted into the femoral shaft to rigidly hold the broken bones in place without movement, to promote bone healing.  The plate used is a two-dimensional object.  It does not completely support the three dimensional bone\nsegments that have fractured; but relies on the nails to prevent movement of the bone plate.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,866,458 to Wagner discloses a bender for contouring surgical implants.  The bender has a pair of bending tools, one of which is specifically adapted for use in bending a particular hip fixation plate and the other of which is\nadaptable for use on bending a wide variety of metallic surgical implants including a hip fixation plate.  The first of the benders has an elongated handle portion conforming to the femur shaft and a flat bowl-shaped head portion conforming to the lower\nportion of the greater trochanter of a femur.  The head portion has at least one transversing bore for receiving a hip screw.  The first bender is designed to grip the head portion of the plate.  It has an upper jaw and a lower jaw pivotally\ninterconnected at one end.  A swing bolt and wing nut are disposed on the other end.  The inner surface of one of the jaws has one or more nipples for registering with transverse bores of the head portion.  The inner surface of the other jaw is adapted\nto close against the side of the head portion facing it.  An elongated handle is rigidly attached to the bottom of the lower jaw for gripping purposes.  The second bender may be used to grip any generally flat implant having opposed sides.  It has a\nhousing with a channel extending longitudinally through it.  One side of the channel is contoured to conform to the contour of one of the opposed sides of the implant.  A jaw member is disposed within the channel.  The jaw member is adapted for vertical\nmovement, which raises and lowers the jaw member within the channel.  An elongated handle extends from the housing for gripping purposes.  The second bender is used by sliding the implant into the channel in the space between its one side and the jaw\nmember.  The jaw member is raised until the implant is clamped between it and one side of the channel.  The bone plate disclosed by the \'458 patent is clearly not suitable for multiple purposes.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,965,720 to Goodwm et al. discloses a hinge adjustment tool.  This hinge adjustment tool is designed for use on self-closing hinges for kitchen cabinets.  The hinge has the form of a bar of hot rolled steel.  End portions of the\nbar are displaced out of the plane of the bar\'s intermediate portion.  Such displacement is produced in opposite directions at an angle of about 45.degree.  by a cold bending operation.  The end portions are provided with a slot opening facing in\nopposite directions, and with the end portions of the hinge tool hardened by heat treatment.  This hinge is designed for self-closing kitchen cabinets.  The ends of the hinge bar are bent in opposite directions, and are provided with slots facing the\nopposite direction.  This hinge adjustment tool has a structure and function distinctly different from a multi-purpose bone plate for orthopedic applications.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,113,685 to Asher et al. discloses an apparatus for contouring spine plates and/or rods.  A plurality of instruments or members plastically deform spine plates or rods to a configuration, which corresponds to a desired\nconfiguration for connection to a spinal column.  A pair of flat benders having slots are engageable with a spine plate to bend and/or twist the spine plate.  A pair of tube benders is engageable with a rod to bend the rod.  One of the flat benders may\nbe used with one of the tube benders to form a bend in the rod.  In addition, the two flat benders may be used together to bend the rod.  These instruments make possible two-dimensional bending of spine plates and three-dimensional bending of spine rods. The spinal plate disclosed by the \'685 patent is not a bone plate.  It is not used to fix broken bone; but rather keeps the spinal column in a desired position.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,564,302 to Watrous discloses orthopedic bone plate bending irons.  The orthopedic bone plate bending irons comprise a simple machine that permits the application of a concentrated bending moment to a stiff metallic bone plate. \nThe bends are accomplished along three orthogonal torsional axes, enabling a modest sized operator to bend the most stout bone plates.  The bending moments are transmitted to the bone plates through the edges of curved apertures, so that the built in\ntransverse curvature of the plate is not crushed with resulting weakening of the plate.  Finally, the apertures are rotated and angled to provide comfortable hand clearance and to permit efficient application of muscle force by the operator.  The bone\nplate is inserted into angled slots in a pair of irons and the distal end of the irons is moved to bend the bone plate.  The bending action only bends the overall plate and portions of the plate cannot be contoured to fit a three-dimensional fractured\nbone.  There is no template provided to adjust bending and twisting in accordance with surgical requirements.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,746,742 to Runciman et al. discloses a bone plate template.  This bone plate template is composed of 1100-0 aluminum.  It comprises reduced width connecting sections that have a width to thickness ratio of 1.6:1 to 1.4:1, so\nthat these connecting sections may be manually bent or twisted without forming folds or kinks.  The template disclosed by the \'742 patent is not a template for a symmetrical bone plate; it cannot be used in both left handed and right-handed conditions. \nAfter the bone plate template is bent to desired shape, the actual bone plate must be bent by application of a large amount of force.  This procedure causes the bone plate template with the desired shape to be bent out of shape during the bending\noperation of the actual bone plate.  The template disclosed by the \'742 patent is only a template; and provides no disclosure for bending a bone plate.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,904,684 to Rooks discloses a device and method for simultaneous bilateral pelvic osteotomies.  This method and device facilitates the procedure of a transverse osteotomy of both ilium and a secondary osteotomy through the\npelvic symphysis.  A plate is utilized which has facility for attachment of eight screws into the, animal bone tissue to more securely hold the plate in place.  The shape of the plate represents a significant advance and has important characteristics. \nOnly one side of the plate has sharply angled surfaces to accommodate rotated pelvic bone portions, while the other side of the plate is smooth and facilitates a more stable direct insertion of the bone screws.  In this configuration, the bores can\nclosely match the shapes of the heads of the bone screws and provide less exposed material at the outside of the plate.  The plate is adapted to be bent.  More than ample material is provided to bend the plate along its axis to facilitate insertion of\nbone screws at right angles to the extent of the pelvic bone tissue.  The bone plate has two wedge shaped elements, which are twisted and bent according to surgical requirements.  It is not symmetrical, and cannot be interchangeably used for the left\nside and right side before bending.  The bone plate is made of solid metal and cannot be easily bent into three-dimensional shapes.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,968,047 to Reed discloses a fixation device.  A sterile bone fixation device in the form of a screw, pin or bone plate is made from sterile animal or human bone.  Perforations are provided on the surface for improved bone\nbonding.  The bone plate disclosed by the \'047 patent is not bendable, and cannot be easily shaped to conform to the three dimensionality of a fractured bone.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,077,271 to Huebner et al. discloses a bone plate vise.  The vise is provided as an aid in bending a bone plate.  The vise includes an elongate handle and a first clamp mechanism.  The clamp mechanism includes a plate-receiving\nslot having an axis perpendicular to the long axis of the handle and rotationally fixed to the handle.  The clamp mechanism also includes a moveable jaw bordering the plate-receiving slot.  A jaw tightening mechanism urges the moveable jaw against a bone\nplate positioned in the plate-receiving slot to thereby secure the plate in the vise.  The bone plate is inserted into the vice and is clamped securely.  The free end of the bone plate is bent or twisted using a bending iron.  There are no provisions to\ncontrol the location of the bend or twist or the amount of bend or twist.  Since the wider portion of the bone plate is within the bone vice, it cannot be contoured to conform to the three dimensional shape of a bone.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,712,073 to Manderson discloses an extramedullary rod implant for long bones.  A method for inserting a solid rod implant into the body is detailed by the \'073 patent.  The implant is designed for bridging two portions of a\nbroken long bone, and maintaining the divided portions of the bone in stable alignment with each other.  The solid rod implant is rigidly attached to the damaged long bone by a pair of partly tubular plates at either end of the rod.  These plates provide\nthe sole means of attachment of the implant to the bone.  That is, there is no provision for any attachments along, beside or through any portion of the rod that would allow it to be attached to any portion of the bone providing support for\nosteosynthesis.  By its design and method of rigid attachment to the bone through partly tubular end plates, the implant allows controlled motion at the fractured or non-united portions of the bone fragments.  This motion stimulates rapidly forming\nexternal bridging callus formation for osteosynthesis of the long bone, a process that shortens the time of osteosynthesis of long bones so treated.  This long implant is attached further from the bone fracture region using screws.  The arrangement\nallows gentle movement at the fracture, which is said to promote the healing process.  The shape of the implant rod and the attachment points are not contoured three dimensionally according to the shape of the bone.  In fact, the fractured portion of the\nbone is not surgically disturbed and the implant is not set against the fractured bone.\n U.S.  Patent Application No. 2003/0055435 to Barrick discloses an orthopedic implant shaper.  This implant shaper system consists of a flexible fiber optic curvature sensor device, a computer, and an implant-shaping machine.  The flexible fiber\noptic curvature sensor device is a tape used to determine the required three-dimensional shape of an orthopaedic implant.  The sterilized tape is applied to the fractured bone in surgery once it is reduced.  The shapes and sizes of various metal\northopaedic implants are stored on the hard disc of the computer in a lookup table file.  The operator inputs the type of implant to be contoured and the number of holes of a plate or length of a rod.  The digitized contour of the tape is then matched\nwith the particular bone implant.  The information is transmitted to the implant-shaping machine to program the settings for the actual contouring.  The implant-shaping machine consists of a series of opposing hydraulic cylinders with dies arranged in\nrows on rocking platforms.  Each unit consists of a pair of opposing hydraulic cylinders that work reciprocally to move dies in relation to the metal fixation implant.  In this invention, a fiber optic tape curvature sensor is placed on a bone that is\nfractured.  The fiber optic tape is illuminated; the curvature of the tape placed on the bone is detected; and the information is sent to a computer, which controls implant-shaping machine.  The implant is a machined device matching the exact dimension\nof bone curvature as detected by a fiber optic sensor tape.  The strength of the implant, its biocompatibility and its means of attachment to fractured bone is not disclosed.\n U.S.  Patent Application No. 2004/0116934 discloses a tool system for adapting a bone plate.  The tool system is for working on a bone plate and includes a first tool and a second tool.  Both tools are used at the same time to shorten or bend\nthe bone plate.  The tool system for adapting bone plates is provided with a first tool having a first and a second introduction opening for bone plates, and a second tool having a third and a fourth introduction opening for bone plates.  For cutting the\nbone plate, the bone plate is arranged in the first and third introduction openings, and for bending it is arranged in the second and fourth introduction openings.  One or more of the introduction openings may be of closable construction in order to\nenable a bone plate which is to be worked on to be received such that it cannot come free.  The two tools are used at the same time when shortening or bending the bone plate.  This tool has an opening for cutting or shortening a bone plate and openings\nfor bending the bone plate.  The bone plate can only be cut at the ends of the bone plate and the bending movement is possible with the ends clamped by the tool.  The precise location of the bend in the bone plate cannot be adjusted.  The bone plate\ndisclosed by the \'934 application cannot be bent to a three-dimensional shape.\n There remains a need in the art for a method and means for three dimensionally bending bone plates to provide three-dimensional support to fractured bone segments, thereby retaining the surgeon-set position of the bones during the bone-healing\nperiod.  There is also a need for shaped bone plates that are suited for canine use; which can accommodate the small size of canine bone segments; which can be implanted so that the mobility of the operated animal is maintained immediately after surgery. Further needed is a bone plate system that provides intimate contact between fractured bone segments during the healing period, so that a long-term permanent bond between the implant and the underlying bone structure is made possible and extended motion\nmeeting the canine needs can be achieved.  Still further there is needed a bone plate system wherein the implanted bone plate is not removed during the remaining lifetime of the dog, and continues to function flawlessly without corrosion or rejection\nreactions throughout its service life.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a method and means for three dimensionally bending bone plates to provide three-dimensional support to fractured bone segments, thereby retaining the surgeon-set position of the bones during the bone-healing\nperiod.  Shaped bone plates provided in accordance with the present invention are especially suited for canine use.  Such bone plates can accommodate the small size of canine bone segments.  They can be implanted so that the mobility of the operated\nanimal is maintained immediately after surgery.  Advantageously, the bone plate system of this invention provides intimate contact between fractured bone segments during the healing period.  A long-term permanent bond between the implant and the\nunderlying bone structure is effected, and extended motion meeting the canine needs is achieved.  Once implanted, the bone plate is not removed during the remaining lifetime of the dog.  It is highly reliable in operation, and functions continuously in\nthe implanted condition without corrosion or rejection reactions throughout its service life.\n Generally stated, the multipurpose bone plate system of this invention comprises: a series of symmetrical bone plates having angulation and compression slots that enables easy bending of the bone plate.  This symmetrical bone plate may be used\nfor either the left side or the right side of an animal.  A sterile malleable trial template in the shape of a bone plate made from annealed stainless steel, annealed copper, annealed aluminum, polymer sheet and the like is used to first create a bone\nplate template using the actual bone shape of the animal in surgery.  This template is then removed from the actual bone of the animal in surgery, and inserted into an ergonomic bending and contouring tower.  The bending and contouring tower has\nangulation slots and compression slots at various locations to bend a bone plate using angulation and compression tools.  These angulation and compression slots of the bending and contouring tower are adjusted using the bone plate template, and set in\naccordance with its geometrical requirements.  Bending and contouring a bone plate is accomplished by using specialized bending and contouring tools which work together with the angulation and compression slot of the bending and contouring tower, the\npositions of which have been set by using the bone plate template.  The resulting three-dimensionally contoured bend plate surrounds the fractured bone of the animal in surgery due to the accurate bending and contouring thereof.  Attachment of the\nthree-dimensionally shaped bone plate to the fractured bone is accomplished by screws or nails driven through six apertures in the bone plate.\n The System includes bone plates having a thickness of 2.7 mm and 3.5 mm with multiple compression and angulation slots for easy bending of the bone plate.  The thicker plate is used for larger and heavier animals.  The bone plate is\nthree-dimensionally contoured in an easy to use bending and contouring tower and addresses the clinical needs of animals with various bone geometry using a single bone plate.  Due to the symmetrical shape of the one plate, the bone plate may be used for\nthe left or right side fractured bones.  The multiple applications of the system include, but are not limited to, pelvic osteotomy, ilial shaft fracture, proximal tibial osteotomy, distal radial fracture and partial carpal athrodesis.  The versatility of\nthe system minimizes the need to inventory a wide selection of plates and pins in order to address the varied requirements of clinical cases.\n The bone plate of the system is symmetrical, has a combination of angulation and compression slots, and can be bent into either left or right components.  The multipurpose bone plate is manufactured from 316 LVM stainless steel--a standard\nmaterial for surgical implants, which provides a high degree of effectiveness, as evidenced by its clinical history and laboratory testing data.  Deviations from this standard can impact product strength, biocompatibility and corrosion resistance.\n The method of using the multi-purpose bone plate system comprises the following steps: 1) the surgeon inserts the sterile malleable bone plate template to surround the fractured bone segment; 2) the malleable bone plate is deformed by fingers\nuntil it surrounds the fractured bone; 3) the bone plate template is removed from the fractured bone; 4) the three-dimensionally shaped bone plate template is inserted into the bending and contouring tower; 5) the angulation and compression slots of the\ncontouring and bending tower are adjusted to match the three dimensional shape of the bone plate template by inserting alignment pins; 6) the bone plate template is removed from the bending and contouring tower; 7) a bone plate is inserted into the\nbending and contouring tower; 8) the bone plate is three-dimensionally shaped using bending irons and bend and twist adapters to create a shape that is the same as the bone plate template; 9) the bending and contouring tower is bent with the\nthree-dimensionally shaped bone plate into a flash sterilizing unit; 10) the sterile three-dimensionally shaped bone plate is removed from the bending and contouring tower and the bone plate is incorporated on the fractured bone. BRIEF\nDESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n The invention will be more fully understood and further advantages will become apparent when reference is had to the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings, in which:\n FIG. 1a is a photograph depicting two bone plates having a thickness of 2.7 mm and 3.5 mm;\n FIG. 1b is a photograph of a bone plate at a higher magnification illustrating the angulation slots and compression slots;\n FIG. 2 illustrates radiographs of a bond fracture anchored with a bone plate and six screws;\n FIG. 3a illustrates a bending and contouring tower and its components; and\n FIG. 3b illustrates the operation of the bending and twisting of a bone plate using the bending and contouring tower.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n The present invention provides a method and means bending bone plates in three dimensions to provide multi-dimensional support to fractured bone segments.  Such multi-dimensional support facilitates retention of the surgeon-set position of the\nbones during the bone-healing period.  Shaped bone plates provided in accordance with the present invention are especially suited for canine use.  Such bone plates can accommodate the small size of canine bone segments.  They can be implanted so that the\nmobility of the operated animal is maintained immediately after surgery.  An intimate contact between fractured bone segments is provided during the healing period.  A long-term, permanent bond between the implant and the underlying bone structure is\nachieved.  This long-term, permanent bond affords extended motion, thereby meeting canine needs.  Once implanted, the bone plate is not removed during the remaining lifetime of the dog.  It is highly reliable in operation, and functions continuously in\nthe implanted condition without corrosion or rejection reactions throughout its service life.\n In traumas involving bone fractures and osteotomies, it is oftentimes necessary to re-orient alignment between bone segments.  Bone plates and screws have been used for decades to obtain this result.  Such bone plates and screws are used at the\nfracture/osteotomy site to stabilize the segments of bone and to allow the normal healing process to take place.  Bone segment stabilization is critical to the healing process, as it prevents non-union caused by micro motion between the bone segments.\n The bone plate and screws must achieve fixation to each bony segment and then must provide for compression at the fracture/osteotomy site.  Because bones have complex outer geometries, many bone plates have been designed for different\nindications, and are provided with given designs in left and right configurations.  Notwithstanding the seemingly wide array of bone plates found in the prior art, bending or contouring of bone plates is still required in order to better fit the exterior\ncortex of the bone over the fracture site.  This bending is typically accomplished with bending irons that grab the ends of the plate, thereby allowing the surgeon to bend and twist the bone plate in various directions to fit the bone.  Generally, two\nbending irons are provided.  With one bending iron in each hand loosely holding the plate at either end, the plate is bent and/or twisted in an approximate manner based on the surgeon\'s visual interpretation of the outer geometry of the bone.  This\nprocess can be time consuming and oftentimes involves a trial and error process with the plate being bent, trial fitted to the bone, bent again, and so forth, until an adequate fit is established.\n The present invention provides a bone plate system having certain design objectives and advantages, which include: 1.  a bone plate design capable of addressing several different clinical indications owing to its ability to be properly contoured\nthrough use of angulation or compression slots disposed at suitably designed locations; 2.  a bone plate design capable of addressing both left and right bones because of its ability to be properly contoured; 3.  sufficient sizes within the bone plate\ndesign for application with different size/weight animals; 4.  means for accurately contouring the bone plates intraoperatively; 5.  means for contouring the bone plates wherein less iterations are necessary in order to achieve an accurate fit to the\nbone; and 6.  an improved bending tower that can be disassembled and contained within the standard flash autoclave pan (11\'\'.times.7\'\'.times.1.4\'\'), thereby providing for immediate use of the instrument between cases (following flash autoclaving).\n With the design objectives met, the system of the present invention comprises a versatile bone plate system that addresses a multitude of clinical indications within one plate system.  The design of the bone plates, together with an accurate\nmethod of contouring them, permits it to be used in a wide variety of applications.  Significantly, the system affords significant financial benefits to a veterinarian practice.  Usually different plate designs, some of which are designed for left\nconfigurations and others of which are designed for right configurations, are needed to address clinical cases such as TPLO, TPO, iliac shaft fractures and certain bone fusion applications.  Not only are these different designs needed for these different\nindications, but multiple bone plate sizes are also required within each design.  A bone plate system having a basic bone plate design for addressing a relatively small number of bone sizes, and an accurate method for contouring the plates, enables the\nsurgeon to address a given population of clinical cases with a far smaller bone plate inventory.\n Bone plates are commonly used to anchor bone segments having a bone fracture therein.  The bone plate is attached to the bones by means of a multitude of screws or nails, which hold the bone segments in contact with each other at the fracture\nlocation.  Since the bone plate provides the mechanical stability and the ability to apply load to the bone, the normal functioning of the animal treated is made possible even during the time period within which the bone fracture joint is healing.  The\nbone plate and screws may be surgically removed after the bone healing process is complete, or left within the animal body.  In either case, the bone plate is within the animal for at least three months (a typical bone healing period) or longer.\n Key requirements for a bone plate include, in combination: 1) the ability to be readily attached to fractured bone segments; 2) fastening capability adequate to attach the bone plate to the bone segments, i.e. an adequate number of provisions\nfor fasteners; 3) mechanical bone plate strength adequate to withstand applied loading without excessive deformation at the bone fracture joint; 4) corrosion resistance adequate to withstand body fluids during the remaining lifetime of the animal; and 5)\nbio-compatibility adequate to prevent rejection reactions of the bone plate.  When a bone plate is used during surgery, it must have a shape appropriate to provide support; yet possess sterility sufficient to prevent the possibility of infection.\n The present invention provides a multipurpose bone plate system having a bone plate thickness from about 2.7 mm to 3.5 mm to match the requirements of differently sized dogs.  The bone plates are inherently symmetrical, and the ergonomic bending\ntower comprising a component of the system enables exceedingly accurate bending of these bone plates to three-dimensional shapes that better fit the requirements of bone support.  The three dimensionally shaped bone plates are inserted during surgery to\nprovide improved support for fractured bones so that the fracture location is completely immobilized, enhancing opportunity for the fractured area to promote bone growth.  During this healing period, the animal is not immobilized and continues normal\nactivity due to the support provided by the three-dimensionally shaped bone plate.\n The bone plate is inserted by the surgeon.  It surrounds the fractured bone and stays within the animal body for a substantial time period, typically greater than three months.  Accordingly, the bone plate should be biocompatible and should not\nresult in rejection reactions.  The bone plates are composed of 316 LVM stainless steel.  Surgical implantability of this steel composition is well established.  The 316 LVM stainless alloy steel exhibits high strength, biocompatibility and corrosion\nresistance.\n The bending tower comprises a series of angulation and compression slots that are positioned to create appropriate twisting capability for shaping a bone plate to match differently sized and shaped animals.  The surgeon first evaluates his shape\nrequirements by creating a multidimensional template that fits the requirements of a particular bone being operated on.  The template is inserted into the bending tower and the angulations and compression slots are set to match the multidimensional\ntemplate.  A symmetrical bone plate is then inserted into the bending tower, wherein it is bent and twisted, using bend and twist bars, to create a three dimensional shape that essentially matches the shape of the multidimensional template.  Once the\nsurgeon is satisfied with the shape of the bone plate, the three dimensionally shaped bone plate is inserted back into the bending tower and flash sterilized, together with screws or nails, in a standard flash autoclaving pan, the dimensions of which are\ntypically about 11\'\'.times.7\'\' and 1.4\'\'.  At this point, the bone plate is ready for insertion surrounding the fractured bone sections.  This is where I stopped.\n The multipurpose bone plate system of the present invention ("the System") is composed of (i) a series of symmetrical bone plates, wherein separate plates for left and right configurations, respectively, are not required; (ii) malleable trial\nplate templates; and (iii) an ergonomic bending tower which provides for accurate bending and contouring of the bone plates.  The bone plates are designed to allow for bending in order to provide for both left and right applications; the bone plates are\noffered in several sizes in order to provide clinical applications in a multitude of areas.  In order to improve the fit of the bone plate to the bone, malleable templates are provided in the shape of the bone plates.  The templates can be contoured to\nthe bone and then used as a template in order to appropriately contour the actual bone plate.  The bending tower provides for a stable set-up in order to easily bend and/or twist a bone plate and also to provide for alignment checks.  The ease and\naccuracy of the bending tower in combination with the malleable templates significantly reduces the iterative process to fit the plate to the bone.  In addition, with these bending options and the design of the bone plates, a multitude of clinical\napplications can be addressed with one design.  Applications with the bone plates in conjunction with the bending tower include TPLO (Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy), TPO (Triple Pelvic Osteotomy), iliac shaft fractures, partial carpal arthrodesis,\nproximal tibial osteotomy, and distal radial fracture.\n FIG. 1a photograph illustrates at 10 two bone plates having a thickness of 2.7 mm and 3.5 mm with 3 holes or apertures in the right hand side and three holes or apertures on the left hand side for affixing the bone to sections of a broken bone. \nThe bone plate is entirely symmetrical and in particular the left hand side of the bone plate has two lobes, which may be bent to accommodate a left hand or right hand bone section.  Bending of this bone plate creates a three-dimensional bone plate that\nsurrounds the broken bone, providing anchoring and stability.  The bone plate is screwed-on or nailed-in using the six holes or apertures of the bone plate.\n FIG. 1b illustrates at 20 the bone plate at a higher magnification.  It shows six holes or apertures for accepting anchoring screws or nails and a number of slots placed at several strategic locations designed to permit easy bending or twisting\nof the bone plate.  The angulation slots are shown at 21.  The compression slots are shown at 22.  The portion of the bone plate in the region 23 is narrowed to facilitate easy bending of the bone plate.  The bone plate is made from 316 LVM stainless\nsteel.  The symmetrical lobe of the bone plate is shown at 24.  The bone plate is bent along line XX to produce a three-dimensional shape.  The presence of these slots allows the surgeon to bend the bone plate into a three dimensional shape that matches\na bone that is being operated on.\n FIG. 2 illustrates the radiographs of a bone fracture with bone plate anchored using six screws.  The first radiograph shows two views of a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy.  The second radiograph shows two views of an ilial shaft fracture\nmended by a bone plate.  The third radiograph shows partial carpal arthrodeis.  In all cases, the bone plate appears white since the stainless steel bone plate absorbs more of the x-rays as compared to the bone.\n FIG. 3a illustrates the bending and contouring tower, its components.  The bending and contouring tower is provided with generic bending and twisting tools, a bending iron, alignment pins and a series of pliable templates.  The surgeon bends the\ntemplates according to the shape of the bone plate desired.  The alignment pins allow the setting of bending and twisting movements required to accomplish this multi-dimensional bone plate geometry.  The twisting and bending slots in the bending and\ncontouring tower are aligned according to the desired shape of the template.  The bone plate is inserted into the bending and contouring tower and is bent using the bending iron and generic and twisting adapters.\n FIG. 3b illustrates the operation of bending and twisting of the bone plate using the bending and contouring tower.  The slots present in the bone plate as illustrated in FIG. 1b make the bending and twisting possible.\n The key features of the multi-purpose bone plate system are: 1.  a bone plate design which can address several different clinical indications because of its ability to be properly contoured, matching the bone in three dimensions due to the\npresence of specially designed angulation or compression slots within the bone plate; 2.  a bone plate design which can address both left and right bones because of its ability to be properly contoured; 3.  sufficient sizes within the bone plate design\nfor application with different size/weight animals; 4.  means for accurately contouring the bone plates intraoperatively; 5.  means for contouring the bone plates wherein less iterations are necessary in order to achieve an accurate fit to the bone; and\n6.  an improved bending tower that can be disassembled and contained within a standard flash autoclave pan (11\'\'.times.7\'\'.times.1.4\'\'), thereby providing for immediate use of the instrument between cases (following flash autoclaving).\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a modular easy-to-assemble low cost sheet metal formed disposable modular spherical hollow reamer assembly for medical applications that has a bone fragment and bone debris capturing cavity, and can be attached\nconcentric to a reusable shaft.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  These procedures include hip replacement and shoulder replacement, and the like.  Reamers are used in procedures that involve creation of\nacetabular bone cavities that accept a properly sized acetabular cups.  Prior art reamers typically fall into two major classes: rigid and flexible shaft.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone cavity is achieved through utilization of a spherical\nreamer some having provisions for discharging and collecting reamed bone fragments.  Spherical reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and\nstronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the acetabular cavity for a proper fit of the acetabular cup.  Conventional spherical reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the\nreamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient friction/heat to damage or kill the surrounding bone.  These prior art solid spherical reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore\nbecome less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  These dull blades also incorporate bone debris or bone cement debris into the living bone tissue, creating bone healing problems and fixation of an\nimplanted acetabular cup.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,116,200 to Braun et al. discloses a milling tool for surgical purposes.  This surgical milling tool is operated with a hand-operated milling machine for milling the heads or sockets of bone joints of a spherical shape.  The\ntool is formed of a hemispherical cup integrally formed with a cylindrical skirt and flange and is provided with a plurality of openings of semi-oval shape, each having a cutting edge arranged at the minor axis of the oval shape.  The openings are\nsituated such that, upon rotation of the cup, the cutting edges thereof overlap to provide a continuous cutting edge surface conforming generally to the shape of the cup.  The formation of fine bone shavings is avoided by use of this milling tool.  The\nsurgical milling tool utilizes a integrally formed hemispherical cup having a plurality of openings appointed with cutting edges for milling sockets of bone joints.  The hemispherical shape of cup provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of\nthe bone joints.  Bone and cartilage shavings are formed during the milling process and are collected in a border area inside of the hemispherical cup.  The surgical milling tool is provided for multiple use and is not a disposable spherical hollow\nreamer, and therefore the tool will become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,811,632 to Salyer discloses surgical reamer.  a method of producing an acetabular reamer cup.  This method comprises the steps of fabricating a bowl-shaped cup-blank having an outer surface, an inner surface and a rim,\nperforating a plurality of holes through the cup-blank, the holes each being surrounded by a margin, deforming outwardly a cutting portion of the margin of each of the holes, smoothing the outer surface of the cup-blank to sharpen the deformed cutting\nportions, raising cutting edges from the cutting portions and removing the rim.  The cutting edges are disposed to cut upon rotation of the acetabular reamer.  The cup manufactured by this method is preferred because of its improved strength and\nconsistently superior cutting edges.  The acetabular reamer utilizes a hemispherical or bowl-shaped cup having a spherical construction and a plurality cutting openings for milling sockets of joints.  The hemispherical shape of reamer provides the\nability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the bone joints.  The acetabular reamer is provided for multiple use, and therefore the tool will become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,100,267 and its continuation in part U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,299,893 to Salyer disclose a disposable acetabular reamer cup.  The disposable acetabular reamer cup has a cutting bowl having a plurality of cutting edges.  The cutting\nbowl has perforations adjoining the cutting edges.  The cutting bowl defines an axis of rotation.  The cutting bowl has a bottom opening.  A transparent polymeric plug is joined to the cutting bowl.  The plug is concentric with the axis of rotation.  It\noccupies the bottom opening; and has a tool driver opening concentric with the axis of rotation.  When a torque is applied, the bowl is turned with respect to the plug, which means that the cutting torque is transmitted through the plug and transferred\nto the cutting plug through the detents.  There is no direct connection between the shaft and the cutting bowl other than through the plug.  Concentricity of the cutting bowl with respect to that of the shaft is therefore not assured.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,116,165 to Salyer discloses an acetabular reamer cup.  This acetabular reamer cup comprises a cutting bowl having a plurality of singly curved cutting edges.  The cutting bowl has a plurality of slots preceding the cutting\nedges.  The cutting bowl defines an axis of rotation.  A bottom is joined to the cutting bowl.  The bottom has a tool driver opening concentric with the axis of rotation.  With a right handed acetabular reamer cup that cuts when pressed against a\nsubstrate and rotated in a clockwise direction, slots are positioned to the right of respective cutters.  There is no direct connection between the shaft and the cutting bowl other than through the base aperture.  The concentricity of the cutting bowl\nwith respect to that of the shaft is therefore not assured.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,302,234 to Grace, et al. discloses surgical cutting instrument forming method.  This surgical cutting instrument is a sheet metal tool that is not planar, and the tools is made from a sheet metal blank, which has a first\nsurface and an opposing second surface.  A etching resistant material is applied to the first surface and etched by a chemical etching agent to form a sharp edge that terminates on the second surface coated with a etch resistant material.  There is no\nindication how this non planer chemically etched tool is mounted concentrically on a shaft.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,658,290 to Lechot discloses an assembly comprising reamer spindle and reamer for surgery.  The reamer comprises a cap and at least three radial rods which are arranged uniformly on the inside edge of the cap and join up\nintegrally at the center of the cap.  The reamer spindle comprises a shank on which there is fixed a reamer spindle head that is equipped with a bayonet with locking means for the securing of the reamer.  The securing catches of the bayonet are intended\nto receive the radial rods of the reamer.  The connection between the reamer rods and bayonet does not provide a precise centerline matching arrangement.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,709,688, as well as U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,001,105, and 6,428,543 to Salyer disclose an acetabular reamer cup and method of producing the same.  This method for making an acetabular reamer cup for an acetabular reamer comprises\nthe steps of: fabricating a bowl shaped cup-blank having outer and inner bowl shaped surfaces, perforating a plurality of holes through the cup-blank, the holes each are surrounded by a curved margin, deforming outwardly of the outer surface a cutting\nportion of the margin of each of the holes, thereby forming cutting edges, the cutting portions are curved outwardly of the outer surface, the cutting edges are curved tangentially of the outer surface and disposed to cut upon rotation of the acetabular\nreamer.  An acetabular reamer cup is also provided with a cutting bowl having a plurality of curved cutting edges.  The cutting bowl has a plurality of openings preceding the cutting edges, and a generally conical rise following the cutting edges.  The\ncutting edges are spirally arranged about the axis of rotation of the cutting bowl, and a bottom adjoined to the cutting bowl.  The bottom has a tool driver opening coaxial with the cutting bowl and the cutting edges.  Bone debris collection compartment\nis located directly below the actabular reamer.  Bottom of the acetabular reamer has a tool driver opening, which is concentric with the cutting bowl.  The driver opening engages with the shaft, which drives the acetabular reamer.  This form of\nattachment of the shaft with the acetabular reamer does not ensure alignment of axis of the shaft with that of the acetabular reamer.  The acetabular reamer is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,755,719 to Frieze, et al. discloses an acetabular reamer.  This acetabular reamer includes a base, a first set of semi-circular blades attached to the base, and a second set of semi-circular blades also contacting said base,\nand crossing and intersecting with said first set of blades at right angles thereto.  The base preferably comprises a circular plate having a hexagonal drive hole in the center thereof and a plurality of slots in the periphery thereof for anchoring the\nblades.  Each semi-circular blade includes a first end having a projection thereon, a second end opposite from said first end and also having a projection thereon, a first edge having serrated cutting teeth thereon, a second edge opposite from said first\nedge, and a first and second side surface.  The cutting edge of the first set of blades includes a plurality of outwardly facing slots, which mate with and engage a second set of inwardly facing slots in the second edge of said second blades.  When the\nfirst and second set of blades are assembled in this fashion the cutting edges of both sets of blades lie in the same spherical plane.  The projections can comprise snap-in projections that automatically lock in position or projections that can be\ntwisted and locked into position.  Alternatively, the base can comprise a pair of upper and lower plates with apertures in the upper plate such that when the blade projections mate with the apertures, riveting of the lower plate with respect to the upper\nplate locks the projections and their related blades into position on the base.  When the reamer is assembled it has a hemispherical shape suitable for reaming the acetabulum of the hip so that the acetabular portion of a hip implant properly fits into\nthe acetabulum.  The acetabular reamer is an open structure and the bone fragments will migrate back into the cutting zone, since no containment space is formed by the open structure of the cutter blades inserted into the base.  The drive shaft is\ncoupled to a hexagonal aperture in the base plate.  This method of attachment does not align the hemispherical cutter centerline with that of the drive shaft.  As such, the arrangement causes wobbliness of the cutter in the bone cavity.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,976,144 to Fishbein et al. discloses a hollow dome reamer with removable teeth.  This surgical reamer has a hollow dome with apertures spaced apart arranged in arcs extending from an apex of the dome to the base portion of the\ndome.  Removable teeth are positioned in the apertures.  Each cutting tooth has a flange that is aligned flush with the external surface of the dome, and a raised cutting edge extending above the flange and the external surface of the dome.  An interior\npassageway communicates between the outside and inside of the dome.  A base plate is removably secured on the base portion of the dome to provide closure of the central cavity of the dome.  A perspective view of the cutter of the reamer is shown\nhereinbelow on the left; a perspective view of the reamer with removable, replaceable cutters is shown herein on the right.  The base plate is secured to the dome by retaining springs.  A drive shaft is connected to the base plate through an aperture in\nthe base plate and held in place by a spring.  The surgical reamer has a hollow dome with apertures spaced apart appointed to receive removable teeth positioned therein.  Although the teeth are removable, they are not disposable in nature; the teeth are\nremoved for replacement or for re-sharpening and are used again.  The dome is connected to a base plate, which is further connected to a shaft member and retained by a spring clip and an interlocking latch.  There is no direct attachment of the shaft to\nthe dome and this multitude of connections to the shaft does not assure that the centerline of the shaft coincides with that of the hollow dome.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,980,170 to Salyer as well as U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,817,096, 5,501,686, 5,282,804, 5,236,433, 5,171,313, 5,171,312 disclose a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is\nsecured at one of said shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool collate is secured at the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be\npositioned.  The boss has a distal end surface with a groove therein.  Both the groove and the distal end surface extend transversely of the axis.  A pin is positioned in the groove on the axis.  A latch mechanism is provided to hold a mounting bar of a\nrotary tool in the groove on the pin, whereby the rotary tool is held exactly coaxially of the driver during use.  The rotary tool, which is used with the driver has a bar which has the same dimensions as the groove in the boss of the tool driver of the\ninvention.  The bar thus fills the slot and is complementary to the slot.  The bar has a hole therein which is complementary to the pin.  The pin extends coaxially of the shaft and the boss.  The bar hole in which the pin of the tool driver is positioned\nis precisely coaxial of the axis of the tool about which the cutting edges are precisely positioned.  The tool driver has a shaft appointed to receive acetabular reamer cups and patella cutters.  The cutters are appointed to be connected to the tip of\nthe shaft by means of mounting bar in the cutter and a slot in the shaft secured by a complementary pin.  This method of attachment--using a mounting bar that slides into a slot--does not align the centerline of the shaft with that of the reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,168,600 to Grace, et al discloses an acetabular reamer backing plate and method of use.  The backing plate for an acetabular reamer assembly that has a planar surface allows for the attachment of a reamer driver.  The rigid\nbacking plate terminates in an outer circumferential edge, the outer circumferential edge being coupled to the peripheral bottom edge of the cutting cup.  The rigid plate has an internal edge profile that has at least two finger elements protruding from\nthe outer circumferential edge towards a central vertical axis drawn perpendicular to the planar surface of the plate form a holding opening for a reamer driver.  The internal edge profile of the backing plate forms an observation opening to allow visual\ninspection of bone fragments.  This attachment feature only uses a single point attachment of the reamer to the shaft at the edge profile of the backing plate.  It is therefore subject to displacement of the shaft laterally, causing the centerlines of\nthe shaft and reamer to be not precisely aligned.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,409,732 to Salyer discloses a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is secured at one of the shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool\ncollate is secured to the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be positioned.  The boss is equipped with a securing device of the bayonet type having a latch\nmechanism, which holds the rotary tool on the boss coaxially of the driver during use.  The securing device has a tapered bore extending from the distal end of the boss axially of the shaft.  The rotary tool has a diametrical bar extending across a\nbottom tool driver opening with a centrally located circular disk therein.  The disk of the rotary tool fits within the bore of the tool shaft boss so as to concentrically locate the rotary tool and the tool shaft on the same axis.  The latch mechanism\nholds the tool driver and the tool together in this position, whereby rotary tools of a multitude of sizes can be secured concentrically to the tool shaft without holding a plurality of critical tolerances when machining the bayonet type securing device\nor the rotary tool bottom bar.  The tool driver is a shaft with a slot on the end that receives the acetabular reamer.  It deals with the details of the device for attaching the acetabular reamer to the shaft.  This type of slotted attachment does not\nresult in coaxial mounting of the reamer that is coincident with the centerline of the shaft, even though the different components of the shaft are said to be coaxially aligned.  The reamer is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,730,094 to Salyer et al. discloses cutting edges for reamers and a method for making same.  Each reamer has a plurality of cutters spirally arranged on reamer surface.  Each cutter has a continuous cutting edge.  Edges may be\ngenerally straight in planes perpendicular to the reamer surface or tangential or parallel to the tangential plane with respect to the reamer surface.  Cutting edges may also be curved in planes perpendicular to the reamer surface or parallel or\ntangential to the reamer surface.  Further, the curvature may be convex, or concave or of other complex shapes.  There need be no relationship between the shape of cutting edges and the shape of reamer surface.  In fact, one may be curved and the other\nstraight, or both may be curved in the same or opposite directions.  These relate to the edge geometry of the cutting edges of the reamer.  As explicitly stated in the summary, "It is also an advantage of the invention to provide a new and improved\nreamer that can be stripped in the field and sterilized for re-use, and which does not have crevices and other structures to hold bone chips and tissue which cannot be easily dislodged prior to sterilization", the reamer is intended to be reused after\nsterilization and is not a disposable spherical reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,875,217 to Wolford discloses an orthopedic reamer assembly.  This orthopedic reamer assembly includes a reamer with a generally hemispherical shell having a concave side and at least one attachment feature associated with the\nconcave side.  A driver is attachable to the reamer and has a shaft with a reamer end.  A releasable collar is disposed on the reamer end, which includes a boss having at least one retaining pin.  A sleeve is fitted over the boss and includes a groove\nthat is proximate to a corresponding retaining pin.  The reamer has a cavity in the reamer end with a biasing element.  The biasing element biases the sleeve in a closed position respective to the boss.  A release pin, which press fits into the sleeve is\nprovided in the reamer end, and is conveyed through the cavity, with the biasing element biasing against the release pin.  The orthopedic reamer assembly is a complicated attachment of design of the drive shaft to an acetabular reamer with multiple\nsliding parts.  Since each of the sliding parts requires a sliding fit, there are inherent displacement possibilities and therefore, the centerline of the shaft is not reliably aligned with the centerline of the acetabular reamer.  Moreover, the\nacetabular reamer is not indicated to be a disposable spherical hollow reamer and requires complicated machined elements to enable a sliding fit.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,951,563 to Wolford discloses orthopaedic reamer with flat cutting teeth.  An orthopaedic reamer for cutting bone includes a shaft and a head coupled with the shaft.  The head includes a distal face with a plurality of punched\ncutting teeth.  Each cutting tooth includes a hole extending through the head.  At least a portion of each hole has a substantially round perimeter.  A raised lip is positioned adjacent to and extends around at least part of the substantially round\nportion.  A reamer-to-shaft attachment that has concentricity is not disclosed.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,978,648 to Wolford discloses an acetabular reamer lipping system and method.  This is a lipping tool for lipping an acetabular reamer.  The lipping tool has a bending form with a curved surface and a bending form axis of\nrotation.  A pressure tool has a pressure tool curved surface adjacent to and complimentary with the bending form curved surface.  The pressure tool has a pressure tool axis.  The pressure tool is rotatable about the pressure tool axis and is also\nrotatable about the bending form axis.  This lipping tool merely bends a spherical hollow reamer into shape and does not disclose how this lipped reamer is attached concentric to a shaft that rotates the reamer.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0181916 to Wolford discloses an orthopedic reamer with flat cutting teeth.  This orthopedic reamer is for cutting bone and includes a shaft and a head coupled with the shaft.  The head includes a\ndistal face with a plurality of cutting teeth.  Each cutting tooth includes a hole extending through the head.  At least a portion of each hole has a substantially round perimeter.  A raised lip is positioned adjacent to and extends around at least part\nof the substantially round portion.  The \'916 publication discloses an orthopedic reamer with flat cutting teeth having a shaft attached to acetabular reamer cups.  The reamer cups of the \'916 publication are not disposable in nature.  The orthopedic\nreamer with flat cutting teeth publication does not provide a spherical hollow reamer assembly including a space for capturing bone fragments or bone cement debris.  The attachment of the acetabular reamer to the drive shaft includes a complicated\nmechanism and does not reliably align the centerline of the drive shaft with that of the acetabular reamer.  As such, wobble free rotation is not provided.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0095041 to Fehlbaum et al. discloses a contoured reamer teeth and method for their manufacture.  An acetabular reamer has a cutting shell having a series of doubly curved cutting teeth of a quantity\nto substantially reduce a cutting pressure on each tooth as well as to reduce a size of a typical chip generated upon cutting.  Substantially all the teeth each have a matched arc cutting edge of substantial length that has a cutting profile which\nsubstantially matches a profile of a shape to be cut.  The apertures in which the cutting edges are formed from a sheet material and have at least one flat edge formed by a punch.  Such a configuration reduces the number of teeth required to cut the\nshape.  The contoured reamer teeth publication does not provide a procedure for assembling a reamer.  In addition, the contoured reamer teeth are not disposable in nature, and therefore over time will become dulled, thereby causing enhanced friction\nduring reaming and potentially damaging the bone.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0235539 to Blunn et al. discloses a surgical kit for hemiarthroplasty hip replacement.  This kit comprises a femoral head and a reamer.  The kit is suited for performing a hip hemiarthroplasty, in\nwhich a femoral head is fitted directly into a socket reamed into the acetabular without any permanent liner or prosthetic acetabular being implanted.  The reamer is used to ream out the acetabulum until cancellous bone is exposed so that it bleeds\nliquid containing stem cells.  The spherical shape of reamer provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the bone joints.  The surgical kit disclosed by the \'539 publication is provided for multiple use, and therefore the tool will become\nless efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  Significantly, the \'539 publication does not teach a disposable spherical hollow surgical reamer tool that is attached to a drive shaft with coincident\ncenterlines.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0243124 to Fehlbaum, et al. discloses contoured Reamer Teeth and Method of Manufacture.  An acetabular reamer is designed for cutting a required cut shape.  The reamer has a cutting shell having a\nseries of doubly curved cutting teeth of a quantity to substantially reduce a cutting pressure on each tooth as well as to reduce a size of a typical chip generated upon cutting.  Substantially all the teeth each have a matched arc cutting edge of\nsubstantial length that has a cutting profile which substantially matches a profile of a shape to be cut.  The apertures in which the cutting edges are formed have at least one straight edge by which a punch may be used in the process of forming the\noriented edge.  This disclosure deals with preparing cutting edges by first forming apertures with one flat edge using a laser in a spherically formed sheet and using a punch against the flat edge to create a cutting edge.  There is no disclosure in the\napplication regarding the concentric attachment of a reamer with a shaft.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0088757 to Tulkis discloses an acetabular reamer.  The reamer assembly includes a tool driver and a tool.  Tool driver comprises a shaft.  The tool receiving end of the shaft has a flange.  Formed in\nthe flange are four L-shaped bayonet catches, which receive the tool.  The tool has a body having slots.  A cutter can slidably fit into the slots.  When installed in the slots, the cutters project slightly above the body.  The projecting portions of the\ncutters form the cutting edges for shaving or cutting tissue.  The reamer is formed by attaching a tool to the tool driver by lowering it in the L-shaped bayonet catches.  The reamer can be coupled to a drive means such as a hand drill and inserted in a\nbody cavity.  Operating the reamer against body tissue shaves of body tissue.  This type of four L-shaped bayonet catches attaching a shaft to a reamer does not provide precise alignment of the centerline of the reamer and shaft since it is a single\nlocation attachment.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0163921 to Lechot et al. discloses disposable acetabular reamer from flat stock.  This disposable reamer has a reamer assembly that includes a rigid, circular molded biocompatible plastic base with\nan interface for mating with a holder and a press-formed, thin walled, perforated and toothed cutting body having interlocking interfaces for locking with the base.  The base has an aperture 19 for attachment to a shaft.  This form of attachment is a\nsingle point attachment to a deformable plastic body and will not maintain a precise alignment of the centerline of the shaft and that of the reamer especially after use when the polymer base aperture deforms.\n Foreign Publication No. WO 9007908 to Schelhas discloses an acetabulum reamer.  Acetabulum reamer for reaming the acetabulum of the human pelvic bone prior to insertion of an artificial hip joint cup comprises a reamer head on a shaft and a\nspiral reaming ridge arranged about the axis of the shaft and provided with reaming devices.  The outer edge of the reaming ridge is delimited by a section of a spherical surface whose axis of rotation is flush with the axis of the shaft.  The acetabulum\nreamer utilizes a spherical head for reaming a socket in an acetabulum.  The spherical shape of reamer provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the bone joints.  The reamer is provided for multiple use, and therefore the tool will become\nless efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  Significantly, the acetabulum reamer publication does not teach a disposable spherical hollow surgical reamer tool that is attached to a drive shaft with\ncoincident centerlines.\n There remains a need in the art for a modular easy-to-assemble spherical hollow reamer for medical applications having a disposable spherical hollow cutter.  Also needed in the art is a disposable spherical hollow cutter assembly of the type\ndescribed, which can be attached concentric to a reusable shaft portion that provides means for reaming of an acetabular bone cavity in bones without any wobbly movement.  Further needed in the art is a cutter assembly having means for collecting bone\ndebris and keeping the collected debris displaced from the cutting portion, so that heat generated at the bone cutting surface is minimized.  Still further needed in the art is a spherical hollow reamer assembly wherein, after one use of the spherical\nhollow reamer, a new spherical hollow cutter with sharp fresh cutting edges can be utilized and the old hollow cutter can be discarded.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a modular easy-to-assemble low cost spherical hollow reamer for medical applications having a disposable spherical reamer fabricated from a sheet material that is concentrically attached to a reusable shaft\nportion.  The attachment between the disposable spherical hollow reamer and the reusable shaft is accomplished by a precision threaded screw attachment at one end and a support feature at a distance away from the first threaded attachment location.  The\ndisposable spherical hollow reamer has in its interior a first welded plate that has a central threaded aperture with precision machined screw threads, and which connects directly into a threaded portion provided at the distal end of the reusable shaft. \nThis forms the first precise attachment location between the reusable shaft and the spherical hollow reamer.  These threads typically have fine threads with 8 to 12 threads per inch, preferably ACME threads similar to that present in a precision\nmicrometer.  Since these threads are formed during the machining of both the shaft and machining of the plate welded to the spherical hollow reamer, their centerlines are precisely aligned when the spherical hollow reamer is threaded into the distal end\nof the reusable shaft.  The second attachment point is a second welded plate with a central aperture that is displaced at a distance from the first welded plate.  The central aperture is concentric with the axis of the spherical hollow reamer and is\nmachined with a tolerance fit that allows this second welded plate of the spherical hollow reamer to slide over the precisely machined outer diameter surface of the shaft, providing a second support location.  Several sizes of reamers have identical\nsecond plate aperture and first plate threads, and they can be interchangeably attached to several spherical hollow reamers providing interchangeability.\n Briefly stated, the spherical hollow reamer has a second plate welded at the distal circumference end of the spherical hollow reamer away from the first threaded welded plate.  The second welded plate has a central aperture that closely fits the\nshaft outer diameter during assembly.  The fit class is a close sliding and therefore this spherical hollow reamer is attached to the shaft first at the threaded location and secondly by the sliding fit between the shaft outer surface and the aperture of\nthe second welded plate, which is displaced from the first attachment point.  These two attachment points create a unique mechanical arrangement wherein the centerline of the shaft and the centerline of the spherical hollow reamer and this centerline\nmatch are perfectly matched even when high cutting loads are applied.  Thus, when the proximal end of the reusable shaft is inserted into a drilling machine and the shaft is rotated, the disposable spherical hollow reamer rotates without any wobbliness\nand reams or cuts a precise bone cavity replicating the shape of the spherical hollow reamer.\n Cutting teeth and bone fragment discharging apertures are provided on the outer surface of the spherical hollow cutter.  The spherical hollow reamer has an end plate with a central aperture welded integral with the outer edges of the spherical\nhollow reamer.  When the shaft is screwed into the threads of the spherical hollow reamer the outer surface of the shaft slides in the welded end plate aperture thereby creating an enclosed space within the spherical hollow reamer for accumulation of\nbone debris or bone cement debris.  The quick removal of bone fragments or bone cement debris reduces the amount of heat generated during the cutting/reaming procedure.  Graduations are provided in the reusable shaft portion to determine the depth of\ninsertion of the spherical hollow reamer into the bone cavity.\n Generally stated, the Hollow Spherical Reamer for Medical Applications broadly comprises: (i) a reusable shaft portion having a threaded distal end, a proximal end for coupling with a drilling machine and a central region for a plate; (ii) a\ndisposable spherical reamer portion with a plurality of cutting teeth and apertures for discharging bone and bone cement fragments; (iii) said disposable hollow reamer having a precisely machined screw element on a welded first plate at an interior\nlocation of the spherical hollow reamer for the screwed attachment of the hollow spherical reamer to the reusable shaft distal end; (iv) said spherical hollow reamer has a second welded end plate at or near the circumferential end of the spherical hollow\nreamer and having a precisely machined central aperture that can slide over the outer surface of the shaft during assembly; (v) said second welded plate creating a bone debris and bone cement debris collection space within the spherical hollow reamer;\nand (vi) said proximal region of the reusable shaft having a coupling portion for attachment to a drilling device.  The modular spherical hollow reamer of the present invention solves the problems associated with the prior art reamers.  In accordance\nwith the present invention, the modular spherical hollow reamer for medical applications has an easy-to-assemble disposable low cost hollow spherical reamer, which can be attached to a reusable shaft that allows for a fresh reamer to be used with each\nnew application of the reamer.  The modular spherical hollow reamer of the present invention transfers shaft torque reliably through the screwed connection while at the same time maintains the centerline of the spherical reamer preventing wobbliness\nthereof during cutting.  Bone and bone cement fragments are collected and stored away from the bone cutting area thereby reducing the possibility of bone fragment incorporation into living bone tissue.  The modular spherical hollow reamer gradually\ncreates the acetabular bone cavity or resizes an existing acetabular bone cavity, thereby reducing heat during its surgical usage.  Owing to the presence of these features, the modular spherical hollow reamer of this invention is safer to use and\noperates more efficiently than prior art reamers.\n The process for manufacturing the low cost spherical hollow reamer that is disposable involves the following steps: 1.  The hollow cutter is made from flat sheet stock of 17-4 stainless steel or 420 stainless steel with a sheet thickness of\n0.005 inch to 0.039 inch that is individually stamped to a geometrical shape as a hemi-spherical body or stamped into a plurality of petals or shapes that can be bent and joined together to a hemi-spherical shape by laser welding that adds no additional\nmaterial; 2.  The plurality of cutting teeth and optionally plurality of apertures for removing the bone fragments from the cutting interface of the low cost spherical hollow reamer preferably may be punched prior to bending and welding or after bending\nand welding.\n The Spherical Hollow Reamer Assembly is adapted to be utilized when preparing bone cavities that receive acetabular cups in a close fitting configuration with precise cavity geometry.  The cavities may be prepared from a previously prepared bone\ncavity in which the acetabular cup has come loose and has to be replaced.  In this case, the bone cavity is enlarged and the bone cement previously used has to be completely reamed out and removed.  The Spherical Hollow Reamer Assembly may also be used\nto create a bone cavity on a bone section that has no previously installed acetabular cup.  The spherical hollow reamer is disposable, so that the cutting performance of the device is not compromised through repeated use.  Several of the clinical\nproblems encountered with conventional reamers are overcome through utilization of the Spherical Hollow Reamers Assembly.  Novel design features of the Spherical Hollow Reamer Assembly and improvements to conventional reamers are multifaceted, and\ninclude a reusable shaft with a precision threaded distal end adapted to receive a disposable, single-use spherical hollow reamer portion with a corresponding precision threaded central screw providing a center line aligned wobble free attachment of the\nreamer.  The threading on the distal end of the shaft and the mating screw element have a clockwise thread that self-tightens upon use.  The spherical hollow reamer portion is discarded after a single use to ensure a sharp cutter for use in surgery. \nMoreover, when dealing with revision acetabular cup surgery, spherical hollow reamers have also been designed to cut bone cement [Polymethylmethacrylate (Acrylic) or PMMA] in a more efficient manner by providing internal space to capture the debris. \nThis reduces both the cutting temperature and time required to remove the remnant cement mantle.  Each of these features operates to decrease heat to the bone and reduce operating room time required for acetabular cup revision surgery.

This preparation can be intended for either cementing an acetabular cup (preparation\nwould be oversized to the implant) or press fitting an acetabular cup (preparation undersized to the implant).  In either case, a spherically shaped cutter is used to machine the internal geometry of the acetabulum.  These spherical cutting tools are\nrequired to cut both cortical bone (hard bone) and cancellous bone (spongy bone) during normal surgery.  The spherical cutter is generally assembled to a drive shaft which is coupled to a power drill and this assembly is used to machine the acetabulum\nfor the implant.  These cutters are intended for multiple surgeries and are used many times for many patients.  The cutting action of these reamers is afforded by a plurality of cutting teeth.  Because these teeth encounter hard bone and they are used\nmultiple times, the cutters can become dull and inefficient in their cutting ability.  Two primary problems exist with this type of instrument and surgical method:\n 1.  Since these spherical cutters are reused, special attention is needed in properly cleaning them prior to use in preparing the next patient\'s acetabulum.\n 2.  The cutting teeth can become dull even after one use and therefore do not cut bone efficiently.  In addition, this cutting inefficiency generates friction/heat which can damage or kill the surrounding bone.\n As these cutters become dull, they also do not cut an accurate preparation for the implant either in size or spherical geometry.  Even initially, these cutters can be not accurately concentric which is further compounded by the wear and use of\nthe cutter.  Although these cutters are intended for multiple uses, there are really not quality control measures which monitor their function and eventual need to be replaced.  There are not programs/qualified personnel in the hospitals that can inspect\nand evaluate the function and dimensional accuracy of the cutters after they have been used.  It would be beneficial for the patient and the hospital to be assured that the surgeon could always be supplied with a clean/sterile spherical cutter with\naccurate and sharp cutting teeth for every clinical case.\n Reaming of bone cavity is required during many orthopedic surgical procedures.  These procedures include hip replacement and shoulder replacement and the like.  Reaming of the bone cavities for the placement of an acetabular cup requires milling\nof precisely shaped bone cavity.  When the acetabular cup is fixed by interference, this precision is more critical than when the acetabular cup is bonded to the bone cavity by a cement composition.  The standard procedure for preparing a bone cavity for\nacetabular cup insertion using a conventional spherical reamer is illustrated in FIG. 1 at 10.  The bone cavity 11 is milled by a solid reamer 12, which is generally used many times until the teeth of the spherical reamer becomes dull.  Due to the\npresence of debris in the cutting area, the bone surface is subject to over heating and bone tissue degradation.  Bone cement fragments may become included into living bone tissue creating bone healing problems.\n The invention herein provides spherical hollow reamers appointed for use in medical applications.  The spherical hollow reamers are disposable, so that the cutting performance is not compromised through repeated use.  Several improvements\ntowards the clinical problems seen with conventional reamers are overcome through utilization of the hollow reamers herein.  Novel design features of the hollow reamer herein and improvements to conventional reamers are multifaceted and include a\nreusable shaft with a supporting threaded structure to precisely align a disposable, single-use spherical hollow reamer portion.  The spherical hollow reamer portion is discarded after a single use to ensure a clean debris free sharp cutter for use in\nsurgery.  Moreover, when dealing with revision hip surgery, the hollow reamers have also been designed to cut bone cement (PMMA) in a more efficient manner by providing an internal space to capture the bone cement debris and thereby reducing both the\ncutting temperature and time required to remove the remnant cement mantle.  Both these features are important in reducing heat to the bone and reducing operating room time required for revision surgery.\n While FIG. 1 illustrates conventional reamers currently utilized, FIG. 2 illustrates at 20 a cross sectional view of an assembled disposable Spherical Hollow Reamer assembly of the present invention.  The spherical hollow reamer assembly\ncomprises at 21 a reusable shaft portion with a threaded distal end at 22.  A spherical hollow reamer dome 23 with integral cutters 24 and optionally apertures (not shown) that has an interior first plate 25 welded at `W` that has threaded aperture 26\nmatching the threads of the shaft 22.  These threads are fine threads typically in the range of 8 to 12 thread per inch and are precision machined.  A second plate 27 is welded at `W` to the proximal circumferential end of the spherical hollow reamer\ndome 23 and has a central aperture 28, which is machined at a diameter suited for sliding fit on the outer diameter of the reusable shaft 21 as shown.  The threaded connection between reusable shaft threads 22 and the welded first plate central threaded\naperture 26 creates a first concentric attachment between the disposable spherical hollow reamer and the reusable shaft.  The sliding fit between the second plate aperture 27 and the reusable shaft 21 creates a second concentric support location that is\ndisplaced from the first concentric attachment creating a solid reliable attachment of the disposable spherical hollow reamer to the reusable shaft providing concentricity and wobble free attachment even when high cutting lateral loads are applied.\n FIG. 3 illustrates at 30 a cross sectional view of the disassembled disposable Spherical Hollow Reamer assembly showing the reusable shaft 31 and the disposable hollow reamer 32.  The individual parts of the reusable shaft 31 and the disposable\nhollow reamer 32 are numbered identical to that shown in FIG. 2.\n FIG. 4 illustrates at 40 a perspective view of the disposable modular hollow spherical hollow reamer showing the welded back plate with a central aperture.  The disposable spherical hollow reamer 32 is available in the size range from 36 mm to\n80 mm in 1 mm size increments.  The disposable spherical hollow reamers have a thickness generally in the range of 0.125 mm to 0.812 mm (0.005\'\' to 0.032\'\').  The disposable spherical hollow reamer 32 has a sized aperture 28 which is sized to slide over\nthe outer diameter of the reusable shaft.  Groups of sizes of reamers may use a common sized aperture 28 and corresponding threaded connection 26 in the first welded plate 25 (not visible in this perspective view) mating with a single reusable shaft\nproviding quick and easy interchange of disposable spherical hollow reamers during bone surgery.\n FIG. 5 illustrates at 50 the steps involved in the manufacture of the spherical hollow reamer 32 of FIG. 4.  The spherical hollow reamer dome 23 with plurality of cutters 24 is first welded to the first plate 25 with a threaded aperture 26 using\nlaser beam welding W. The precise thread machining may be done first on the first plate 25 prior to welding or the welding operation may be done first followed by the precision machining of the threads at 26.  Next the second plate 27 is laser beam\nwelded at W. Here again, the machining of precisely dimensioned aperture 28 may be done first on the second plate 27 prior to welding or done after welding.  Thus, the disposable spherical hollow reamer 32 is manufactured with precision centerline\nalignment with a reusable shaft.\n FIG. 6 illustrates at 60 three alternate embodiments at Method A, Method B and Method C of the method of manufacture of spherical hollow dome of the spherical hollow reamer of FIG. 5 from a flat metallic sheet.  In the first embodiment of Method\nA, the sheet metal is pressed between two dies and the pressing action produces a spherical hollow reamer dome.  The pressed hollow reamer dome is then cut with punches to produce the cutting teeth of the reamer.  In the second embodiment of Method B,\nthe flat sheet is punched into a plurality of petal shapes.  Along with the cutting teeth, these petal shapes when further formed and brought together generate a nearly spherical shape.  The contacting line between the petals is laser beam welded\ncreating a nearly spherical shaped reamer dome.  If necessary, the spherical shape of the dome may be optimized by a die pressing operation similar to Method A. In the third embodiment of Method C, the flat sheet is punched into a cut out shape which is\nsimilar to a basketball and at the same time each section is punched with cutting teeth.  These cutout shapes are then further formed and when brought together generate a nearly spherical shape similar to a basketball.  The contacting line between the\ncut out shapes is laser beam welded, creating a nearly spherical shaped reamer dome.  If necessary, the spherical shape of the dome may be optimized by a die pressing operation similar to Method A. The family of disposable reamers addresses a wide range\nof bone cavity sizes, adapted to fit with corresponding reusable shafts.\n FIG. 7 schematically illustrates at 70 a spherical hollow dome of the spherical hollow reamer manufactured by laser welding a cut and formed flat metallic sheet manufactured according to method B of FIG. 6.  The weld line between the petals is\nclearly visible.  Crease 71 extends from the outer edge of the spherical hollow dome which recesses inside the cutting portion of the spherical hollow reamer, thus maintaining a spherical cutting reamer body.\n In some of these embodiments, the disposable spherical hollow reamer portion is provided with plurality of cutting teeth on its outer surface and a plurality of apertures for disposing bone fragments and bone cement fragments away from the\nreamed area thereby reducing the heat generated at the cutting interface.  The spherical hollow reamer is discarded after a single use to ensure a sharp, efficient cutter for every surgery.  In each of these different embodiments, the disposable\nspherical hollow reamer is attached to the reusable shaft using a precisely machined screw thread that engages into a corresponding threaded hole in the distal end of the reusable shaft ad the proximal end second plate slides over the outer surface of\nthe reusable shaft.  Alternately, in the embodiments described, the shaft is composed of a low cost material, and is discarded after a single use.  With such an embodiment, each of the shaft and the spherical hollow reamer portions are disposable.  The\nsecond plate welded to the spherical hollow reamer creates a region within the interior of the spherical reamer that captures and retains the bone fragments or bone cement debris that is discharged through the apertures adjacent to the cutters on the\nouter surface of the spherical hollow reamer.  The spherical hollow reamer assembly provides a space for bone debris offering multiple benefits.  These benefits include reducing heat generated during cutting by removing the bone debris from the outer\nsurface of the cutter to the inside of the cutter and providing space for bone debris to be collected and later removed for bone grafting for the specific surgical procedure.  The space for bone fragment accumulation is in the area between the spherical\nhollow reamer and the central plate provided on the reusable shaft.\n The accumulated debris within the enclosed space may have bone fragments that are usable for building up bone tissue.  Tapping out these bone fragments through the central aperture of the second plate may be time consuming.  The second plate may\noptionally have two or three openings with a slidable closure plate for quick and easy removal of bone fragments and or bone cement residue.  Since the openings are distributed evenly surrounding the rotational axis, the spherical hollow reamer rotates\neven at high rotational speeds without vibrations.\n The key features of the low cost disposable spherical hollow assembly for medical applications include, in combination, the components set forth below: a) the spherical hollow reamer assembly comprising a disposable spherical hollow reamer and a\nreusable shaft; b) the reusable shaft having an elongated body with a proximal end and a distal end; c) the proximal end having a coupling portion appointed for attachment to a drilling device; d) the distal end having a male precision threaded portion\nfor attachment to said disposable spherical hollow reamer; e) the spherical hollow reamer having a spherical hollow reamer dome provided with a plurality of cutting teeth on the outer surface of the dome and a plurality of apertures for discharging bone\nor bone cement fragments into the interior of said spherical hollow dome; f) a first welded plate provided in the interior portion of said spherical hollow reamer dome having a central precision threaded aperture adapted to receive the threads of the\nprecision threaded screw at the distal end of the reusable shaft; g) a second welded plate provided at the proximal end covering the edges of the spherical hollow reamer dome having a center precision diameter aperture that slides over the outer diameter\nof the reusable shaft; whereby the screwed attachment of said disposable spherical hollow reamer to the reusable shaft distal end aligns their centerlines at a first alignment location and the sliding action of the second plate central aperture over the\nouter diameter of the reusable provides a second alignment location displaced from the first alignment location, thereby preventing wobbliness during reaming and creating precise bone cavities that replicate the spherical shape of the disposable\nspherical hollow reamer in a medical procedure while the containment volume between the interior of the spherical hollow reamer and the second plate captures bone fragment or bone cement fragment.\n The manufacturing process for the spherical hollow reamer dome of the disposable spherical hollow reamer comprises the following manufacturing steps; a) In the first method, Method A, a flat sheet of the reamer material is selected and pressed\nbetween a spherical dome die set to generate the precise spherical hollow reamer dome shape and cutting teeth are produced by punching operation; b) In the second method, Method B, a flat sheet of reamer material is stamped into a plurality of petal\nshapes with cutting teeth, which form a nearly spherical shape when the edges of the adjacent petals are brought together.  These contacting edges are welded, preferably by laser beam welding which does not additional material at the weld site.  If\nnecessary, the welded spherical hollow reamer dome may be pressed in a die set similar to Method A, creating a true spherical shape; c) In the third method, Method C, a flat sheet of reamer material is stamped into shape resembling basketball cutouts\nwith cutting teeth, which form a nearly spherical basketball like shape when the edges of the adjacent shapes are brought together.  These contacting edges are welded, preferably by laser beam welding which does not additional material at the weld site. \nIf necessary, the welded spherical hollow reamer dome may be pressed in a die set similar to Method A, creating a true spherical shape.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',

 'patent_description': u"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to surgical reamers that create bone cavities; and, more particularly, to a flexible disposable reamer shaft that may be attached to a modular disposable spherical or tapered hollow reamer, the disposable reamer\nshaft being concentrically attached to a modular hollow reamer to provide wobble-free rotation of the reamer tool.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  These procedures include hip replacement and shoulder replacement, and the like.  Reamers are used in procedures that involve creation of\nacetabular bone cavities that accept a properly sized acetabular cups.  Surgical reamers are used in orthopedic surgery to enlarge medullary canals of long bones such as the femur and humerus in preparation for insertion of fixation devices, performing\nan intramedullary osteotomy, stimulating bone growth.  The medullary canals of bones are seldom straight.  More typically, the canal will have some degree of curvature to it.  Should a straight and rigid series of reamers be employed to enlarge the\ncanal, there is considerable likelihood that the reamer, if not being capable of following the bone's curvature, will jam or will not remove the desired uniform amount of bone tissue.  In such a situation excessive tissue removal occurs in at least one\nplane as a reamer advances.  For this reason, medullary canals are almost always prepared with reamers having a flexible shaft.  Generally reamers for use with a flexible shaft utilize a central bore through both the reamer and drive shaft.  The central\nbore is intended to receive a long, small diameter guide pin, which is initially inserted into the medullary canal to act as a track for the advancing reamer.  However, the use of a flexible shaft does not always solve the problem of excessive tissue\nremoval and jamming.  When this jamming occurs with the prior art cutting head, the long guide pin has to be withdrawn from its position to assist in dislodging the reamer cutting head.  This can result in a loss of reduction at the fracture site. \nHeretofore, the shape of the reamer cutting heads has been basically a cylinder with a short angled area towards the front that would do the cutting and another short angled area at the back of the head that is intended to facilitate the removal of the\nreamer.  Therefore, the flexible reamer shaft has to connect to a tapered hollow reamer or a spherical reamer without wobble, maintaining local predictable concentricity as the surgeon adjusts the reaming process.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,554,192 to Isberner discloses a medullary space drill.  The medullary space drill includes a flexible shaft carrying at its opposite ends respectively a drill head, and an adapter piece adapted to be connected for rotation with\na driving means.  The shaft comprises a plurality of parallel flexible elements arranged to provide a central passage for receiving an elongated guide element.  The medullary space drill disclosed by the '192 patent has a flexible shaft portion made from\na plurality of circular rod or wire elements arranged in a circular fashion, forming a central hole for accommodating a guide pin.  The bundle of rods or wires at the ends is jointed by welding or brazing, preserving the circular arrangement.  When\ntorsion is carried by the bundle of rods, there is a twist between the driven end and the reamer drilling end; the magnitude of the twist is a function of reaming torque needed.  Thus, the twist may be irregular especially when the bone has hard and soft\nlocations, thus delivering an unsteady torque.  Also flexure of the flexible shaft portion requires some of the wire or rod elements of the bundle to move outward or inward and a single wire or rod may pop out of the circular arrangement if the flexure\nbend radius demanded is sharp.  Even though the patent states that the flexible shaft is easy to clean, the bone fragments will dislodge and enter the central hole.  Since the '192 patent contemplates cleaning of the flexible shaft, it is clearly not a\ndisposable flexible shaft.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,362,520 to Perry, discloses a flexible enclosed shaft.  This heavy-duty flexible shaft accommodates for misalignments between an input and output shaft.  The flexible shaft is comprised of a multiplicity of hollow, individually\nfabricated, interfitting members housed in a tubular, bendable shaft.  Each segment is intimately engaged, one within the other, yet the segments are so designed to allow for limited longitudinal movement while restricting circumferential movement\nbetween segments during torsion transmissions from the input to the output shafts.  The flexible enclosed shaft disclosed by the '520 patent is a shaft designed for industrial use, but is not for medical use since it requires lubrication.  The torque is\ndelivered from the input shaft to the output shaft through the interfitting members.  The cylindrical pipe merely serves to contain the interfitting members and does not carry any toque.  The shaft does not accommodate a guide pin.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,541,423 to Barber discloses drilling a curved hole in bone tissue.  This drilling apparatus is for attachment to a rotary motor that includes a flexible shaft confined in an elongated tubular sheath.  The sheath is formed from\na semi-rigid material which is bendable to a desired curvature, at the use site to select the curvature of the drilled hole, and which is rigid enough to retain that curvature in use.  A drilling bit is fixed to one end of the flexible shaft, and\nincludes a shank coacting with the distal end of the sheath to rotationally guide the drilling bit.  The flexible shaft projects from the sheath at the proximal end so that both components may be secured to a drilling motor which is manipulated to guide\nthe sheath while rotating the cutting bit.  The sheath may remain in the drilled hole temporarily as a liner to guide the passage there through of a relatively stiff wire or other filamentary member.  The sheath does not rotate and deliver the torque. \nRather the spring-like flexible shaft resides inside the sheath and delivers the torque to the drill bit.  The flexible shaft within the sheath is not indicated to accommodate a guide pin.  Thus the drill bit and the reaming location is only controlled\nby the tip of the sheath, which is distal from the reaming location in the bone canal.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,706,659 to Matthews, et al. discloses a flexible connecting shaft for an intramedullary reamer.  The flexible connecting shaft for an intramedullary reamer has several short segments or links are attached together to form an\nelongated flexible shaft.  The shaft is designed to bend along its longitudinal axis while transmitting torque without any lag in such transmission, due to the specific attachment means for the links.  A link at one end of the flexible shaft as made by a\nplurality of the links includes means provided for attachment to a torque providing device such as an electric motor.  At the opposite end of the shaft, the last link includes structure thereon enabling connection to a drill bit.  The plurality of short\nsegments or links made of a material such as stainless steel, chrome cobalt-molybdenum alloy, titanium, or other metals.  Each segment or link includes a male end and female end with each male end being specifically configured so as to interengage with\nthe female end of an adjacent link.  The links may be connected together to form a reamer shaft by inserting through the aligned holes in the individual links a flexible rod.  This rod will hold the links together while allowing the flexing of the shaft\nabout the longitudinal axis.  The reamer shaft which will flex, curve or bend while transmitting torque and while at the same time reaming naturally curved long bones without cutting through the cortex or side wall of the bones.  The links are only\nflexible at the joint locations and the inserted flexible shaft suffers piece wise bending, especially when the segment lengths are large.  The flexing of the shaft requires free space between the links and as a result the torque transmission is not\nsmooth in spite that the patent states that it is free lag in torque transmission.  The flexible rod inserted does not function as a guide pin that guides the reamed bone cavity.  The drill or reamer is not indicated to accommodate a guide pin and\ntherefore the drilling or reaming location within a bone cavity can wander when the flexible shaft is flexed by the surgeon.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,751,922 and EP 0253526 to DiPietropolo disclose a flexible medullary reamer.  The flexible medullary reamer is designed for shaping the medullary space of bones.  The shaft is comprised of a single solid element.  The flexible\nmedullary rotational reamer for clearing, enlarging or otherwise modifying the medullary space of bones has a flexible shaft with a cutting head at one end and an adaptor piece at its opposite end for connecting said shaft to a rotational drive element,\nthereby causing rotation of the shaft.  The shaft has a small diameter axial bore throughout its length to receive an elongated guide element.  The flexible reamer shaft is a carbon fiber reinforced composite adapted for transmitting the torque from the\ndrive mechanism to the drilling element while being still flexible.  The torque transmission element has the high modulus carbon fibers embedded in low modulus polymer.  Creating the composite and modulus mismatch does not provide smooth flexibility or\ntorque transmission of the flexible shaft since the carbon fiber may delaminate from the surrounding polymer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,122,134 to Borzone, et al. discloses a surgical reamer.  The surgical reamer of the '134 patent uses a small flexible shaft to guide a reamer in an inclined orientation to enlarge a bone cavity.  The reamer is guided by a guide\npin.  The flexible shaft in the drawing appears to be a shaft with spiral cuts.  This type of shaft is expensive to make and hence is not commonly discarded after each operation and is subject to cross contamination since the flexible shaft with a\ncentral hole for a guide pin is not easy to clean.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,488,761 to Leone discloses a flexible shaft and method for manufacturing same.  A shaft coupling for transmitting power includes a flexible hollow rod that extends in a longitudinal direction and has pairs of helical slots\nformed thereon.  The flexible shaft can be rotated in both directions without jamming of the cutters.  The flexible shaft of the '761 patent uses a machined helical pair or grooves to improve flexibility of the shaft.  Such construction is hard and\nexpensive to machine, and requires specialized machining techniques.  The slots machined are required to be wide for effective cleaning.  Due to this expensive machining process involved, the flexible shaft needs to be cleaned and reused and is not\ndisposable.  The attachment procedure for the electrical motor or the reamer head is not disclosed.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,908,423 to Kashuba, et al. discloses a flexible medullary reaming system.  This apparatus for reaming a bone canal, such as the medullary canal of a femur, has a flexible shaft with a proximal end for engaging a rotary\ntransmission source.  The proximal end of a first reamer is coupled to the distal end of the flexible shaft to prepare the distal portion of the canal.  The flexible medullary reaming system disclosed by the '423 patent comprises a flexible shaft to\nwhich a group of three reamers, first, second and third are attached.  The first reamer reams the proximal portion of the bone canal; the second reamer reams the intermediate portion, while the third reamer reams the distal portion of the bone canal. \nThe third reamer may be driven independent of the first two reamers.  The flexible shaft is flexed from a straight configuration to position the third reamer to ream in an arc in a proximal portion of a bone.  The apparatus further comprises a\nmetaphyseal template having the shape of the prosthesis for guiding the reaming apparatus in forming the calcar region of the canal.  The curvature of the medullary canal, as formed, rather than the angles formed according to the prior art, allows the\nimplant shape to more closely match the curvature of the anatomy.  This flexible shaft is of any design including a spirally wound shaft and is not indicated to be disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,053,922 to Krause, et al. discloses a flexible shaft.  This improved flexible shaft is used in the reaming of the medullary space in bones.  The shaft is comprised of a solid element with a longitudinal bore the entire length\nand an appropriately formed slot which extends spirally around the shaft either continuously or segmentally.  Attached to the shaft's opposite ends respectively, are a cutting head and a means of connecting the shaft to a driving mechanism.  The flexible\nshaft of the '922 patent uses a spiral grooved solid shaft that can flex due to the interlocking segments that flex and transmit torque.  The shaft has a central bore suited for a guide wire.  Bone debris can easily get into the interlocking locations\ncreating jamming of the flexible shaft.  The process of making spiral grooves is expensive and the flexible shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n Foreign Patent Application Patent No. WO/2003/039378 to White discloses a drive shaft coupling and flexible surgical reamer.  The reamer employs a fitting with a radially flexible member, e.g., a split collet or a super-elastic collar that\nreceives an elongated tubular shaft of super-elastic alloy.  A compression sleeve is applied to the collet, in one embodiment, while the collar is located within a counter-bore of the fitting in another embodiment.  Relative motion between the shaft,\nfitting and collet (or collar) induces a super-elastic activation in the shaft to form the desired coupling.  The drive shaft coupling and flexible surgical reamer of the '378 patent uses a super-elastic shaft made from nickel titanium alloy, Nitinol,\nwhich is a shape memory alloy.  This Nitinol flexible shaft is expensive.  It requires specialized heat treatment to provide shape memory properties, and thus is not disposable.\n Non-Patent Document Flexible Reamers and Reaming Heads at www.chrispqld.com/easi_sterilise/flex_reamer.pdf discloses photographs of a flexible reamer.  The shaft has a continuous helical groove, which enables flexible bending and torque\ntransmission.  The ends of the shaft are attached to a driving mechanism at one end and a cannulated reamer at the other end.  The flexible shaft of the Flexible Reamers and Reaming Heads document uses a helical cut grooved solid shaft that can flex only\nat small flexure radius.  Repeated flexing is indicated to result in loss of the reamer shaft shape.  Bone fragments can get in between the helical cut portions, making the reamer very difficult to clean.  The helical grooving is expensive; and therefore\ncleaning is anticipated.  The flexible reamer shaft is therefore not disposable.\n Non-Patent Document NT Flexible Reamer Shaft for Orthopaedic Application at http://www.fitec.co.jp/ftm/english/nt-e/reamer.htm discloses a flexible reamer shaft made from a shape memory alloy.  When the shaft tube is bent, it returns back to its\noriginal shape.  The ends of the shaft are attached to a driving mechanism at one end and a cannulated reamer at the other end.  The flexible shaft of the NT Flexible Reamer Shaft document uses shaft metal alloy tube which can be flexed but returns to\nits original shape.  The flexible shaft carries torque from the drive to the drill.  This NT flexible shaft is expensive.  It requires specialized heat treatment to provide shape memory properties, and thus is not disposable.\n There remains a need in the art for a low-cost, disposable shaft that is capable of transmitting torque from the driving mechanism to a bone reamer.  The disposable shaft must be flexible and enable reaming or cleaning of curved segments of a\nbone cavity without damaging bone tissue.  The disposable nature of the low-cost flexible reamer will prevent cross contamination of bone debris, blood and tissue residues from patient to patient since cleaning of non-disposable flexible reamer shafts is\nusually difficult and unreliable.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The disposable flexible reamer shaft broadly includes, a flexible tube formed from cylindrically braided groups of wires forming a torque transmitting flexible tube shaft.  Inside the braided wire tube structure a flexible polymeric tube is\nprovided.  The ends of the flexible braided tube are welded, brazed, crimped or glued to hardware that connects to a fitting.  One end of the fitting is compatible with attachment to an electrical motor drive.  The other end is adapted for attachment to\na fitting that connects to a modular reamer that may be tapered, cylindrical or spherical, hollow or solid.  This attachment is typically accomplished by a threaded connection having counter clockwise threads that do not loosen during the reaming\nprocedure, or the attachment can be through a hex or square type fitting.\n The present invention provides a disposable shaft for reamers.  Reamer shafts are typically long with a shaft length in the range of 250 to 400 millimeters.  These shafts have a small shaft diameter typically in the range of 4 to 14 millimeters,\npreferably 5 millimeters for modular hollow tattered reamers and 14 mm for attachment to a modular tapered, cylindrical or spherical, hollow or solid reamer.  The shaft must have certain features for the concentric attachment of the disposable shaft with\na modular reamer maintaining the local centerline of the shaft with that of the axis of rotation of the modular reamers attached.  In this manner, the surgeon can clearly control the modular reamers with wobble-free rotation of the modular reamers.  The\nmodular reamer and the reamer shaft must be cannulated.  By cannulated is meant that the reamer shaft has a central hole for inserting a guide pin.  The guide pin inserted into the bone cavity provides the aiming point, and the exact orientation of the\nreamer.  The guide pin provides one support for the reamer while the second support is provided by a long length threaded attachment of the modular reamer with the reamer shaft, as described herein below.  This two-support attachment of the modular\nreamer to the flexible shaft precise local centerline matching of the rotation axis of the modular reamer with the local centerline of the flexible shaft at the modular reamer attachment end.  The guide pin not only passes through the modular reamer but\nis supported within the annulus of the flexible reamer shaft within a flexible polymeric tube provided within the annulus of the cylindrically braided flexible reamer tubular shaft.\n The disposable flexible reamer shaft for medical applications has two ends.  A first end is adapted for attachment to a modular tapered, cylindrical or spherical, hollow or solid reamer.  The second end is adapted for attachment to a motor\ndrive.  Both of these reamers have female threads at the proximal end where they attach to the disposable flexible reamer shaft.  The threads are generally oriented in the counter clockwise direction, so that the threads do not loosen during the reaming\noperation.  These modular tapered hollow reamers, as well as spherical hollow reamers, are detailed in pending application Ser.  No. 11/704,754, filed Feb.  9, 2007, Ser.  No. 11/973,260, filed Oct.  5, 2007 and Ser.  No. 12/072,2671, filed on Feb.  27,\n2008, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference thereto.  These reamers have a central aperture to accept a guide pin.\n The attachment of the modular tapered, cylindrical or spherical, hollow or solid, reamer to the distal end threads of the disposable flexible reamer shaft is a single point attachment and relies on the threaded length provided to maintain local\nconcentricity of the shaft.  Since the shaft is flexible, the only issue that matters is the local concentricity.  The surgeon can reliably guide the shaft along any orientation as long as the reamer follows exactly the orientation selected by the\nsurgeon.  In such cases, the reamer aim point is precisely determined by the insertion point of the guide pin within the bone cavity.  This process of orienting the shaft and the reamer is aided by the previously inserted guide pin in the bone cavity, so\nthat the surgeon can readily orient the reamer within the bone cavity.  The flexible shaft may be used for creating a fresh bone cavity or for enlarging an existing bone cavity.\n When a modular hollow reamer is used with the flexible shaft, it captures the bone debris and moves it away from the cutting location, thereby reducing heat build up at the reaming surface.  This prevents damage to bone tissue and promotes rapid\nbone healing.  Since the shaft is a low-cost construction, it can be disposed off readily, thus preventing cross contamination.\n The low-cost disposable flexible reamer shaft for a disposable spherical or tapered hollow reamer for medical applications comprises: i. a flexible cylindrically braided shaft in the form of a tube that carries torque; ii.  the cylindrical\nbraided shaft having a first end element with male screw threads of length sufficient for attachment to a modular tapered, cylindrical or spherical, hollow or solid, reamer; iii.  the male element screw threads being counter clockwise, thereby preventing\nloosening of the modular reamer during the bone reaming procedure; iv.  the cylindrically braided shaft having a second end element with matching fittings to accept a motor drive shaft; v. the first and second end elements being attached to a\ncylindrically braided shaft by welding, brazing, crimping or gluing; vi.  said braided cylindrical shaft having a central aperture that carries a polymeric flexible tube element; and vii.  a guide pin affixed to the bone cavity entering said modular\nreamer and extending into the polymeric tube element with close diametrical tolerance setting the direction of reaming action, as guided by the surgeon; viii.  whereby a surgeon guides the low-cost disposable flexible shaft with the modular reamer guided\nto reach a precise aim point within bone cavity, as set by the selected guide pin location within the bone cavity along a reaming direction selected by the surgeon. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n The invention will be more fully understood and further advantages will become apparent when reference is had to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings, in which:\n FIG. 1 Illustrates an assembled view of the disposable flexible reamer shaft for medical applications according to the subject invention;\n FIG. 2 Illustrates the cylindrically braided tube shaft central portion of the disposable flexible reamer shaft;\n FIG. 3 Illustrates the details of the cylindrically braided tube shaft central portion showing braided bundle of wires and the crimping sleeve;\n FIG. 4 Illustrates the fitting at the first end fitting of the disposable flexible reamer shaft that screws into a modular reamer; and\n FIG. 5 Illustrates the fitting at the second end of the disposable flexible reamer shaft that attaches to a drive device.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n In orthopedic surgery, many surgical procedures require the need to ream the internal cavity of long bones.  These include fracture procedures and total hip procedures.  In the current technology, rigid solid reamers and flexible reamers are\nused for preparing the bone canals for implants.  These reamers can be one-piece construction and also modular allowing for the cutting head to be removed and different diameter sizes attached.  Cutters can become dull even after one use and the option\nto discard the cutter would provide a significant benefit for the surgeon and the patient.  It would assure that the cutters are always sharp and clean for each patient.\n The reamer shafts, especially flexible shafts, which are designed to drive these cutters are typically reused.  Although the sharpness of cutting teeth is not an issue, the ability to properly clean these reamer shafts is an issue.  Many of the\nreamer shafts are cannulated with a small hole running down the center of the shaft, which allows blood, bone and other biologic matter to be captured within the shaft.  It can be very difficult to remove and properly clean this type of contaminated\nshaft.  If it is not properly cleaned it can become a potential infection problem when it is used on the next patient.\n The disposable flexible reamer shaft of the present invention is directed towards meeting the following objectives: 1.  Assure that the patient always has a clean, sterile reamer shaft; 2.  Eliminate the need to clean a reamer shaft; 3. \nEliminate the potential for infection from contamination through biologic debris; and 4.  Assure the quality and function of the reamer shaft is always consistent for the patient.\n A disposable flexible reamer shaft must accomplish several design objectives in order to provide the proposed benefits to the patient.  These include:\n 1.  Ability to flex in order to accommodate the curvature of the bone canal;\n 2.  Cannulated, a hole running through the center, to accept a guide rod and thereby maintain positional control of the reamer shaft down the canal of the bone preventing the cutter from migrating out the cortical wall of the bone;\n 3.  Strong enough to flex but still capable of transmitting the required torque to the cutter;\n 4.  One end having a drive fitting to be assembled to a power tool;\n 5.  Other end having a modular fitting which provides for the attachment of multiple sized cutters and which maintains cutter concentricity to the reamer shaft;\n 6.  Assembly of the flexible reamer shaft, which provides for forward and reverse motion; and\n 7.  Cost-effective method of manufacturing that meets the functional requirements but is also disposable, thereby eliminating the potential biohazard from attempting to clean/reuse a flexible reamer shaft.\n The present invention uses a cylindrically braided tubular shaft that is flexible and carries the torque from the drive end to the reamer.  The cylindrical braiding is well known in the art and it uses four or more fine diameter wires handled as\na ribbon and braided, with an individual group of wire ribbons supporting each other.  As a result of this nested self-supporting structure, the braided cylindrical tube can transmit torque without any slack and can flex without any wires coming loose or\nextending further from the braided construction.  All that happens during flexing is the gap between wires in the ribbon separate out ever so slightly to accommodate the flexure of the cylindrically braided shaft construction.  The ends of the\ncylindrically braided tubular shaft are fitted with a male counter clockwise screw thread connection element at the first end and a motor shaft attachment element at the second end.  At the first end, the counter clockwise male screw threads attach to\nfemale threads provided in a modular tapered, cylindrical or spherical, hollow or solid reamer, that is provided with a central aperture for receiving a guide pin.  The connection of these fittings to the cylindrically braided tubular shaft can be\naccomplished by means including welding, brazing, crimping or gluing.  A polymeric flexible tube fits inside the central aperture of the cylindrical braided tubular shaft with the outer surface of the polymeric tube intimately contacting the interior\nsurface of the cylindrically braided tubular shaft.  The polymeric tube thus prevents bone debris from entering into the interior of the cylindrically braided tubular shaft.  The inside diameter of the polymeric flexible tube is a clearance fit to a\nstainless steel guide pin that passes through the reamer.  The guide pin is generally long and is initially affixed within a bone cavity setting the reaming aiming point and reaming direction.  The polymeric flexible tube glides over the guide pin that\npasses through the modular reamers attached to the disposable flexible shaft with a low coefficient friction generating minimal polymeric debris.  Thus the reaming direction is controlled by two support locations.  First the threaded length of the male\nthreads on the first end of the cylindrically braided shaft provides a long wobble-free, precise connection to the modular reamers.  Secondly, the guide pin affixed within the bone cavity sets the direction and location of the reaming procedure and is\nclearance contact with the end of the reamer and the polymeric flexible tube setting the local centerline of the flexible shaft at the reaming end.  The surgeon can adjust the reaming direction by merely flexing the flexible shaft and the reamer\norientation is immediately followed along with the orientation of the guide pin.  The reamer aim location is still determined by the inserted guide pin location even thought the orientation of the reaming direction may be changed by the surgeon by\nflexing the flexible reamer shaft.  The reamer follows the precise orientation due to the local concentricity of the reamer rotation axis with that of the first end of the flexible reamer shaft.\n FIG. 1 illustrates the flexible disposable reamer shaft assembly at 100.  The reamer shaft comprises a central braided tube shaft portion 101 which is attached to a fitting 102 at the first end that attaches to a the female screw threads of a\nmodular tapered, cylindrical or spherical, hollow or solid, reamer.  The second end of the central braided tube shaft is attached to a fitting 103 that attaches to a motor drive.  These components can be made of the same material or different materials. \nAssembly would require the ends 102 and 103 attached to the cylindrically braided tubular shaft using welding, brazing crimping or glued with for example epoxies to maintain a strength level capable of withstanding the torsional, stresses, bending\nstresses, tensile loads and compressive loads which it would be subjected to during a normal surgical procedure such as a total hip replacement surgery or repair of a fractured bone.  Inside the cylindrically braided tube shaft there is a flexible\npolymeric tube the outer diameter of which contacts the interior of the cylindrically braided tube shaft.  The joining processes such as welding or brazing generate heat and the flexible polymeric tube needs to be protected during this joining operation. This can be done by segmenting the inner polymeric tube, displacing it away from heated zone and pushing it back to the desired location.  Joining methods such as crimping or gluing do not have this heat related problem.\n In a preferred embodiment, the flexible reamer shaft is composed of an inner flexible polymeric tube inserted inside a stainless steel cylindrically braided flexible tube shaft with crimped end fittings using crimp sleeves.  This construction\nallows adequate torque transmission, flexibility and also assurance that with a shaft failure, the flexible inner tube will not fragment into several pieces while in the canal of the bone.  The design of the braided cylindrical flexible tube shaft and an\ninner plastic tube work in conjunction to provide strength and flexibility.\n FIG. 2 Illustrates at 200 cylindrically braided tube shaft central portion 101 of the disposable flexible reamer shaft.  The end 101a is used to attach to a male threaded fitting for attachment to a modular reamer.  The end 101b is used to\nattach to a fitting for attachment to a drive such as an electrical motor shaft.  These fittings are inserted into the ends of the cylindrically braided tube shaft central portion 101 and crimped using a crimping sleeve as shown in FIG. 1.\n FIG. 3 Illustrates at 300 a photograph of the braiding details of the cylindrically braided tube shaft central portion 101 of the disposable flexible reamer shaft.  The braided portion has seven wires held flat in the form of a ribbon and\ncylindrically braided as shown.  The end of the cylindrically braided tube shaft central portion 101 is held together permanently by a crimping sleeve 105.\n FIG. 4 Illustrates at 400 the fitting 102 at the first end of the cylindrically braided tube shaft 101 of FIG. 1 or 2 for the screwed attachment of the modular reamer to the disposable flexible reamer shaft.  The end shown at 102a shows a male\nscrew thread that is threaded in the counter clockwise direction.  The central tube shown at 102a has an aperture for the guide pin insertion that passes through the central aperture provided in the modular reamer.  The end shown at 102b is inserted into\nthe central opening at 101a of the cylindrically tubular braided central shaft portion and crimped using a crimp sleeve as shown in FIG. 1.\n FIG. 5 Illustrates at 500 the fitting 103 at the second end of the cylindrically braided tube shaft 101 of FIG. 1 or 2 for the attachment to a drive shaft of electrical motor drive.  The fitting 103 has the first end 103a, which is inserted into\nthe central opening at 101b of the cylindrically tubular braided central shaft portion after the insertion of the close fitting polymeric flexible tube.  A crimp sleeve is used to complete the attachment of 103 into the second end of cylindrically\nbraided tube shaft 101 as shown in FIG. 1.  The second end 103b of the fitting 103 has a protruding shaft for attachment to a chuck provided on the drive shaft of an electric motor.\n The key features of the low cost disposable flexible reamer shaft for medical applications include, in combination, the components set forth below: a) a flexible cylindrically braided shaft in the form of a tube that carries torque; b) said\ncylindrical braided shaft having a first end element with a male screw threads of sufficient length for attachment to a modular tapered, cylindrical or spherical, hollow or solid, reamer; c) said male element screw threads being counter clockwise, and\nthereby preventing loosening of the modular reamer during the bone reaming procedure; d) said cylindrically braided shaft having a second end element with matching fittings sized to fit to a chuck of a power drive; e) the first and second end elements\nare attached to cylindrically braided shaft by welding, brazing, crimping or gluing; f) said braided cylindrical shaft having a central aperture that carries a polymeric flexible tube element with a central aperture; and g) a guide pin affixed to bone\ncavity, the guide pin entering a central aperture of said modular reamer and extending into the polymeric tube element with close diametrical tolerance, thereby setting the direction of reaming action as guided by the surgeon; whereby a surgeon guides\nsaid low cost disposable flexible shaft with the modular reamer guided to reach a precise aim point within bone cavity as set by the selected guide pin location within the bone cavity along a reaming direction selected by the surgeon, whereby the local\ncenterline of the low cost disposable flexible reamer shaft at the first end of the reamer attachment is concentric to the centerline of the modular reamer, providing wobble-free reaming action.\n The manufacturing process for the low cost disposable flexible reamer shaft for medical applications comprises the following manufacturing steps; 1.  cylindrically braiding a tube shaft with an outer diameter in the range of 4 to 14 millimeters\nhaving a first end and a second end; 2.  providing a machined first end fitting with a central aperture for a guide pin; a. said first end fitting having a first end having male threads in counter clockwise direction for attachment to modular reamer\nfemale threads; b. said first end fitting having a second end having attachment features for connecting to said first end of a cylindrically braided tube shaft; 3.  providing a machined second end fitting with a central aperture for a guide pin; a. said\nsecond end fitting having a first end having attachment features for connecting to said first end of a cylindrically braided tube shaft; b. said second end fitting having a second end having attachment features for connecting to a motor drive shaft; 4. \nproviding a polymeric flexible tube having an inside aperture closely fitting on a guide pin used to guide the flexible shaft and having an outer diameter closely fitting the inside aperture of the cylindrically braided tube shaft; 5.  inserting said\npolymeric flexible tube inside the inside aperture of the cylindrically braided tube shaft; 6.  inserting and permanently attaching said machined first end fitting into the first end of said cylindrically braiding a tube shaft; 7.  inserting and\npermanently attaching said machined second end fitting into the second end of said cylindrically braiding a tube shaft; whereby said low cost disposable flexible reamer shaft for medical applications with cannulation is fabricated from stainless steel,\nNitinol or flexible metallic material.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n",

 'patent_description': u"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a modular easy-to-assemble tapered hollow reamer for medical applications; and more particularly, to a hollow tapered reamer having a disposable reamer assembly, which can be attached to a reusable shaft portion\nand includes a bone debris capturing cavity.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  These procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Reamers are also used in procedures that involve the\ninternal fixation of fractures.  Prior art reamers typically fall into two major classes: rigid and flexible shaft.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer.  Solid\ncylindrical or tapered reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper fit\nof the implant.  Conventional reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient\nfriction/heat to damage or kill the surrounding bone.  These prior art solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis. \nThese dull blades also incorporate bone debris or bone cement debris into the living bone tissue, creating bone healing problems.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,116,200 to Braun et al. discloses a milling tool for surgical purposes.  The surgical milling tool is a hand-operated milling machine for milling the heads or sockets of bone joints and has a spherical shape.  The tool is\nformed of a hemispherical cup integrally formed with a cylindrical skirt and flange and is provided with a plurality of openings of semi-oval shape, each having a cutting edge arranged at the minor axis of the oval shape.  The openings are situated such\nthat, upon rotation of the cup, the cutting edges thereof overlap to provide a continuous cutting edge surface conforming generally to the shape of the cup.  The hemispherical shape of the cup provides the ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the\nbone joints.  Bone and cartilage shavings are formed during the milling process and are collected in a border area inside of the hemispherical cup.  The surgical milling tool is provided for multiple uses and therefore the tool will become less efficient\nafter each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.  Moreover, the spherically shaped reaming tool is not tapered.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,190,548 to Davis discloses surgical reamer.  This surgical bone reamer includes a rotatable, elongated shank having a proximal end, a distal end and a longitudinal axis.  A reaming head mounted on the distal end.  A plurality\nof equally spaced walls is radially disposed on the reaming head around the longitudinal axis.  Tip edges for penetrating bone are defined on the radial walls to be disposed angularly with the longitudinal axis.  Reaming edges joined to the tip edges\nextend longitudinally from the tip edges in the proximal direction parallel to and an equal radial distance from the longitudinal axis for reaming a cylindrical tunnel when the reaming head is rotated in bone.  Tapered flutes disposed angularly between\nthe tip edges and the radial walls permit bone to be evacuated through the reaming head when forming a tunnel in bone.  The reaming head is provided with angular tips and edges for penetrating the bone and is thus not a single use disposable cutter.  The\ndebris created is not stored away from the cutting edge and thus previously cut material may be included in the bone.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,549,613 to Goble et al. discloses a modular surgical drill.  This modular surgical drill is in the form of a rigid drill shaft and a drill bit, which are connected together by a tongue-and-groove arrangement attaching the rear\nend of the drill bit to the forward end of the drill shaft.  Each of the shaft and drill bit are provided with through bores extending centrally through their entire length.  These bores become aligned upon assembly of the drill bit and shaft.  The\nmodular drill is intended to be employed with a guidewire for drilling holes into bone.  The assembled drill bit and shaft are placed on the guidewire and moved down such guidewire into contact with the bone, whereupon a tunnel may be formed into the\nbone by rotating and advancing the drill bit along the guidewire.  The dimensions of the bore and guidewire are so selected as to prevent the drill bit and drill shaft from moving relative to one another once they are assembled and mounted on the\nguidewire.  Debris created during drilling is not removed and collected away from the cutting location.  The central bore is solid and as such does not receive cut bone debris.  The cutter used is not disposable.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,556,399 to Huebner discloses a bone-harvesting drill apparatus and method for its use.  A coring drill harvests bone from a donor area of the human body.  The drill bit is formed with a cylindrical, hollow shaft and a\nhalf-conical tip or cutting head.  The cutting head is provided with a sharpened edge, which meets at an apex with a non-sharpened edge, forming an obtuse angle of approximately 120 degrees.  The sharpened edge is configured to cut into bone when the\ndrill bit is rotated in a clockwise direction.  With the apex directed against a section of bone, the cutting edge sheers off fragments of bone, which are then drawn upwardly through the hollow shank of the drill bit.  As the drill bit is forced\ndownwardly, continuous cutting action occurs and the morselized bone can then be removed from the shank and used to build-up bone in other areas to which it is transplanted.  The drill bit fittingly mates on the distal end a fitting that renders the\ndrill bit physically compatible with a conventional chuck.  The bit includes a pair of diametrically opposed, oppositely inclined recesses that cooperate with a crossbar member within a bit-receiving bore of the fitting.  When the aligned drill bit is\npressed into the fitting, the crossbar member cams along the inclined recesses causing the bit to rotate relative to the fitting.  The resulting frictional engagement between the recesses and the crossbar member, along with a detent assembly between the\nbit and the fitting, securely lock the bit onto the distal end of the fitting, yet render removal possible by the use of a removal tool.  The bone harvesting tool provides a non-disposable cutter.  Reuse of the cutter dulls the beveled lip edges. \nMoreover, the harvested bone collection central bore requires a thorough cleaning prior to each use, creating contamination possibilities.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,690,634 to Muller et al. discloses a medullary drill head.  This drill head for intramedullary drilling has a front part, a middle part and a rear part and is shaped as a hollow body of revolution.  The front and rear parts\nhave spiral slots formed with cutting edges.  The rear part has an attachment for coupling to a drilling shaft.  The drill head is not disposable, and as a result, the drill head is continuously reused, resulting in dulling of the cutting edges. \nMoreover, the drill head includes three openings in the form of spirally shaped slots configured to have cutting edges similar to a grater; and has no place to collect bone debris.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,954,671 to O'Neill discloses a bone harvesting method and apparatus.  This apparatus and method harvests bone using a manual, cylindrical, multi-directional coring device with a guided delivery system that can be inserted\nthrough a percutaneous or closed approach to extract precisely measured amounts of bone or bone marrow.  A series of guide wires, obturators, dilators and cannulas are used as the exposure and delivery instrumentation for a cutting tool.  The cutting\ntool has a tip with six cutting edges for cutting in all directions.  This apparatus is a manual, cylindrical, multi-directional coring device with a guided delivery system to extract precisely measured amounts of bone or bone marrow.  The cutter portion\nof the device is not disposable and is subject to wear and dull edges.  This coring device does not suggest a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,976,144 to Fishbein et al. discloses a hollow dome reamer with removable teeth.  This surgical reamer has a hollow dome with apertures spaced apart arranged in arcs extending from an apex of the dome to the base portion of the\ndome, and removable teeth positioned in the apertures.  Each cutting tooth has (i) a flange that is aligned flush with the external surface of the dome, (ii) a raised cutting edge extending above the flange and the external surface of the dome, and (iii)\nan interior passageway communicating between the outside and inside of the dome.  A base plate may be removably secured on the base portion of the dome to provide closure for the central cavity of the dome.  Although the teeth are removable, they are not\ndisposable in nature; the teeth are removed for replacement or for re-sharpening and are used again.  Removal of the small teeth may be cumbersome and difficult, and may even pose a danger during removal as the person removing the teeth may be cut by the\nsharp edges; replacement of the teeth into the apertures of the reamer will likely pose the same problems.  The bone debris is not collected away from the cutting edges of the teeth.  This hollow domed reamer is spherically shaped reamer; does not\nsuggest a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,980,170 to Salyer discloses a tool driver.  This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends.  A boss is secured at one of the shaft ends by which the tool driver is connected to a rotary tool.  A tool\ncollate is secured at the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be positioned.  The boss has a distal end surface with a groove therein.  Both the groove and the\ndistal end surface extend transversely of the axis.  A pin is positioned in the groove on the axis.  A latch mechanism is provided to hold a mounting bar of a rotary tool in the groove on the pin, whereby the rotary tool is held exactly coaxially of the\ndriver during use.  The rotary tool, which is used with the driver has a bar containing the same dimensions as the groove in the boss of the tool driver.  The bar thus fills and is complementary to the slot.  The bar has a hole therein which is\ncomplementary to the pin.  The pin extends coaxially of the shaft and the boss.  The bar hole in which the pin of the tool driver is positioned is precisely coaxial of the axis of the tool about which the cutting edges are precisely positioned.  The\ncutters are connected to the tip of the shaft and are spherical in nature for joint and patella reaming.  In addition, the reamer cups are not disposable in nature.  The bone fragments are not collected and kept away from the cutting edge.  This\nspherically shaped reamer is not tapered.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,193,722 to Zech et al. discloses a hollow milling tool.  The hollow milling tool produces substantially hollow cylindrical depressions in human or animal tissue.  It also produces tissue pillars, which are removed at a harvest\nlocation, transported to a defect location and implanted.  The hollow milling tool has teeth for the ablation of tissue which are arranged at the distal end of the milling tool at the end side.  Furthermore, the milling tool has passages for transporting\na cooling fluid to a cooling region of the milling tool lying near the distal end during the ablation of tissue.  Teeth are constructed within the milling tool for accomplishing the depressions.  These teeth will eventually need sharpening as the tool is\nused over time.  No structure is contained within the '722 patent that discloses or suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,332,886 to Green et al. discloses a surgical reamer and method of using same.  This device is used for expedited reaming of a medullary canal.  The device includes a reamer head connected at the distal end of a rotatable drive\nshaft.  The reamer head has a cutting head with five blades and flutes therebetween.  Each blade has a front cutting portion.  The blades can also include a side cutting portion.  The method for removing material from the medullary canal of a bone\nincludes the steps of reaming an area of the medullary canal to remove material; irrigating the material to be removed while reaming to reduce generation of heat and move removed material from the reaming area; and aspirating the removed material while\nreaming to create a negative intramedullary canal pressure to assist in the removal of the material.  The blades and flutes at the reamer are reused and are subject to dulling.  The bone chips are to be removed by the irrigating fluid, which means they\nare always present adjacent to the cutting portions and may be forced into the bone tissue.  No disclosure in the '886 patent suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,451,023 to Salazar et al. discloses a guide bushing for coring reamer, storage package for reamer assembly, and method of use.  This guide bushing for a coring reamer has a tapered member with its largest diameter at its first\nend so that the guide bushing frictionally engages an internal surface of the reamer with a line contact.  The guide bushing has a passage sized to slidably receive a guide pin.  In use, the bushing advances in the proximal direction within the coring\nreamer along a guide pin while the excavated bone enters the passageway through the reamer.  A storage package specifically designed for the reamer assembly is employed to remove the excavated bone from within the reamer.  The package has a closed distal\nend and an open proximal end closeable with a cap.  With the coring reamer received in cantilevered fashion through a central opening of the cap of the tube, and with an adapter that couples the coring reamer to a handpiece installed, a wrench is placed\nover the adapter and turned while the user grips peripheral surfaces of the cap to prevent rotation of the coring reamer.  A plunger is inserted through the opening and through the coring reamer from the proximal end.  The plunger is pushed through the\nreamer until the bone core and bushing fall out of the distal end of the coring reamer.  The guide bushing for a coring reamer is appointed with an open end surrounded by peripheral teeth.  The teeth are arranged peripheral to the body of the tube of the\nreamer.  The tube is hollow and therefore excavated bone accumulates therewithin.  The reamer, bushing and packaging are disposed of after use.  The '023 patent discloses a bone excavating tool that does not prepare bone canal for implantation of femoral\nimplants.  No structure is disclosed therein that suggests a tapered reamer.\n U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,074,224 to Daniels et al. discloses a modular tapered reamer for bone preparation and associated method.  This kit is for use in performing joint arthroplasty and includes a trial and a reamer.  The reamer is said to be useful\nwhen preparing a cavity in the intramedullary canal of a long bone with the use of a driver, and to assist in performing a trial reduction.  The reamer includes a first portion for placement at least partially in the cavity of the long bone and a second\nportion operably connected to the first portion.  The reamer is removably connected to the driver to rotate the reamer.  The trial is removably attachable to the reamer.  This tapered reamer is not disposable and does not have provision for accumulating\nbone debris away from the cutting portion of the bone.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0113836 to Lozier et al. discloses an expandable reamer.  This expandable reamer includes a cannulated shaft and a plurality of straight cutting blades having deformable points.  The blades are\nhingably outwardly rotatable at the deformation points between a contracted position and an expanded position.  In the contracted position, the blades are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cannulated shaft and, in the expanded\nposition, the blades have at least a portion oriented radially outward from the longitudinal axis, thereby forming a larger diameter cutting surface in the expanded position and in the contracted position.  The blades are formed from a portion of the\ncannulated shaft by, e.g. milling longitudinally extending slots through the wall of the cannulated shaft.  The slots serve as flutes dividing the cutting edge and trailing edge of each adjacent blade.  Each blade may also include more than one segment\narranged along its length, the segments being coupled by deformation points.  The expandable reamer may be used for cutting a cavity in a bone or other structure that is larger than the diameter of the entry point into the bone and greater than the\ndiameter of the contracted reamer.  The expandable reamer is not disposable.  Since the expandable blades are deformably attached to the cannulated shaft, the cut bone debris is not collected away from the bone cutting region.  As a result, fragments of\ncut bone debris may be pushed into the bone tissue by the deformable rotating blades.\n U.S.  Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0004371 to Williams et al. discloses an orthopedic reamer.  This orthopedic reamer is for use in creating and sizing canals in a bone.  The orthopedic reamer includes a non-polymeric cutting portion\nhaving at least one cutting surface thereon and a polymeric body portion covering at least a portion of the cutting portion.  The at least one cutting surface is not covered by the polymeric body portion.  The orthopedic reamer provides cutting\ncomponents including a blade or saw like construction, rather than the plurality of teeth.  Although the orthopedic reamer is appointed for disposability, the publication requires that the entire reamer, and not just the cutting portion, be disposed of. \nThat is to say, the entire reamer, including the non-polymeric cutting portion and the polymeric body portion of the device are all disposed of; not just the cutter.\n There remains a need in the art for a modular easy-to-assemble hollow tapered reamer for medical applications having a disposable hollow cutter assembly.  Also needed in the art is a disposable hollow cutter assembly of the type described, which\ncan be attached to a reusable shaft portion that provides means for reaming of the internal canal of bones.  Further needed in the art is a cutter assembly having means for collecting bone debris and keeping the collected debris displaced from the\ncutting edges, so that after one use of the reamer a new hollow cutter assembly can be utilized and the old hollow cutter assembly can be discarded.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a modular easy-to-assemble hollow tapered reamer for medical applications having a disposable cutter assembly.  The cutter assembly is attached to a reusable shaft portion of the reamer and has a space for bone\ndebris collection, which prevents inclusion of bone and bone cement debris into the living bone tissue.  The reusable shaft portion has an integral or user attachable conical section containing one or more slots that receive the disposable cutter and\nthereby transfer shaft torque to the cutter.  The reusable shaft is threaded at the distal end to secure the tapered hollow disposable cutter.  A threaded modular pilot is provided with a collet that mates with the tapered hollow disposable reamer,\nthereby producing substantial coincidence of alignment between the centerline of the reamer with that of the reusable shaft.  Preferably, a fresh tapered hollow reamer is used with each new application.  Alternatively, the tapered hollow reamer is used\nseveral times and, after it has become worn or dull, is discarded.  The tapered hollow reamer includes a plurality of apertures and is hollow to allow space between the reamer and the reusable shaft for bone and bone cement debris collection.  It is\nattached to a shaft using a modular pilot with a threaded connection.  When the modular pilot is tightened at the threaded end of the reusable shaft, the tapered collet of the modular pilot bears against the taper provided in the tapered hollow reamer,\nthereby causing substantially coincident alignment between the centerline of the reamer and that of the reusable shaft.  The reamer portion is prevented from free rotation by one or more slots in the shaft cone element and tabs in the tapered hollow\nreamer.  Torque from the shaft is transferred to the reamer, providing bone cutting action.  Thus when a drill or other hand machinery rotates the reusable shaft, the shaft torque is transferred to the reamer through the tabs while the reamer is held\nsecurely at the centerline of the rotating reusable shift preventing any wobbly motion.  This disposable sharp hollow reamer therefore reduces heat generated during cutting by removing the bone debris from the outer surface of the reamer to the inside of\nthe reamer, while the bone debris collected may be used later for bone grafting and other specific surgical procedures.  A further advantage of the hollow design is that by allowing the removal of the bone debris from the outer surface of the reamer to\nthe inside of the cutter, the reamer is less likely to raise the intramedulary pressure in the long bone being reamed, thereby lessening the chance of fat embolism during these procedures.  Also fragments of bone chips or bone cement are not incorporated\nin the living bone tissue by the reamer cutting action.\n Generally stated, the reamer for medical applications comprises: (a) a reamer reusable shaft having an elongated body with a proximal end, a conical central element and a distal end, said proximal end having a coupling portion appointed for\nattachment of said reamer to a drilling device, said distal end having a threaded portion; (b) said central portion of said reamer reusable shaft having a pre-assembled cone element or a modular user assembled cone element having two or more lateral\nslots; (c) a disposable tapered hollow reamer comprising: (1) a disposable hollow reamer sleeve portion having an outer surface, said disposable hollow reamer sleeve portion further comprising a plurality of cutting teeth and a plurality of apertures on\nsaid outer surface; and at least one torque transmitting tab integrally attached to said hollow cutter sleeve at a larger diameter end designed to engage with at least one slot of said shaft conical central element, thereby transferring torque from said\nreusable shaft to said hollow tapered reamer sleeve; (3) the smaller diameter end of the tapered hollow cutter sleeve having a collet taper; (d) a modular pilot with an external collet taper that engages said collet taper of said hollow tapered reamer\nsleeve and a female threaded aperture for engaging with the shaft distal end threads and centering said tapered hollow reamer sleeve during assembly.\n The present invention of modular tapered reamer solves the problems associated with the prior art reamers.  In accordance with the present invention, the modular tapered hollow reamer for medical applications has an easy-to-assemble disposable\nmodular hollow tapered reamer sleeve, which can be attached to a reusable shaft that allows for a fresh cutter assembly to be used with each new application of the reamer.  The modular tapered hollow reamer of the present invention transfers shaft torque\nreliably while at the same time maintains the centerline of the reamer preventing wobbliness thereof during cutting.  Bone and bone cement fragments are collected and stored away from the bone cutting area thereby reducing the possibility of bone\nfragment incorporation into living bone tissue.  The modular tapered hollow reamer gradually crates the bone cavity due to the taper provided, thereby reducing heat during its surgical usage.  Owing to the presence of these features, the modular tapered\nhollow reamer of this invention is safer to use and operates more efficiently than prior art reamers.

These procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Other surgical procedures that see the use of reamers include\ninternal fixation procedures for fractures.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer, illustrated in FIG. 1.  Prior art reamers typically include a driver coupling 11 (shown\nas a Jacob chuck connector), a size designation 12, a pilot tip 13, a shaft 14, and cutting flutes 15.  FIG. 1 shows a tapered reamer, however cylindrical reamers of similar design also exist in the prior art.  Those solid cylindrical or tapered reamers\ncurrently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper fit of the implant.  Conventional\nreamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient friction/heat to damage or\nkill the surrounding bone.  The bone or bone cement debris collected is pushed against the living bone tissue and may be incorporated into the bone.  Currently utilized solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore\nbecome less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.\n FIG. 2 depicts at 20 the modular disposable tapered hollow reamer assembly of the present invention, which provides the disposable hollow reamers appointed for use in medical applications.  Due to its taper, it gradually enlarges the diameter of\nthe bone canal reducing the amount of pressure applied to the bone.  A number of sizes of tapered hollow reamers are available along with their shafts and modular pilots so that the surgeon can choose progressively larger hollow tapered reamers for a\nfresh bone canal or a reworked bone canal.  Since the hollow reamer sleeves are disposable, the cutting performance of the hollow reamer is not compromised through repeated use.  Several limitations of the prior art reamers and consequent clinical\nproblems seen are overcome through utilization of the disposable modular tapered hollow reamers herein.  Novel design features of the hollow reamers of the present invention and improvements to prior art reamers are multifaceted.  The design includes a\nreusable shaft 23 with one or more lateral slots in a central conical section.  A disposable tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 is slid over the central conical section engaging torque transmitting tabs of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve with the slots. \nThe disposable tapered hollow reamer is held in place by the modular pilot 27, which is screwed into the threaded distal end of the shaft 23.  During this threaded attachment, a collet taper of disposable tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 engages with a\ncorresponding collet taper provided on the external surface of the modular pilot 27, substantially aligning the centerline of the disposable tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 with that of the reusable shaft 23.  The end of modular pilot 27 that is distal\nfrom the collet taper has a blunt or bullet shape, which facilitates centering of the tapered hollow reamer.  The male thread of the shaft distal end and the female central thread of the modular pilot may be provided with a left-handed thread, so that\nthe attachment does not come loose during the reaming operation.  The shaft 23 is attached to a drill at 21.  A number of shaft sizes can be selected from a kit and the shaft size is indicated at 22.  The drill depth is indicated by depth markings 24. \nShaft 23 has an integral or user attached cone section 25 and a disposable hollow reamer sleeve 26.  The modular pilot may carry indicia representing a shaft size to which it may be connected.  Preferably, the hollow reamer sleeve 26 is discarded after a\nsingle use to ensure a sharp cutter during surgery.  Alternatively, the hollow reamer sleeve 26 is used several times and after becoming worn is discarded.  Various techniques may be used to determine if the hollow reamer sleeve is worn enough to require\ndisposal.  Such techniques may include measurements of the sharpness of the hollow reamer sleeve.  Moreover, when dealing with revision hip surgery, the hollow reamers have also been designed to cut bone cement (PMMA) in a more efficient manner by\nproviding internal space 34 to capture the debris.  This feature reduces both the cutting temperature and time required to remove the remnant cement mantle.  The bone debris collected and removed may be used for bone grafting or other specific surgical\nprocedures.  A further advantage of the hollow design is that by allowing the removal of the bone debris from the outer surface of the reamer to the inside of the reamer, the reamer is less likely to raise the intramedulary pressure in the long bone\nbeing reamed, thereby lessening the chance of fat embolism during these procedures.\n FIG. 3 depicts at 30 the mechanical attachment details of the modular disposable tapered hollow reamer assembly.  Identical indicia are used to keep track of various components.  The reusable shaft 23 has the shaft cone element 25 with one or\nmore slots 31, one above and one below are shown.  The tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 has two torque transmitting tabs 32 engaging into the slots 31 of the shaft cone element 25.  As a result, when the shaft 23 is rotated, the tapered hollow reamer\nsleeve is also rotated with no slippage.  The distal end of the tapered hollow reamer is provided with a collet taper as shown at 37.  The distal end of the shaft 23 is threaded as shown at 35.  A modular pilot 27 has female threads 36 that mate with the\nshaft distal end threads.  The modular pilot has a collet taper at 38 that mates with the collet taper 37 of the tapered hollow reamer, centering the reamer as it is tightened.  The space 34 that is between tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 and the\nreusable shaft 23 receives the bone and bone cement debris.\n FIG. 4 illustrates in two views the design of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve.  FIG. 4A is a front view depicting the disposable hollow reamer which has one or more torque transmitting tabs (two shown in the drawing) on the larger diameter end\nand a collet taper in the smaller diameter end.  FIG. 4b shows a perspective view of the larger diameter end with two torque transmitting tabs.  FIGS. 4A and 4B depict at 26 the disposable hollow reamer sleeve, which comprises: (i) a disposable hollow\nreamer sleeve portion having an outer surface 41 having a hollow construction, the disposable hollow reamer sleeve portion further comprising a plurality of cutting teeth 42 and a plurality of apertures (also at 42) on the outer surface 41; (ii) a\nplurality (two shown) of torque transmitting tabs 43 integrally attached to the tapered hollow reamer; at the larger diameter end and (iii) a collet taper 44 on the smaller diameter end.  Preferably, the cutting teeth 42 protrude from the outer surface\nof the disposable hollow cutter sleeve, consequently forming the plurality of apertures.  Alternatively, the plurality of apertures can be separate and distinct from the cutting teeth on the outer surface of the disposable hollow cutter sleeve.\n The thickness of the hollow reamer sleeve portion should impart sufficient strength to withstand offset loads and axial loads on the reamer shaft during advancement of the cutter.  The amount of load that can be tolerated without warping or\nchanging the accuracy of the machined cavity can be determined by laboratory tests, which replicate clinical usage of the instrument.  Typically, the disposable hollow reamer sleeve portion has a wall thickness ranging from 0.005 to 0.039 inch. \nPreferably the wall thickness of the hollow reamer sleeve portion ranges from 0.010 to 0.032 inch, and most preferably from 0.012 to 0.015 inch.  These thickness facilitate cutting by a disposable, low cost, hollow reamer sleeve in an accurate, efficient\nand reliable manner.\n FIG. 5 illustrates a family of disposable tapered hollow sleeves provided.  The family of disposable tapered hollow sleeves provided according to the present invention addresses a wide range of bone sizes, including sizes ranging from 7 mm\nthrough 20 mm in one (1) mm increments; and being tapered and having a 7 mm tapering to a larger diameter in one (1) to three (3) mm increments and having size options from a 7 mm base dimension to a 20 mm base dimension in one (1) mm increments.\n Multiple disposable tapered hollow sleeves can be attached to a single shaft, as is illustrated in FIG. 6.  Preferably, a single shaft will attach to at least three different sized disposable hollow cutter assemblies.  This provides for the\nability to combine various sized shafts with various sized disposable hollow cutter assemblies.  These reusable reamer shafts have a coupling on the proximal end and a threaded portion in the distal end.  The shaft portion between the proximal end and\nthe central portion may be made flexible to facilitate insertion of the tapered hollow reamer.  Each reusable shaft has an integrally attached or user attachable modular cone element with one or more lateral slots for receiving the torque transmitting\ntabs of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve, as shown in FIG. 4B, and a threaded portion at the distal end for retaining the modular pilot in accordance with the invention.\n FIG. 7 provides an assembly view depicting the tapered hollow reamer assembly.  The assembled taped hollow reamer and the three component parts are shown.  The hollow reamer sleeve 26 is inserted over the cone section 31 of the reusable shaft 23\nwith the torque transmitting tabs of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 positioned within the shaft cone section lateral slots.  The modular pilot 27 is screwed on to the end of the reusable shaft, capturing the disposable tapered hollow reamer sleeve. \nThe collet taper is provided at the end portion of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve, and the modular pilot substantially aligns the centerline of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve with the centerline of the reusable shaft.\n FIG. 8 depicts an alternate embodiment of the tapered hollow reamer assembly.  Since the reusable shaft 23 has a coupling suited for attachment to a drill at the proximal end, it may be placed in a vice or chuck 81 to secure the reusable shaft\nin a vertical position, as shown.  Next the tapered hollow reamer sleeve 26 is inserted over the shaft as shown, engaging the torque transmitting tabs of the tapered hollow reamer sleeve with the lateral slots provided at the cone section 31 of the\nreusable shaft 23.  Next, the modular pilot is screwed into the threads at the distal end of the reusable shaft 23 and is tightened with a wrench 83.  The modular pilot may be provided with a set of notches to accommodate a wrench.  A handle 82 attached\nto the vice or chuck 81 provides support during this tightening procedure.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n",

 'patent_description': u'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n 1.  Field of the Invention\n The present invention relates to a hollow reamer for medical applications; and more particularly, to a hollow reamer having a disposable cutter assembly which can be attached to a reusable shaft portion.\n 2.  Description of the Prior Art\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  These procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Reamers are also used in procedures that involve the\ninternal fixation of fractures.  Prior art reamers typically fall into two major classes: rigid and flexible shaft.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer.  Solid\ncylindrical or tapered reamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper fit\nof the implant.  Conventional reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient\nfriction/heat to damage or kill the surrounding bone.  These prior art solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.\n There remains a need in the art for a hollow reamer for medical applications having a disposable hollow cutter assembly which can be attached to a reusable shaft portion that provides means for reaming of the internal canal of bones whereby\nafter one or more uses of the reamer a new hollow cutter assembly is utilized and the old hollow cutter assembly is discarded.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n The present invention provides a hollow reamer for medical applications having a disposable cutter assembly which can be attached to a reusable shaft portion.  Preferably, a fresh cutter assembly is used with each new application. \nAlternatively, the cutter assembly is used several times and, after it has become worn, is discarded.  The cutter assembly includes a plurality of apertures and is hollow to allow space for bone debris.  This therefore reduces heat generated during\ncutting by removing the bone debris from the outer surface of the cutter to the inside of the cutter, and further provides space for bone debris to be collected and later removed for bone grafting for the specific surgical procedure.  A further advantage\nof the hollow design is that by allowing the removal of the bone debris from the outer surface of the cutter to the inside of the cutter, the reamer is less likely to raise the intramedulary pressure in the long bone being reamed, thereby lessening the\nchance of fat embolism during these procedures.\n Generally stated, the reamer for medical applications comprises: (a) a shaft portion having an elongated body with a distal end and a proximal end, said distal end having a coupling portion appointed for attachment of said reamer to a drilling\ndevice, said proximal end having a threaded portion; and (b) a disposable hollow cutter assembly comprising: (1) a disposable hollow cutter sleeve portion having an outer surface and a hollow construction, said disposable hollow cutter sleeve portion\nfurther comprising a plurality of cutting teeth and a plurality of apertures on said outer surface; and (2) a pilot tip having a threaded inner surface and being attached to said disposable hollow cutter sleeve portion; said disposable hollow cutter\nassembly being adapted to slide over said proximal end of said elongated shaft portion and extend over a portion of said elongated body thereof, thereby enabling said pilot tip to be threaded with said threaded portion of said proximal end of said shaft\nportion.\n The present invention solves the problems associated with the reuse of prior art reamers.  In accordance with the present invention, the hollow reamer for medical applications has a disposable cutter assembly which can be attached to a reusable\nshaft portion that allows for a fresh cutter assembly to be used with each new application of the reamer.  The hollow reamer of the present invention reduces heat during its application and is more efficient and safe when compared to prior art reamers.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n The invention will be more fully understood and further advantages will become apparent when reference is had to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings, in which:\n FIG. 1 is a perspective view depicting a medical tapered reamer found in the prior art;\n FIG. 2 is a perspective view depicting a hollow tapered reamer in accordance with the invention;\n FIGS. 3A, 3B, 3C, collectively, provide an assembly view depicting the hollow reamer in FIG. 3A that is formed by the disposable hollow cutter in FIG. 3B and reusable shaft in FIG. 3C in accordance with the invention;\n FIG. 4A is a perspective view depicting the disposable hollow cutter in accordance with the invention;\n FIG. 4B is a side view depicting the disposable hollow cutter in accordance with the invention;\n FIG. 4C is a front view depicting the disposable hollow cutter in accordance with the invention;\n FIG. 5 is a perspective view depicting a family of disposable hollow cutters in accordance with the invention;\n FIG. 6 is a perspective view depicting the ability of a single reamer shaft to work with a plurality of various-sized disposable hollow cutters;\n FIG. 7 is a perspective view depicting a reusable shaft with a plurality of graduations to determine the depth of the disposable hollow cutter assembly in the canal of the bone during use;\n FIG. 8 is a perspective view depicting a hollow tapered reamer in accordance with the invention;\n FIG. 9 is a perspective view depicting a tapered portion of the elongated body of said shaft portion for securing said disposable hollow cutter assembly and a left-hand thread for assembly into the pilot tip;\n FIG. 10 is a perspective view depicting a coupling portion appointed for attachment of the reamer to a drilling device; and\n FIGS. 11A and 11B each show a perspective view depicting a break-away feature of the pilot tip during disassembly to prevent reuse of the disposable hollow cutter.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery.  These procedures include hip replacement, knee replacement and shoulder replacement.  Other surgical procedures that see the use of reamers\ninclude internal fixation procedures for fractures.  Typically, reaming of the internal bone canal is achieved through utilization of a solid cylindrical or tapered reamer, illustrated in FIG. 1.  Prior art reamers typically include a driver coupling 11\n(shown as a Jacob chuck connector), a size designation 12, a pilot tip 13, a shaft 14, and cutting flutes 15.  FIG. 1 shows a tapered reamer, however cylindrical reamers of similar design also exist in the prior art.  Those solid cylindrical or tapered\nreamers currently utilized are required to cut both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).  Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient cutter to machine the canal for a proper fit of the implant. \nConventional reamers can cut cortical bone initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.  Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone cutting and in addition generates sufficient friction/heat to\ndamage or kill the surrounding bone.  Currently utilized solid cylindrical or tapered reamers are intended for multiple uses and therefore become less efficient after each surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis.\n FIG. 2 depicts the hollow reamer assembly of the present invention which provides hollow reamers appointed for use in medical applications.  The hollow cutter assemblies are disposable, so that the cutting performance of the hollow reamer is not\ncompromised through repeated use.  Several improvements towards the clinical problems seen with prior art reamers are overcome through utilization of the hollow reamers herein.  Novel design features of the hollow reamers of the present invention and\nimprovements to prior art reamers are multifaceted and include a reusable shaft 22 with a disposable hollow cutter assembly 21.  Preferably, the hollow cutter assembly 21 is discarded after a single use to ensure a sharp cutter during surgery. \nAlternatively, the hollow cutter assembly is used several times and after becoming worn is discarded.  Various techniques may be used to determine if the hollow cutter assembly is worn enough that it requires disposal.  Such techniques may include\nmeasurements of the sharpness of the cutter assembly.  Moreover, when dealing with revision hip surgery, the hollow reamers have also been designed to cut bone cement (PMMA) in a more efficient manner by providing internal space to capture the debris and\nthereby reducing both the cutting temperature and time required to remove the remnant cement mantle.  Both these features are important in reducing heat to the bone and reducing O.R.  (operating room) time required for revision surgery.  FIG. 2\nillustrates a hollow reamer having a tapered cutter portion of the present invention.  Alternatively, a hollow reamer having a cylindrical design may be utilized.  The hollow reamer comprises a shaft portion 22 and a disposable hollow cutter assembly 21. The shaft portion 22 can either be solid or cannulated.\n FIGS. 3A, 3B, 3C, collectively, provide an assembly view depicting the hollow reamer in FIG. 3A that is formed by the disposable hollow cutter in FIG. 3B and reusable shaft in FIG. 3C in accordance with the invention.  FIG. 3A depicts the\nmodular design of the hollow reamer at 31.  FIG. 3C depicts a reusable reamer shaft 22.  The reamer shaft 22 may be flexible or rigid depending on the particular medical application.  FIG. 3B depicts a disposable, one-time use hollow cutter assembly 21.\n FIG. 4A is a perspective view depicting the disposable hollow cutter in accordance with the invention.  FIG. 4B is a side view depicting the disposable hollow cutter in accordance with the invention.  FIG. 4C is a front view depicting the\ndisposable hollow cutter in accordance with the invention.  FIG. 4C depicts the disposable hollow cutter assembly which comprises: (i) a disposable hollow cutter sleeve portion having an outer surface and a hollow construction, the disposable hollow\ncutter sleeve portion further comprising a plurality of cutting teeth 41 and a plurality of apertures (also at 41) on the outer surface; and (ii) a pilot tip 43 having a threaded inner surface and being attached to the disposable hollow cutter sleeve\nportion.  The non-cutting pilot tip 43 is designed for guidance, and the tip 43 matches the diameter of the previous cutter sleeve end to achieve this guidance feature.  The pilot tip 43 further helps to keep each successive reamer centered, thereby\nresisting the tendency of the reamer to drift and cut eccentrically, particularly when there is eccentric cement in the canal.  Preferably, the pilot tip 43 is tapered at about the same angle as the hollow cutter sleeve.  Alternatively, the pilot tip 43\nis generally cylindrical.  Preferably, the hollow cutter assembly is discarded after a single use to ensure a sharp, efficient cutter for every surgery.  Alternatively, the hollow cutter assembly is used several times and, upon becoming worn, is\ndiscarded.  FIG. 4B further depicts the hollow cutter which provides space 42 for bone debris offering multiple benefits, including reducing heat generated during cutting by removing the bone debris from the outer surface of the cutter to the inside of\nthe cutter and providing space 42 for bone debris to be collected and later removed for bone grafting for the specific surgical procedure.  A further advantage of the hollow design is that by allowing the removal of the bone debris from the outer surface\nof the cutter to the inside of the cutter, the reamer is less likely to raise the intramedulary pressure in the long bone being reamed, thereby lessening the chance of fat embolism during these procedures.  The hollow cutter sleeve is provided with a\nplurality of apertures 41 on its outer surface.  Preferably, the cutting teeth 41 protrude from the outer surface of the disposable hollow cutter sleeve, consequently forming the plurality of apertures.  Alternatively, the plurality of apertures can be\nseparate and distinct from the cutting teeth on the outer surface of the disposable hollow cutter sleeve.\n FIG. 5 illustrates a family of disposable cutter assemblies.  The family of disposable cutter assemblies addresses a wide range of bone sizes, including sizes ranging from 7 mm through 20 mm in one (1) mm increments; and being tapered and having\na 7 mm tapering to a larger diameter in one (1) to three (3) mm increments and having size options from a 7 mm base dimension to a 20 mm base dimension in one (1) mm increments.  Preferably, and as shown in FIG. 5, the hollow cutter assemblies are\ntapered.  Alternatively, the hollow cutter assemblies are cylindrical and have diameters ranging from 7 mm through 20 mm.  Preferably, there are provided two shafts of each size in the instrument set, thereby allowing the surgeon to go back one size\nduring the procedure, if necessary, without having to break off the disposable cutter.\n Multiple disposable cutter assemblies can be attached to a single shaft, as is illustrated in FIG. 6.  Preferably, a single shaft will attach to at least three different sized disposable hollow cutter assemblies.  This provides for the ability\nto combine various sized shafts with various sized disposable hollow cutter assemblies.\n FIG. 7 shows the reamer shaft appointed with graduated markings 72.  The reamer shaft incorporates graduations 72 to determine the depth of insertion of the cutter assembly into the canal of the bone.  The reamer shaft further incorporates\nmarkings 71 to identify the proper assembly between the shaft and the cutter assembly.  Alternatively, this method could be further enhanced through color coding the shafts and the disposable hollow cutters.  A shaft size designation marking 71 informs\nthe user as to what sized disposable hollow cutter assemblies will fit the shaft.  A cutter assembly size designation 73 is indicated on the pilot tip of the disposable hollow cutter assembly.\n FIG. 8 illustrates the shaft cutter assembly, showing flats on the reamer shaft end and flats on the disposable cutter assembly pilot tip, which are provided to facilitate assembly of the disposable hollow cutter assembly to the shaft using\nsimple wrenches found in the prior art.\n FIG. 9 shows an embodiment of the shaft/disposable hollow cutter assembly wherein the inner surface of the pilot tip 93 is threaded.  One method for assembling the disposable cutter assembly 91 to the shaft incorporates a left-hand thread on the\nend of the shaft and a left-hand thread in the inner surface of the pilot tip of the disposable hollow cutter assembly.  With this assembly arrangement, the assembly tightens during operation (hand or power reaming is right-hand rotation) thereby\nproviding stability of the cutter assembly 91 to the shaft.  The assembly method between the reamer shaft and the disposable cutter assembly 91 is further shown in FIG. 9, where the reamer shaft has a taper 92 incorporated into the body of the shaft,\nwhich closely mates with the internal taper of the hollow disposable cutter sleeve 91, thereby establishing stability to the opposite end of the cutter from the thread attachment.\n FIG. 10 illustrates the shaft drive coupling.  A reamer shaft having a driver end 101 compatible with currently available hand and power instruments in the medical field is provided.  The hollow reamer could also be coupled with a flexible drive\nshaft.\n FIGS. 11A and 11B each illustrate an alternative embodiment of the disposable hollow cutter assembly which incorporates a disposable hollow cutter break-away feature which prevents reuse of the disposable hollow cutter assembly.  The pilot tip\n111 of the disposable hollow cutter assembly includes a flat portion 112 in order to enable the assembly and disassembly of the disposable hollow cutter assembly to the shaft by using a simple wrench or the like.  The disposable hollow cutter assembly is\nassembled with a wrench.  Following use of the disposable hollow cutter assembly, it is disassembled from the shaft by using the wrench.  The disposable hollow cutter assembly is preferably manufactured in such a manner so that the break away torque that\nis required for disassembling the disposable hollow cutter assembly from the shaft will cause the pilot tip 113 to shear away from the hollow cutter sleeve portion.  Then, the pilot tip may be unthreaded from the drive shaft, and the hollow cutter sleeve\nportion may be slid off the end of the shaft.  Once the reamer is disassembled in this manner, the disposable hollow cutter assembly can not be reused.  Therefore, the optional break away feature prevents the re-use of the same disposable hollow cutter\nassembly, thereby assuring the proper function that can only be provided by the use of a new disposable hollow cutter assembly.\n Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within\nthe scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.\n* * * * *\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     \n\n\n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n',
