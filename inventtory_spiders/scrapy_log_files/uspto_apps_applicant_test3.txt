 'patent_description': u'FIELD\n[0001] The present disclosure concerns embodiments of a femoral hip\n     implant and methods for implanting femoral hip implants.\nBACKGROUND\n[0002] In total hip replacement, there are several designs which address\n     different indications for hip replacement depending on the quality and\n     geometry of the patient\'s bones. Hip implants generally replace the\n     femoral head and the acetabular socket with the objectives of restoring\n     stable pain-free motion. There are several different designs of femoral\n     components. In some designs, just the surface of the femoral head is\n     replaced, while other designs are composed of a stem and head-neck\n     section.\n[0003] With resurfacing designed femoral components, minimal bone is\n     removed; however complications with implant loosening can occur due to\n     the ability of the bone to support the implant. With the stemmed femoral\n     components, the implant is fixed within the canal of the femur. The\n     effectiveness of this design is dependent, at least in part, on the\n     strength of the cancellous bone within the canal of the femur. Without\n     proper strength, the stem can subside (sink) further into the canal\n     creating instability and, in some cases, fractures. Both scenarios can\n     result in undesirable revision surgery.\nSUMMARY\n[0004] In one embodiment, a bone implant apparatus is provided. The\n     apparatus includes a proximal end portion, a central tapered body with a\n     distal end portion, and a circumferential collar positioned between the\n     proximal end portion and the distal end portion of the central tapered\n     body. The circumferential collar comprises a porous material capable of\n     allowing bone ingrowth into the collar. A distally-extending portion\n     extending from the collar toward the distal end portion can also be\n     formed of a porous material capable of allowing bone ingrowth into the\n     distally-extending portion. The central tapered body can tapers from the\n     distally-extending portion to the distal end portion.\n[0005] In some implementations, the proximal end portion can be integral\n     with the distal end portion forming a main shaft, and the collar is\n     secured to the main shaft between the proximal and distal end portions.\n     The distally-extending portion can be a porous body disposed\n     circumferentially around the main shaft distal to the circumferential\n     collar. The circumferential collar further can include a substantially\n     spherical distal surface. The distal end portion of the apparatus can be\n     substantially smooth and formed of a material that restricts bone\n     ingrowth. In some implementations, the proximal end portion can be\n     tapered, with the proximal end portion being at its widest in the\n     vicinity of the collar and at its narrowest furthest from the collar.\n[0006] In some embodiments, the bone implant apparatus is configured to be\n     implanted without using any cement or other bonding agents to bond the\n     implant to the bone of the femur. The bone implant apparatus can also be\n     sized to be sufficiently long so that at least a portion of the distal\n     end portion extends through a lateral cortex of a femur of a subject when\n     implanted therein.\n[0007] In another embodiment, a method for total hip replacement is\n     provided. The method can include inserting a pin into a neck of a femur\n     and through a lateral cortex of the femur to create an opening in the\n     femur and provide a guide for a cannulated cutter, forming an enlarged\n     opening in the femur by passing the cannulated cutter over the pin, and\n     inserting an implant into the enlarged opening created by the cannulated\n     cutter. The cannulated cutter can include a distal cylindrical cutting\n     portion, a tapered central cutting portion, and a proximal spherical\n     cutting portion.\n[0008] During implantation, the pin can be oriented at substantially the\n     same angle as the true neck of the femur. The implant can have a proximal\n     end portion, a distal end portion, and a circumferential collar\n     positioned therebetween. The circumferential collar can have a\n     substantially spherical distal surface and as the cannulated cutter\n     passes over the pin to enlarge the opening in the femur, the proximal\n     spherical cutting portion can form a surface in the femur that is sized\n     to receive the spherical distal surface of the collar. The\n     circumferential collar can comprise a porous material capable of allowing\n     bone ingrowth into the collar when the implant is received in the\n     enlarged opening.\n[0009] In some implementations, the inserting of the implant into the\n     enlarged opening can include press-fitting the implant into the enlarged\n     opening. The implant can compress the cancellous bone to provide\n     fixation. In other implementations, the forming of the enlarged opening\n     can include passing the distal cylindrical cutting portion through a\n     lateral cortex of the femur, and the inserting of the implant into the\n     enlarged opening can include causing a distal end portion of the implant\n     to extend out of the lateral cortex of the femur. The distal end portion\n     of the implant can at least partially contact the cortical bone of the\n     lateral cortex to help provide stability of the implant. In some\n     implementations, both ends of the implant can be supported by cortical\n     bone, with a distal end of the implant contacting cortical bone in the\n     vicinity of the lateral cortex and a proximal end of the implant\n     contacting cortical bone in the neck of the femur.\n[0010] The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the\n     invention will become more apparent from the following detailed\n     description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0011] FIG. 1A is an isometric view of a femoral hip implant.\n[0012] FIG. 1B is a side elevation view of a femoral hip implant.\n[0013] FIG. 1C is a cross-sectional view of a femoral hip implant, taken\n     along line 1C-1C in FIG. 1B.\n[0014] FIG. 2 is a side elevation view of a femoral implant in place in a\n     femur.\n[0015] FIG. 3 is a partial cross-sectional view of a femoral implant in\n     place in a femur.\n[0016] FIG. 4 is a side elevation view showing insertion of a pin into a\n     femur in preparation for placing a femoral implant.\n[0017] FIG. 5A is a side elevation view of a cannulated compound cutter.\n[0018] FIG. 5B is an enlarged view of the cannulated compound cutter shown\n     in FIG. 4, showing three separate cutting geometries.\n[0019] FIG. 6A is a side elevation view showing insertion of a pin into a\n     femur in preparation for insertion of a femoral implant into the femur.\n[0020] FIG. 6B is a side elevation view showing preparation of a femur\n     with a cannulated compound cutter passed over a pin to enlarge an opening\n     for installation of a femoral implant.\n[0021] FIG. 6C is a side elevation view showing a femoral implant\n     installed in a femur.\n[0022] FIG. 7 is a side view of a hip implant system, including a femoral\n     hip implant, a head that can be attached to the femoral hip implant, and\n     an acetabular cup.\n[0023] FIG. 8 is an exploded view of the hip implant system shown in FIG.\n     7.\n[0024] FIG. 9 is a partial cross-sectional view of the hip implant system\n     shown in FIG. 7, illustrated as implanted within a femur.\n[0025] FIG. 10 is a side view of a hip implant system.\n[0026] FIG. 11 is a front perspective view of the hip implant system shown\n     in FIG. 10.\n[0027] FIG. 12 is a bottom view of the hip implant system shown in FIG.\n     10.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n[0028] For purposes of this description, certain aspects, advantages, and\n     novel features of the embodiments of this disclosure are described\n     herein. The disclosed methods, apparatuses, and systems should not be\n     construed as limiting in any way. Instead, the present disclosure is\n     directed toward all novel and nonobvious features and aspects of the\n     various disclosed embodiments, alone and in various combinations and\n     sub-combinations with one another. The methods, apparatus, and systems\n     are not limited to any specific aspect or feature or combination thereof,\n     nor do the disclosed embodiments require that any one or more specific\n     advantages be present or problems be solved.\n[0029] Although the operations of some of the disclosed methods are\n     described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation,\n     it should be understood that this manner of description encompasses\n     rearrangement, unless a particular ordering is required by specific\n     language set forth below. For example, operations described sequentially\n     may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently. Moreover, for\n     the sake of simplicity, the attached figures may not show the various\n     ways in which the disclosed methods can be used in conjunction with other\n     methods. Additionally, the description sometimes uses terms like\n     "provide" or "achieve" to describe the disclosed methods. These terms are\n     high-level abstractions of the actual operations that are performed. The\n     actual operations that correspond to these terms may vary depending on\n     the particular implementation and are readily discernible by one of\n     ordinary skill in the art.\n[0030] As used in this application and in the claims, the singular forms\n     "a," "an," and "the" include the plural forms unless the context clearly\n     dictates otherwise. Additionally, the term "includes" means "comprises."\n     Further, the terms "coupled" and "associated" generally mean\n     electrically, electromagnetically, and/or physically (e.g., mechanically\n     or chemically) coupled or linked and does not exclude the presence of\n     intermediate elements between the coupled or associated items absent\n     specific contrary language.\n[0031] As used herein, the term "porous" means a structure having one or\n     more openings, gaps, or other such surfaces that allow bone to grow into\n     the structure and mechanically interlock with the structure. "Bone\n     ingrowth" refers to the growing of bone into a porous structure in a\n     manner that allows the bone to interlock with the structure. "Bone\n     ongrowth" refers to the growing of bone on a surface of a structure in a\n     manner so that the bone growth contacts the structure without generally\n     interlocking with that structure.\n[0032] The femoral hip implants and methods of use disclosed herein\n     provide improved femoral implant fixation. In particular, instead of\n     relying solely on softer cancellous bone, the femoral hip implants\n     disclosed herein can interact with harder cortical bone to provide\n     improved stability. In addition, at least in some embodiments, the\n     disclosed femoral hip implants provide a bone conserving approach,\n     reducing the amount of bone that is removed and the occurrence of\n     complications common with conventional hip implants.\n[0033] FIGS. 1A-1C depict an embodiment of a femoral hip implant 10.\n     Femoral hip implant 10 comprises a proximal end 12, a centrally tapered\n     body 14 with a distal end 16, and a circumferential collar 18 positioned\n     between proximal end 12 and centrally tapered body 14. Proximal end 12,\n     centrally tapered body 14, and collar 18 can be integrally formed as a\n     single structure.\n[0034] Collar 18 can comprise a substantially spherical distal surface 20.\n     The spherical surface of the collar can provide improved stress\n     distribution. With a flat collar, when the implant is loaded, the contact\n     quickly becomes highly focused around a small point leading to high\n     stresses. The spherical collar provides for better stress distribution\n     through a larger area contact at loading.\n[0035] Collar 18 can comprise a generally porous material to allow for\n     bone ingrowth into collar 18. As shown in FIGS. 1 A-1 C, collar 18 can\n     have a distally-extending portion 22 of porous material.\n     Distally-extending portion 22 preferably tapers in the same manner as\n     tapered body 14, forming one generally contiguous tapered shape. As noted\n     above, implant 10 can be formed as a single integral structure. However,\n     if desired, portions of the implant can be formed separate from the main\n     body of the implant and coupled together. For example, distally-extending\n     portion 22 can be formed as part of a collar that can be separately\n     attached to the implant.\n[0036] FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate femoral hip implant 10 fixed within a\n     femur of a subject. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, when implanted into a\n     subject, distal end 16 of femoral hip implant 10 extends out the lateral\n     cortex 24 of the femur 26, while proximal end 12 of femoral hip implant\n     10 extends out of the neck 28 of the femur 26. Thus, collar 18 provides\n     proximal support for the implant utilizing the cortical bone of the\n     femoral neck 28, and spherical distal surface 20 of the circumferential\n     collar 18 provides for stress distribution across a large area, reducing\n     the formation of stress concentrations in bone that is in the vicinity of\n     collar 18. Since both ends (i.e., distal end 16 and proximal end 12) of\n     the femoral hip implant utilize cortical bone as primary support and\n     cancellous bone as secondary support, femoral hip implant 10 can achieve\n     greater stability over conventional designs that rely primarily on\n     cancellous bone for support of an implant.\n[0037] As noted above, collar 18 can be made from a substantially porous\n     material to allow bone ingrowth for long-term stability of the implant.\n     Additionally, distally-extending portion 22 can also be made of porous\n     material to promote stability of the implant by allowing for bone\n     ingrowth along at least a portion of femoral hip implant 10 deeper into\n     the neck 28 of the femur 26. Distal end 16 can be smooth or polished to\n     inhibit bone fixation, allowing the implant to transfer stress to the\n     femoral neck 28 through the circumferential collar 18 while providing end\n     support on the cortical bone of the lateral cortex 24. In addition, by\n     having a portion that inhibits bone ingrowth, the effects of stress\n     shielding can be reduced. Devices which are too stiff or allow for bone\n     attachment throughout their length can cause stress shielding, which can\n     result in bone resorption and loosening of the implant.\n[0038] Femoral hip implant 10 can achieve both short-term and long-term\n     stability. For example, immediate stability (i.e., 6-8 weeks\n     post-operatively) is achieved by at least the following features: (1) the\n     spherical collar providing proximal support through the cortical bone of\n     the femoral neck; (2) the distal polished tip providing support as it\n     extends through the lateral cortex of the femur; and (3) the use of the\n     central tapered body as a secondary fixation feature, instead of a\n     primary fixation feature. Although the central tapered body exerts some\n     compressive force on the cancellous bone within the neck of the femur,\n     the forces on the cancellous bone are significantly reduced compared to\n     conventional devices.\n[0039] Long-term stability can be achieved by the same features as noted\n     above for immediate stability, along with additional features provided by\n     bone ingrowth into the implant and stress transfer to the proximal neck\n     area. For example, at least some additional features that enhance\n     long-term stability include (1) the fully porous collar that helps to\n     stress the proximal femoral bone and provide ingrowth; (2) the porous\n     distally-extending portion below the collar that provides for additional\n     bone ingrowth; and (3) the smooth, polished distal tip which passes\n     through the lateral cortex providing end support to the implant and\n     transferring stress to the femoral neck through the collar.\n[0040] Accordingly, the femoral hip implant described herein allows for\n     greater stability by providing specific bone ingrowth areas at or near\n     the femoral neck 28 to allow for bone fixation, while also providing\n     non-ingrowth areas such that stress is transmitted through the implant to\n     the bone at the bone ingrowth areas, as shown in FIG. 3.\n[0041] FIGS. 4-6C illustrate an approach for preparing bone for receiving\n     an implant, such as femoral hip implant 10. Conventional femoral implant\n     designs generally require multiple instruments to prepare bone for\n     receiving an implant, which can lead to inaccuracies as each sequential\n     step can accumulate errors and jeopardize the fit of the implant. To\n     reduce these errors, the following method for preparing bone utilizes a\n     biomechanical axial datum a single preparation (i.e., cutting) tool. This\n     approach can provide very precise implant dimensions, allowing for highly\n     repeatable and accurate press-fitting of implants within the bone.\n[0042] A femoral hip implant (e.g., femoral hip implant 10) is preferably\n     oriented generally parallel to the true neck of the femur. This\n     orientation can be facilitated by using a pin 30 driven through the\n     femoral neck 28 of the femur 26, and then out the lateral cortex 24, as\n     shown in FIG. 4. The pin 30 can be oriented along the axis of the femoral\n     neck, creating an angle 32 with the longitudinal axis of the femur 34.\n     The pin 30 can then be used as a datum to guide a cannulated compound\n     cutter 36 (FIG. 5A), which preferably prepares the femur in one step for\n     the implant. The cutter can be driven by hand or power, and can be\n     composed of three distinct cutting geometries: a spherical proximal\n     cutter 38, a tapered central cutter 40 (tapered towards the distal end),\n     and a cylindrical distal cutter 42, as shown in the enlarged view of\n     cutter 36 in FIG. 5B.\n[0043] As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, after insertion the pin 30 into the\n     femur 26, cutter 36 can be slipped over pin 30 and advanced into the bone\n     through the femoral neck 28 and out the lateral cortex 24, thereby\n     creating an opening or hole. The opening generally approximates the shape\n     of the outer surfaces of the implant; however, the opening is preferably\n     a smaller than the size required by the implant to achieve a tight fit of\n     the implant into the opening. The femoral hip implant 10 can then be\n     press-fitted into the opening, as shown in FIG. 6C. If a greater\n     interference fit is desired, less bone can be removed by cutter 36. For\n     example, in one embodiment, a separate spherical cutter can be used to\n     remove bone at the neck area only, greatly increasing the press fit of\n     the implant.\n[0044] In some embodiments, the femoral hip implants described herein can\n     be implanted without using any cement to achieve temporary or permanent\n     stability. For example, the above-described embodiments provide implants\n     that can be press-fitted into bone, with the implant configured to allow\n     bone to grow into the implant through one or more porous portions and\n     attach to the implant. Thus, the implants described herein and the\n     methods of use can, in some embodiments, be secured using press-fitting\n     techniques and can be cement-free implants.\n[0045] FIGS. 7-9 illustrate embodiments with a head 50 inserted onto\n     proximal end 12 of femoral hip implant 10. Head 50 is inserted into a cup\n     implant 52, which is inserted into the acetabulum (pelvic bone) of a\n     subject. The femoral hip implant 10 can be used with a variety of head\n     and cup systems in the manner shown in FIGS. 7-9. Cup implants and heads\n     can vary in size to accommodate the particular geometry of the subject.\n     For example, cup implants, in some embodiments, can be provided in sizes\n     that vary from 20-34 mm in size and the heads, in some embodiments, can\n     be provided in sizes from 12 mm to 26 mm. Of course, other sizes are\n     envisioned and can be desirable if the geometry of the subject requires\n     larger or smaller cup implants and heads.\n[0046] FIGS. 10-12 illustrate another embodiment of a femoral hip implant\n     110. Femoral hip implant 110 is similar to femoral hip implant 10;\n     however, femoral hip implant 110 is configured to allow bone\n     ongrowth--instead of ingrowth--on one or more areas of the implant.\n     Femoral hip implant 110 comprises a proximal end 112, a centrally tapered\n     body 114 with a distal end 116, and a circumferential collar 118 between\n     proximal end 112 and centrally tapered body 114. Collar 118 can comprise\n     a substantially spherical distal surface 120. As discussed above, the\n     spherical surface of the collar can provide improved stress distribution.\n[0047] Spherical distal surface 120 can be textured to encourage bone\n     ongrowth. FIGS. 10-12 illustrate an embodiment in which the surface 120\n     is macro-textured. In some embodiments, this texture can comprise a\n     plurality of indentations that are sized to allow growth of bone into the\n     indentations or dimples to restrict movement of implant 110 after\n     implantation. In some embodiments, centrally tapered body 114 can also\n     have a portion that allows bone on growth. Thus, for example, centrally\n     tapered body 114 can also have a plurality indentations, such as the\n     grooves indicated in FIG. 11, that allow for bone ongrowth. Proximal and\n     distal ends 112, 116 can comprise solid surfaces, such as a smooth\n     polished surface. These surfaces preferably restrict bone ingrowth or\n     ongrowth.\n[0048] To further promote bone growth (i.e., ongrowth or ingrowth) where\n     desired, portions of the implants described herein can be coated with\n     hydroxyapatite (HA) or other coatings that can increase or facilitate\n     bone growth on the implant.\n[0049] The implants described herein can be formed of various\n     biocompatible materials. In some embodiments, the implants can be formed\n     of titanium alloys, such as ASTM F-136 (Ti6A14V ELI Titanium Alloy). In\n     other embodiments, the implants can be formed using other biocompatible\n     materials, such as cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and various\n     composite materials or plastics.\n[0050] The porous portions of the implant described herein can be formed\n     in various ways. For example, in one embodiment, the implant can be\n     formed using additive manufacturing techniques. Additive manufacturing\n     techniques can include electron beam melting (EEM) whereby the implant\n     can be produced by building the implant layer-by-layer from metal powder\n     (e.g., a titanium alloy powder) using a powerful electron beam. Another\n     additive manufacturing technique that can be used to produce the implants\n     described herein is laser-sintering, such as that provided by EOS GmbH in\n     Munich, Germany. These techniques can be used to produce an implant with\n     the desired porous portions (for bone ingrowth) or indentations (for bone\n     ongrowth), as well as the other portions of the implant which are\n     intended to restrict bone in-growth and on-growth.\n[0051] The implants described herein can also be produced using other more\n     conventional techniques, including, for example, conventional machining\n     processes. In some embodiments, for example, the porous portions of the\n     implant can be created by layering a plurality of beads (or other\n     elements) on top of one another to create a plurality of layers of beads.\n     The beads can be fused to one another and to the implant body to form\n     gaps into which bone can grow.\n[0052] In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of\n     the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the\n     illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and\n     should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention. Rather, the\n     scope of the invention is defined by the following claims. We therefore\n     claim as our invention all that comes within the scope and spirit of\n     these claims.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

Such procedures often involve the use of\n     specific cutting tools. For example, in some procedures, specific cutting\n     tools can be provided to ream the internal canal of bones for preparation\n     of implants or to ream the outer surfaces of bones for preparation of\n     implants and drilling holes for bone screw fixation. Conventional cutting\n     tools, however, generally provide no mechanism for identifying the\n     quality or state of the cutting tool. As a result, many cutting tools are\n     disadvantageously used until they no longer function properly.\nSUMMARY\n[0004] Various systems and methods for providing quality control of\n     cutting tools are described herein. In some embodiments, the number of\n     uses of cutting tools can be restricted to ensure the quality of the\n     cutting tool prior to its use for its intended purpose. In other\n     embodiments, the effective functional life of cutting tools can be\n     analyzed and determined to ensure that the number of uses of the tool do\n     not exceed the tool\'s effective functional life.\n[0005] In one embodiment, a cutting tool has a cutting surface on a first\n     side of the cutting tool and an attachment member on a second side of the\n     cutting tool. The attachment member is configured to be coupled to a\n     powered driving member. The cutting tool includes a limiting device\n     configured to restrict the use of the cutting tool to a predetermined\n     number of uses. In some embodiments, the limiting device can be\n     configured to restrict the number of uses of the cutting tool by\n     restricting the number of times that the attachment member can be coupled\n     to the powered driving member.\n[0006] The limiting device can include a counter that is configured to\n     move to a new position each time the attachment member is coupled to the\n     powered driving member. The limiting device can include an activation\n     member having a projection that is configured to engage with a surface of\n     the powered driving member and a surface configured to engage with the\n     counter. The activation member can be configured to move between a first\n     position when the attachment member is not coupled to the powered driving\n     member and a second position when the attachment member is coupled to the\n     powered driving member.\n[0007] In some embodiments, a spring member can be provided in contact\n     with the activation member to bias the activation member back towards the\n     first position. The attachment member can include a cross bar that\n     extends across the second side of the cutting tool. The cross bar can\n     have an extension member that extends from a surface of the cross bar.\n     The counter can include an opening that extends at least partly through a\n     portion of the counter, with the extension member being positioned to\n     extend through the opening. The counter can be configured to rotate with\n     the extension member extending through the opening until the extension\n     member contacts a side wall that defines a portion of the opening. The\n     opening can be sized to allow a predetermined number of incremental\n     rotations of the counter relative to the cross bar until the extension\n     member contacts the side wall and restricts further movement of the\n     counter relative to the cross bar.\n[0008] In some embodiments, the first and second sides are on opposite\n     sides of the cutting tool. In some embodiments, the cutting tool can be\n     an acetabular reamer. In some embodiments, the predetermined number of\n     uses can be representative of the effective functional life of the\n     cutting tool. In some embodiments, the counter comprises a longitudinally\n     moveable member.\n[0009] In another embodiment, a cutting system is provided. The system can\n     include a cutting tool and a drive shaft. The cutting tool can include a\n     cutting surface on a first side of the cutting tool and an attachment\n     member on a second side of the cutting tool. The drive shaft can include\n     a receiving area and a coupling member, with the receiving area being\n     configured to receive the attachment member and the coupling member being\n     configured to secure the cutting tool to the drive shaft. The cutting\n     tool can include an integrated limiting device configured to restrict the\n     number of uses of the cutting tool by restricting the number of times\n     that the attachment member can be coupled to the powered driving member.\n     In some embodiments, the cutting tool can be an acetabular reamer and the\n     drive shaft can be a reamer shaft.\n[0010] The limiting device can include a counter member that is configured\n     to rotate and/or translate longitudinally one increment to a new position\n     each time the attachment member is coupled to the drive shaft. The\n     limiting device can also include an activation member having a projection\n     that is configured to engage with a surface of the drive shaft to move\n     between a first position when the attachment member is not coupled to the\n     drive shaft and a second position when the attachment member is coupled\n     to the drive shaft. The activation member can be positioned in contact\n     with the counter member so that movement from the first position to the\n     second position causes the counter member to advance the one increment.\n     The attachment member can include a cross bar, wherein the cross bar and\n     the counter member are configured to engage with one another to permit a\n     limited amount of relative movement between the cross bar and the counter\n     member. The limited amount of movement can comprise a predetermined\n     number of increments. The predetermined number of increments can be the\n     number of uses of the cutting tool within its effective functional life.\n[0011] In other embodiments, a method of restricting the number of uses of\n     a cutting tool is provided. The method can include coupling an attachment\n     member of a cutting tool to a receiving area of a powered driving member,\n     with the coupling of the attachment member to the receiving area\n     comprising rotating the cutting tool relative to the powered driving\n     member. The relative rotation of the cutting tool and powered driving\n     member can cause an activation member on the cutting tool to contact a\n     surface of the powered driving member, with the contact of the activation\n     member with the surface of the powered driving member causing the\n     activation member to move from a first position to a second position. A\n     counter on the cutting tool can be incremented by the movement of the\n     activation member from the first position to the second position. The\n     cutting tool can be removed from the receiving area of the powered\n     driving member. Further coupling of the attachment member to the\n     receiving area of the powered driving member can be restricted once a\n     predetermined number of incrementing steps have occurred.\n[0012] In some embodiments, the counter on the cutting tool comprises a\n     counter gear that rotates one increment each time the activation member\n     moves from the first position to the second position. The restricting\n     step can include restricting rotation of the counter gear once the\n     predetermined number of incrementing steps have occurred. The restricting\n     of the rotation of the counter gear can be achieved, in some embodiments,\n     by positioning a non-movable engagement member on the cutting tool, with\n     the non-moveable engagement member extending through at least a portion\n     of an opening in the counter gear. The non-moveable engagement member and\n     opening in the counter gear permit relative movement between the counter\n     gear and the non-moveable engagement member when the predetermined number\n     of incrementing steps have not occurred and restrict relative movement\n     between the counter gear and the non-moveable engagement member when the\n     predetermined number of incrementing steps have occurred. A length of the\n     opening in the counter gear can at least partly determine the\n     predetermined number of incrementing steps.\n[0013] In another embodiment, a method of determining an effective\n     functional life of a medical cutting tool for cutting through bone is\n     provided. The method includes (a) cutting through bone in a bone\n     preparation area using the cutting tool; (b) measuring a temperature of\n     the bone in the bone preparation area; (c) cutting through bone in a\n     different bone preparation area; and (d) measuring a temperature of the\n     bone in the different bone preparation area. Steps (a)-(d) can be\n     repeated until the temperature in a bone preparation area is measured to\n     exceed 50.degree. C. Then, the number of bone preparation areas that can\n     be prepared using the cutting tool until the temperature in a respective\n     bone preparation area exceeds 50.degree. C. can be calculated and the\n     effective functional life of the cutting tool as the number calculated\n     can be identified.\n[0014] The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the\n     invention will become more apparent from the following detailed\n     description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0015] FIG. 1 is illustrates an exemplary test set-up for calculating the\n     number of uses of a cutting tool before it reaches the end of its\n     effective functional life.\n[0016] FIG. 2 illustrates a chart of a functional evaluation of a medical\n     cutting tool.\n[0017] FIG. 3 illustrates another chart of a functional evaluation of a\n     medical cutting tool.\n[0018] FIG. 4A illustrates a drive shaft to which a cutting tool can be\n     coupled, and an end view of the same.\n[0019] FIG. 4B illustrates a cutting tool and a drive shaft to which the\n     cutting tool can be coupled.\n[0020] FIG. 4C illustrates a cutting tool that can be coupled to a drive\n     shaft.\n[0021] FIGS. 5A-5C illustrate a method of coupling a cutting tool to the\n     drive shaft of FIG. 4A.\n[0022] FIG. 6A illustrates an exploded view of a limited-use cutting tool.\n[0023] FIG. 6B illustrates a bottom view of the limited-use cutting tool.\n[0024] FIG. 6C illustrates a bottom view of a counter gear with a slot\n     formed for receiving a cross bar pin.\n[0025] FIG. 7A illustrates another exploded view of a limited-use cutting\n     tool, shown without the cutting reamer for clarity.\n[0026] FIG. 7B illustrates a bottom view of the limited-use cutting tool\n     shown in FIG. 7A.\n[0027] FIG. 7C illustrates a bottom view of the limited-use cutting tool\n     shown in FIG. 7A.\n[0028] FIGS. 8A-8C illustrate a method of using a limited-use cutting\n     tool.\n[0029] FIG. 9 illustrates a system with an indexing wheel for limiting the\n     number of uses of a cutting device.\n[0030] FIGS. 10A-10C illustrate a method of using a limited-use cutting\n     tool.\n[0031] FIGS. 11A-11B illustrate a method of using a limited-use cutting\n     tool.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n[0032] Various embodiments of methods and systems for providing improved\n     quality control relating to the use of various instruments and tools are\n     disclosed herein. The following description is exemplary in nature and is\n     not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the\n     invention in any way. Various changes to the described embodiments may be\n     made in the function and arrangement of the elements described herein\n     without departing from the scope of the invention.\n[0033] As used in this application and in the claims, the terms "a," "an,"\n     and "the" include both the singular and plural forms of the element(s)\n     they refer to unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n     Additionally, the term "includes" means "comprises." As used herein, the\n     term "effective functional life" means the amount of use a tool can\n     experience before it begins to operate suboptimally for its intended\n     purpose. In some embodiments, the effective functional life can be based\n     on a number of uses of the tool and/or an amount of time the tool has\n     been used.\n[0034] Although the operations of exemplary embodiments of the disclosed\n     method may be described in a particular, sequential order for convenient\n     presentation, it should be understood that disclosed embodiments can\n     encompass an order of operations other than the particular, sequential\n     order disclosed. For example, operations described sequentially may in\n     some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently. Further, descriptions\n     and disclosures provided in association with one particular embodiment\n     are not limited to that embodiment, and may be applied to any embodiment\n     disclosed.\n[0035] The technologies described herein can be used with a variety of\n     instruments and tools to ensure that the quality of those instruments and\n     tools are sufficient for the purpose to which they are intended to be\n     used. In some disclosed embodiments, the instruments and tools described\n     include medical cutting tools. As described herein, the adoption of these\n     technologies in connection with medical cutting tools can provide\n     significant improvements over conventional methods and systems for\n     assessing the quality and appropriateness of such instruments and tools\n     for use in surgical procedures.\n[0036] Conventional use of medical cutting tools generally involves one or\n     more of the following steps. The medical cutting tools are manufactured,\n     purchased, and then delivered to the hospital. Upon receipt by the\n     hospital, the cutting tools undergo specific sterilization processes to\n     sterilize the cutting tools before they are introduced into the operating\n     room environment for use on a patient. After use on a patient, the\n     cutting tools can be processed again through the same or similar\n     procedures for cleaning and sterilization. After sterilization, the\n     cutting tools can be used again on another patient. This process can be\n     repeated many times.\n[0037] Unfortunately, mere visual inspection of a cutting edge or surface\n     of a tool by the surgeon or other related personnel is not an effective\n     method of assessing the effectiveness of a cutting tool. As a result,\n     cutting tools are generally discarded only when the surgeon uses it in a\n     clinical case and recognizes that the tool is no longer functioning\n     properly. With regard to medical cutting tools, the failure to function\n     properly is generally recognized when the surgeon must apply excessive\n     loads to the tool to advance the cutter through the bone of the patient.\n     Such excessive loads generate additional heat at the cutting tool-bone\n     interface, which can result in undesirable bone necrosis.\n[0038] Once the surgeon recognizes that the tool is no longer functioning\n     properly, the tool is usually taken out of use. Unfortunately, by the\n     time the tool has been identified as no longer functioning properly, it\n     has already been used past its effective functional life. The recognition\n     of the non-functioning of the tool by the surgeon generally occurs when\n     the cutting tool experiences an extreme failure. At this point, however,\n     not only was the tool used past its effective functional life during the\n     surgery where the surgeon recognized the tool was not functioning\n     properly, the cutting tool likely performed inefficiently or suboptimally\n     for several surgeries prior to this event. As a result, conventional\n     methods of sterilization and reuse of cutting tools expose many patients\n     to negative effects, such as bone heat necrosis, from the use of\n     ineffective cutting tools. The exposure of patients to ineffective\n     cutting tools can negatively affect the success of the surgical\n     procedure, both by affecting the surgical process itself as well as the\n     patient\'s recovery from the surgery.\n[0039] Accordingly, conventional approaches to sterilization and reuse do\n     not provide sufficient protection to ensure that sub-optimal or otherwise\n     inadequate cutting tools are not reused by surgeons. The methods and\n     systems described herein significantly improve the quality control for\n     determining whether it is desirable to reuse a particular cutting tool\n     after one or more previous uses.\n[0040] Exemplary Negative Effects of Using Dull Cutting Tools\n[0041] Dull cutting tools can cause clinical issues for patients on which\n     these dull cutting tools are used. The following embodiments relate to\n     medical cutting tools; however, it should be understood that the systems\n     and methods described herein can be used with other cutting tools in\n     which it would be desirable to limit or otherwise restrict their use when\n     they become ineffective cutting tools.\n[0042] Medical cutting tools can be used to cut through bone, which can\n     include both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).\n     Such cutting tools can include, for example, various reamers configured\n     to cut and/or remove bone from a patient. Efficient cutting tools are\n     desirable to cut through bone, especially cortical bone which is\n     generally denser and stronger than cancellous bone, without creating\n     excessive heat. Excessive heat can cause thermal damage to soft tissue\n     and bone, including bone necrosis, with the amount of thermal damage\n     caused being related to the magnitude of the temperature elevation and\n     the period of time that the tissue is exposed to those temperatures.\n[0043] Necrosis of bone cells can occur when temperatures generated during\n     cutting actions are at or above 122.degree. F. (50.degree. C.). If the\n     cutting procedure is to be followed by implantation of a prosthetic\n     device into the bone preparation area, the occurrence of bone necrosis\n     can reduce the effectiveness of the device. Such prosthetic devices are\n     desirably supported by strong bone and the occurrence of bone necrosis in\n     the bone preparation area reduces the strength of the bone in that area.\n     This can result in a prosthetic device coming loose from the attachment\n     area when the dead bone is resorbed and replaced by new bone during the\n     healing process.\n[0044] High temperatures can also negatively affect bone-forming cells\n     (osteoblasts) in the attachment area. The attachment of uncemented\n     orthopaedic devices to bone occurs when new bone grows into or onto the\n     surface of the device. However, bone-forming cells can die when exposed\n     to temperatures over 50.degree. C. Thus, the death of such bone cells at\n     or near the surface of an attachment area can delay and interfere\n     altogether with the attachment process.\n[0045] Heat generated when cutting bone is primarily due to friction at\n     the cutting edge of the cutter (e.g., teeth) and the movement of bone\n     chips over the surface of the cutter. When a cutting tool is sharp, it\n     can complete the preparation of the bone in fewer revolutions. Since the\n     cutting edges move less distance over the bone, the temperature in the\n     bone preparation area remains lower. In addition, fewer revolutions means\n     that the bone is exposed to the elevated temperatures caused by the\n     cutting action for a shorter period of time. When the cutting edges are\n     dull, however, several issues occur which quickly result in the\n     generation of additional heat from friction. First, the dull condition of\n     cutting edges slows the advancement of the cutting tool and requires\n     greater loads placed on the bone by the cutting tool, both of which\n     contribute to elevating the temperature in the bone preparation area.\n     Second, the cutting tool takes longer to achieve the bone preparation\n     resulting in a greater number of revolutions of the cutting tool at\n     higher applied loads yielding higher temperatures. Because of the greater\n     loads and increased time associated with using dull cutting tools,\n     temperatures associated with their use in cutting bone can exceed the\n     threshold of 122.degree. F.\n[0046] A cutting tool (e.g., a reamer) that is always sharp is also safer,\n     as less pressure is required when cutting (e.g., reaming). Sharper\n     cutting tools also allow the surgeon to exercise better control and more\n     easily avoid both imprecise and over-cutting (e.g., over-reaming), which\n     can result in improper positioning when the device is implanted, as well\n     as removal of too much bone, compromising the stability of the device and\n     the strength of the remaining bone that supports it.\n[0047] Effective Functional Life of Instruments\n[0048] A particular cutting tool can be evaluated to determine the\n     effective functional life of that instrument. After determining the\n     effective functional life of a cutting tool, the systems and methods\n     described herein can restrict the use of that tool outside of the tool\'s\n     effective functional life. By using the systems and methods described\n     herein, a surgeon (or other operator) can be confident that the cutting\n     tool that is to be used for a cutting process is sufficiently sharp,\n     thereby reducing the occurrence of negative conditions associated with\n     the use of dull instruments, such as bone necrosis when cutting bone.\n[0049] In some embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein\n     provide a limited-use cutting tool to assure quality and function of the\n     tool during a cutting procedure. By using these systems and methods, a\n     simplified quality assurance procedure can be provided which does not\n     require the hospital (or other entity) to implement a more complicated\n     system for tracking and monitoring the condition of a particular cutting\n     tool.\n[0050] The systems and methods described herein provide various manners of\n     counting the number of uses of a cutting tool and disabling (or otherwise\n     restricting) the use of that tool once the prescribed number of uses has\n     been reached. In some embodiments, the maximum number of uses can be\n     predetermined by, for example, laboratory or field testing. In one\n     embodiment, the simulated clinical conditions can be worse-case scenario\n     conditions. Once the predetermined maximum number of uses has been\n     reached, the cutting tool can be rendered non-functional and can be\n     discarded or otherwise reconditioned.\nExample\nDetermination of Effective Functional Life of Cutting Tools\n[0051] The following example relates to a cutting tool that is an\n     acetabular spherical reamer. The cutting teeth of an acetabular spherical\n     reamer are preferably sharp in order to properly prepare the acetabular\n     bed without generating excessive heat. In many cases, a cutter can work\n     for multiple surgeries; however, the hardness of the bone encountered by\n     the cutter determines how long the cutter will function properly without\n     damaging the patient\'s bone through heat necrosis. As the cutter\n     encounters hard cortical bone, the cutting edges begin to dull (e.g.,\n     teeth cutting edge radii increase) until the cutter will no longer\n     efficiently cut the bone. As the cutting teeth begin to dull, additional\n     force is required to advance the cutter through the bone, thereby\n     generating additional heat which can cause bone necrosis.\n[0052] FIG. 1 illustrates a laboratory test set-up for determining the\n     effective functional life of a cutting tool. In these tests, acetabular\n     reamers were used to cut bone (i.e., cortical bovine bone) to determine\n     the number of uses the acetabular reamers can experience before the end\n     of their effective functional life. In one example, it was determined\n     that approximately six (6) uses of the reamer produces a complete\n     preparation without generating excessive heat (e.g., temperatures at or\n     above 122.degree. F. (50.degree. C.)).\n[0053] FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate the results of an acetabular reamer\n     evaluation in bovine bone. FIG. 2 illustrates a chart showing the\n     functional evaluation of a 50 mm acetabular reamer to cut bovine bone,\n     graphing the number of bone preparations (i.e., uses of the cutting tool)\n     and the temperature in the bone preparation area. FIG. 3 illustrates a\n     chart showing the functional evaluation of a 50 mm acetabular reamer to\n     cut bovine bone, graphing the number of bone preparations (i.e., uses of\n     the cutting tool) and the time required to achieve the bone preparation.\n     As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, continuing to use the cutter after the sixth\n     use consistently resulted in a longer preparation time and increased heat\n     generation. The sharpness of the teeth cutting edges are directly\n     proportional to the load required to advance the cutter, and therefore\n     the resulting friction/heat generated. As the cutting edge rounds (or\n     dulls), it becomes less effective in penetrating the surface of the bone\n     and requires additional load to attempt to advance it. This cutter wear\n     is generally consistent for all cutting tools.\n[0054] Exemplary Limited-Use Cutting Tools\n[0055] In one embodiment, to ensure that an acetabular reamer functions\n     properly during each use (e.g., without causing undue bone necrosis), a\n     limiting device can be provided to limit the number of uses of the\n     reamer. For example, in one embodiment, a limiting device can be provided\n     to limit the number of uses of the reamer to six, which is the number of\n     uses after which it has been determined that this acetabular reamer no\n     longer functions in an optimal manner. The number of uses can vary,\n     however, and can, in some embodiments, be as low as one. The number of\n     uses can be predetermined based on field and/or laboratory testing and\n     can be specific to the cutting device. For example, one acetabular reamer\n     can have an effective functional life that permits six uses of the device\n     to cut bone, while another different acetabular reamer may have an\n     effective life of eight or more.\n[0056] The limiting device can be incorporated into the acetabular reamer\n     to monitor the number of uses of the instrument by counting the number of\n     times the reamer was assembled to the reamer shaft. Once the prescribed\n     number of uses is reached, the limiting device can prevent the instrument\n     from being assembled to the reamer shaft for further use.\n[0057] FIGS. 4A-4C and 5A-5B illustrate a reamer shaft 10 and an\n     acetabular reamer 12 that are configured to be coupled together. As shown\n     in FIGS. 4A and 5A-5C, to attach the reamer 12 with the reamer shaft\n     coupling member 14 of the reamer shaft 10, a cross bar 16 of the reamer\n     12 is aligned with an opening 18 or other mating feature on the reamer\n     shaft coupling member 14. A collar 20 on the reamer shaft 10 can be\n     retracted (FIG. 5A) and the reamer 12 can be inserted into the opening 18\n     on the reamer shaft 10 (FIG. 5B). To lock the reamer in place, the reamer\n     12 can be rotated so that the cross bar 16 extends into a slotted portion\n     22 of the shaft coupling member 14 (e.g., clockwise in FIGS. 5B-5C). Then\n     the retracted collar 20 can be released, moving collar 20 towards the\n     reamer 10 to secure it in place on reamer shaft 12 (FIG. 5C).\n[0058] FIG. 6A illustrates an embodiment of a limited-use acetabular\n     reamer 112 that can be attached to a reamer shaft, such as that shown in\n     FIGS. 5A-5C. The limited-use reamer 112 comprises a limiting device that\n     restricts the number of uses of the reamer. In one embodiment, the\n     limiting device can function by preventing the attachment of the reamer\n     to a reamer shaft after a certain number of uses.\n[0059] The limiting device of the acetabular reamer can comprise a\n     counting mechanism, such as a counter gear 130 shown in FIG. 6A. As shown\n     in FIG. 6, counter gear 130 can be configured to engage with an actuator\n     or activation member 132 that is also coupled to the reamer 112. Actuator\n     132 can comprise any structure that is configured to engage with the\n     reamer shaft coupling member 114 and cause relative movement in the\n     counter mechanism (e.g., counter gear 130). For example, as shown in\n     FIGS. 6A-6C and 7A-7C, actuator 132 can comprise a pin 134 that extends\n     laterally from a side surface of its main body and a first gear surface\n     136 configured to mate with a second gear surface 138 of counter gear\n     132.\n[0060] When the reamer 112 is coupled to the reamer shaft, the actuator\n     pin 134 is configured to engage with a surface on the reamer shaft (e.g.,\n     reamer coupling surface 140). As the reamer 112 is rotated to lock the\n     reamer 132 onto the end of the reamer shaft, contact between the actuator\n     pin 134 and the surface 140 of the reamer shaft causes the actuator pin\n     134 to rotate, thereby causing the counter gear 130, which is engaged\n     with the actuator 132, to also rotate.\n[0061] To restrict use of the reamer 112 to a predetermined number of\n     uses, the counter gear 132 is restricted from rotating after that\n     predetermined number of uses has occurred. As shown in FIG. 6C, this can\n     be achieved by providing a slotted portion 142 on a bottom surface of the\n     counter gear 130 that mates with a respective pin member 144 on the\n     surface of the cross bar 116 of the reamer 112. As the counter gear 130\n     continues to rotate after each use, the pin 144 will move along the\n     slotted portion 142 of the counter gear 130. After a certain number of\n     rotations, however, the counter gear 130 will not be able to rotate any\n     further because the pin 144 will reach the end of the slotted portion\n     142.\n[0062] FIG. 7B and FIG. 7C show the interaction of the coupling member 114\n     with the reamer 112. As shown in FIG. 7C, reamer 112 can be rotated\n     clockwise (in the direction of arrow 150, while actuator pin 134 rests\n     against surface 140 of the coupling member 114. As reamer 112 rotates\n     clockwise, the contact of actuator pin 134 with surface 140 causes\n     actuator 132 to rotate relative to the actuator in the opposite direction\n     (in the relative direction of arrow 152) and engage the counter gear 130.\n     A torsion spring 146 can also be provided to cause the actuator 132 to\n     return to the starting position when the reamer 112 is removed from the\n     reamer shaft. In this manner, when reamer 112 is removed from the shaft,\n     actuator 132 returns to its starting position, but counter gear 130\n     maintains its position. That is, counter gear 130 moves in only one\n     direction as a result of contact with actuator 132. As counter gear 130\n     continues to rotate after each use, counter gear 130 will eventually\n     encounter the pin 144 on the cross bar 116. When the pin 144 reaches the\n     end of the slotted portion 142, activator 132 will not be able to rotate\n     any further and reamer 112 will no longer be capable of being assembled\n     on shaft coupling member 114.\n[0063] The number of times of use can be adjusted by changing the length\n     of travel for each use and/or changing the length of permissible travel\n     of the pin within the slotted portion (e.g., by lengthening or shortening\n     the slotted portion). In addition, the engaging surfaces of the counter\n     gear and cross bar can be roughened to increase the friction between\n     those two surfaces to achieve more effective contact between those two\n     surfaces. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 6A-6C, the actuator is\n     configured to rotate the counter gear about 36 degrees for each use;\n     however, other amounts of travel per use can be achieved using actuator\n     and counter gears as described herein.\n[0064] Although this embodiment provides a non-movable member on the cross\n     bar and a slotted member on the counter gear, it should be understood\n     that different configurations are possible, including, for example,\n     providing a rigid member on the counter gear that engages with a\n     non-movable slotted section or the like otherwise positioned on the\n     cutting tool and/or reamer shaft.\n[0065] In some embodiments, the number of uses can be varied based on the\n     size of the gearing and/or the length of the slotted portion. For\n     example, a longer slotted portion permits a greater number of uses, while\n     a shorter slotted portion allows fewer uses.\n[0066] When the reamer is removed from the reamer shaft, the actuator can\n     be configured to return to its original starting position. To facilitate\n     this movement of the actuator, a spring, such as a torsion spring, can be\n     positioned in contact with the actuator.\n[0067] Preferably, the limiting device is built-in to the cutting tool so\n     that the counting measures of the device cannot be easily circumvented.\n     For example, in the embodiment described in FIGS. 5 and 6, the limiting\n     device is coupled to the reamer itself so that the limiting device is a\n     part of the structure of the reamer.\n[0068] It should be understood that alternative limiting devices and\n     systems can be used to restrict the number of times that an instrument\n     can be attached to another tool. For example, FIGS. 8-11 illustrate two\n     other embodiments of instruments that comprise limiting devices that are\n     configured to prevent coupling of an instrument after a predetermined\n     number of uses.\n[0069] FIGS. 8A-8C illustrate an embodiment of an instrument that includes\n     a limiting device that has longitudinal counting mechanism, rather than a\n     rotational counting mechanism, that is configured to restrict the number\n     of times the instrument can be coupled to a tool. In the example shown in\n     FIGS. 8A-8C, the instrument can be a reamer shaft and an acetabular\n     reamer 212 similar to those shown in other embodiments.\n[0070] As shown in FIG. 8A, the limiting device can include a\n     longitudinally moveable element 260 (e.g., a plunger) that is configured\n     to engage with a surface of the tool to which the instrument is to be\n     attached (e.g., reamer shaft). Upon contact with the surface of the tool,\n     the longitudinally moveable element 260 can contact and move a\n     longitudinal counter that is moveable through a limited distance to\n     restrict the number of times the instrument has been attached to the\n     tool.\n[0071] As shown in FIGS. 8A-8C, the longitudinal counter can be a\n     longitudinally moveable counting rod 262 that can move a predetermined\n     distance within the instrument. Each time the longitudinally moveable\n     element 260 contacts the counting rod 262, the counting rod 262 moves a\n     predetermined distance until it reaches the end of the amount of travel\n     that is permitted by the instrument. For example, counting rod can be\n     configured so that it can move a predetermined distance within an opening\n     in an end cap 263. Once the counting rod has traveled the predetermined\n     distance, an end of the counting rod engages with the end cap. As a\n     result of the engagement of the counting rod with the end cap, when the\n     longitudinally moveable element 260 engages with a surface on the tool,\n     the counting rod cannot move any further within the opening in the end\n     cap and further assembly of the instrument to the tool is prevented.\n[0072] FIG. 8A illustrates movement of longitudinally moveable element 260\n     in the direction of arrow 264 upon engagement of the longitudinally\n     moveable element 260 with a reamer shaft. As shown in FIG. 8B, the reamer\n     is then rotated to lock it in place (as described in other embodiments)\n     and longitudinal counter 262 advances a prescribed distance. As shown in\n     FIG. 8C, upon removal of the reamer from the shaft, the longitudinally\n     moveable element 260 returns to the start position (moving in the\n     direction of arrow 266) so that the cycle can repeat. Once the\n     longitudinally moveable element 260 reaches the end of the cap (or some\n     other limiting structure), further assembly of the reamer to the shaft is\n     no longer possible.\n[0073] The number of uses of the instrument can be set by determining the\n     distance that the counting rod will travel during each engagement of the\n     longitudinally moveable element with the surface of the tool, and setting\n     the total distance that the counting rod can travel within the instrument\n     to be that distance times the number of uses of the instrument that are\n     permissible before the instrument exceeds its effective functional life.\n[0074] Another alternative embodiment of an instrument with a limiting\n     device is shown in FIG. 9. In this embodiment, a combination of\n     longitudinal movement and rotation movement can be used to count and\n     restrict the number of uses of the instrument. As shown in FIG. 9, a\n     longitudinally moveable member 360 (e.g., a plunger) is configured to\n     engage with a circular counter. The circular counter can comprise, for\n     example, an indexing wheel 363 that is rotatably attached to the\n     instrument. For each engagement of the instrument (e.g., an acetabular\n     reamer) with a tool (e.g., a reamer shaft), the indexing wheel 363 can\n     rotate by a predetermined amount. In some embodiments, the predetermined\n     amount of rotation for each use of the instrument (i.e., for each\n     engagement of the instrument to a tool) can be a single tooth of the\n     indexing wheel. In other embodiments, the predetermined amount of\n     rotation for each use of the instrument can be a rotation through a\n     plurality of teeth on the indexing wheel.\n[0075] After a predetermined number of uses have been achieved (e.g., the\n     number of uses that have been determined to be possible before exceeding\n     the effective functional life of the instrument), a pin or other\n     restricting member located on the instrument can be configured to contact\n     another structure to restrict further movement of the indexing wheel.\n     When the indexing wheel can no longer rotate, the instrument can no\n     longer be coupled with the tool because the plunger cannot be depressed.\n[0076] Thus, relative movement of the indexing wheel and plunger can be\n     restricted to prevent attachment of the instrument to a tool for further\n     use of the instrument. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 9, a pin 365 is\n     fixed to the instrument (e.g., reamer body) and a groove 367 in the\n     indexing wheel permits a predetermined amount of rotational movement of\n     the indexing wheel 363 relative to the pin 365. However, it should be\n     understood that the relative movement between the indexing wheel and the\n     instrument can be restricted in a variety of other ways.\n[0077] FIGS. 10A-10C illustrate the operation of the limiting use member\n     of this embodiment. FIG. 10A illustrates a force being applied by a shaft\n     in contact with the reamer 312 in the direction of arrow 369. As the\n     longitudinally moveable element 360 moves upward in response to the\n     force, it engages with and causes indexing wheel 363 to rotate a\n     predetermined amount. As shown in FIG. 10B, when reamer 312 is removed\n     from the shaft, longitudinally moveable element 360 moves downwards (in\n     the direction of arrow 371). As the longitudinally moveable element 360\n     moves downward it does not engage with indexing wheel 363. Then, FIG. 10C\n     illustrates the indexing wheel 363 in a position where the reamer 312 can\n     no longer be received on a shaft because pin 365 has reached the end of\n     its travel along groove 367.\n[0078] In some embodiments, an indicator can be provided to reflect the\n     number of remaining uses and/or to visually provide a user with an\n     indication that the current use of the reamer is its last use within its\n     effective functional life.\n[0079] FIGS. 11A and 11B illustrate an embodiment that provides a visual\n     indication that the reamer has reached a predetermined number of uses\n     that indicate it is at the end of its effective functional life. FIGS.\n     11A and 11B show an embodiment where the visual indicator (e.g., a red\n     O-ring) moves from a position inside the device to a position outside the\n     device where it is visible. In this embodiment, an O-ring 470 can be\n     provided inside the drive shaft 472 of a reamer. Once the device reaches\n     its last use and is removed from the reamer shaft, an inner spring 474\n     pushes the longitudinally moveable element 460 and the O-ring 470 out of\n     the end of the device providing a visual indication that the reamer\n     cannot be used again.\n[0080] It should be understood that the systems and methods described\n     herein can be applied to a variety of cutting tools with different\n     couplings. Thus, as discussed herein, different cutting tools can be\n     provided with limiting devices that can limit the use of the cutting tool\n     to a predetermined number of uses, based on a determined effective\n     functional life of that device for its intended function. By using the\n     systems and methods described herein, various cutting tools can be\n     provided with built-in limiting devices to provide quality control\n     procedures that are tied to the number of uses of the tools and not on\n     visual inspection or other efforts by surgeons or other related\n     personnel.\n[0081] Thus, the embodiments described herein advantageously register (by\n     counters or other similar mechanisms) the number of uses of an instrument\n     such as a cutting tool by tracking or monitoring the number of times the\n     instrument has been coupled to another member (e.g., a drive shaft).\n     Because an instrument may be sterilized many times before use, the\n     registering of "uses" instead of "sterilizations" can be advantageous.\n     For example, for any surgical procedure numerous sterilized instruments\n     may be packaged together for the surgeon, such as various size reamers in\n     a single sterilized tray. However, generally not all of these sterilized\n     instruments are assembled with a tool (e.g., a drive shaft) and used by\n     the surgeon. Thus, by registering the number of times of assembly, the\n     effective functional life of the instrument can be accurately tracked.\n[0082] In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of\n     the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the\n     illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and\n     should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention. Rather, the\n     scope of the invention is defined by the following claims. We therefore\n     claim as our invention all that comes within the scope and spirit of\n     these claims.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 'patent_description': u'CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application\n     No. 61/586,685, which was filed on Jan. 13, 2012, and is incorporated\n     herein by reference in its entirety.\n       FIELD\n[0002] This disclosure relates to a novel systems and method relating to\n     cutting tools.\nBACKGROUND\n[0003] Cutting tools, such as medical reamers used by surgeons, generally\n     have a cutting surface that is able to cut and/or remove material from an\n     object. For example, in many different disciplines in orthopedics cutting\n     tools are used for machining bone in the preparation of artificial joints\n     including hips, knees, elbows and shoulders, and also in the repair of\n     long bone fractures. The design and method of manufacturing cutting\n     surfaces of cutting tools can affect the efficiency, functional life of\n     the spherical reamer and cost in manufacturing. Accordingly, improvements\n     relating to design and manufacturing methods are desirable.\nSUMMARY\n[0004] In some embodiments, improved cutting tools and methods of\n     manufacturing the same are provided.\n[0005] In certain implementations, the cutting tools comprise medical\n     reamers, including acetabular reamers, long bone cylindrical reamers,\n     long bone tapered reamers, patella reamers and glenoid reamers along with\n     the design of different cutting teeth in specific zones of the reamers\n     and the improved method of making these reamers and their cutting edges.\n[0006] In some implementations, a cutting tool is provided with a cutting\n     surface on a first side of the cutting tool and an attachment member on a\n     second side of the cutting tool. The cutting surface can include a\n     plurality of cutting edges and the attachment member can be configured to\n     be coupled to a powered driving member (e.g., a drill). The cutting tool\n     comprises an axis of rotation and the cutting surface defines a plurality\n     of latitude lines. The plurality of cutting edges can be oriented at\n     varying orientation angles relative to the latitude lines.\n[0007] In some implementations, the plurality of cutting edges can be in\n     three different zones and respective cutting edges in the different zones\n     have different characteristics. The different zones can comprise a polar\n     zone, a transition zone, and an equatorial zone. Respective cutting edges\n     can define a cutting angle between the cutting edge and a first side of\n     the cutting tool, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the\n     polar zone can be larger than those defined by cutting edges in the\n     transition zone, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the\n     transition zone can be larger than those defined by cutting edges in the\n     equatorial zone. In some implementations, the tooth height can be the\n     same (i.e., substantially the same) regardless of the cutting angle.\n[0008] In some implementations, the orientation angles vary depending on\n     whether the respective cutting edges are in the polar zone, the\n     transition zone, or the equatorial zone, and the orientation angle of\n     respective cutting edges in the equatorial zone is greater than the\n     orientation angle of respective cutting edges in the transition zone, and\n     the orientation angle of respective cutting edges in the transition zone\n     is greater than the orientation angle of respective cutting edges in the\n     polar zone.\n[0009] In some implementations, the thickness of the side wall is less\n     than 0.040 inches, or in some cases, between 0.022 inches and 0.40\n     inches. Openings can be provided adjacent respective cutting edges, the\n     respective openings defining a funnel angle that is between 20 and 40\n     degrees. In some cases, the funnel angle can be between 25 and 35\n     degrees.\n[0010] In some implementations, the cutting surface is a panel and the\n     cutting tool comprises a plurality of separate panels. The cutting tool\n     can include a frame member (e.g., a center support and a base) and the\n     plurality of separate panels can be coupled to the frame member.\n[0011] In another implementation, a method for forming a cutting tool is\n     provided. The method can include forming a plurality of panels from one\n     or more flat sheets of metal and coupling the plurality of panels to a\n     frame member to form the cutting tool. The plurality of panels can be\n     formed with a plurality of cutting edges and a plurality of openings\n     adjacent respective cutting edges. When coupled to the frame member, the\n     plurality of panels can define a plurality of latitude lines about the\n     axis of rotation of the cutting tool and the plurality of formed cutting\n     edges have orientation angles relative to the latitude lines that vary.\n     In some cases, respective panels can have cutting edges with orientation\n     angles that vary along the respective panel.\n[0012] In certain implementations, the act of forming a plurality of\n     panels comprises stamping the one or more flat sheets of metal to form a\n     plurality of cavities and punching holes at or adjacent to the plurality\n     of cavity to provide bone-chip-receiving openings. The act of forming the\n     plurality of cavities can include forming a plurality of "V"-shaped\n     cavities.\n[0013] In certain implementations, the act of forming the plurality of\n     panels can include stamping the one or more panels to create a desired\n     height of the cutting edges and to provide a desired curvature of the one\n     or more panels.\n[0014] In certain implementations, the act of coupling the plurality of\n     panels to the frame member can include forming a frame member that\n     comprises a center support, a base, and a form dome, and securing the\n     plurality of panels to the center support, the base, and the form dome.\n     In some cases, the act of securing the plurality of panels to the center\n     support, the base, and the form dome can be performed by laser welding or\n     other types of welding. The act of coupling the plurality of panels to\n     the frame member can also include placing the plurality of panels into an\n     injection molding tool and injection molding the frame member around the\n     plurality of panels to create the frame member.\n[0015] In some implementations, the act of forming a plurality of panels\n     from one or more flat sheets of metal can include forming the plurality\n     of cutting edges with different zones that have cutting edges with\n     different characteristics, the different zones comprising a polar zone, a\n     transition zone, and an equatorial zone. Respective cutting edges can\n     define a cutting angle between the cutting edge and a first side of the\n     cutting tool, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the polar\n     zone are larger than those defined by cutting edges in the transition\n     zone, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the transition zone\n     are larger than those defined by cutting edges in the equatorial zone.\n[0016] In certain implementations, the act of punching holes at or\n     adjacent to the plurality of cavity comprises forming bone-chip-receiving\n     openings with a funnel angle that is between 20 and 40 degrees. In\n     addition, in some cases, the one or more flat sheets of metal have a\n     thickness less than 0.040 inches.\n[0017] In certain implementations, the method includes determining an\n     effective functional life of the cutting tool.\n[0018] In other embodiments, a cutting tool is provide that has a cutting\n     surface on a first side of the cutting tool, the cutting surface\n     comprising a plurality of cutting edges, and an attachment member on a\n     second side of the cutting tool, the attachment member being configured\n     to be coupled to a powered driving member. A plurality of cutting edges\n     are provided in at least three different zones and respective cutting\n     edges in the different zones have different characteristics.\n[0019] The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the\n     invention will become more apparent from the following detailed\n     description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0020] FIG. 1 illustrates an acetabular reamer, the use of the reamer to\n     prepare the acetabulum, and a press-fit acetabular implant positioned as\n     part of a total hip procedure.\n[0021] FIG. 2 illustrates axial force applied by a surgeon, by pushing the\n     cutter into the acetabulum and a second torsional force exerted by the\n     power reaming tool.\n[0022] FIG. 3 illustrates a cutting tool composed of a sharp tooth edge, a\n     specific tooth elevation, specific cutting angle, a specific tooth\n     orientation to the axis of rotation and a peripheral opening around the\n     cutting edge providing an improved flow path for the bone debris.\n[0023] FIG. 4 illustrates another way of manufacture of cutting teeth\n     geometry.\n[0024] FIG. 5 illustrates a novel cutting tool having a plurality of\n     teeth.\n[0025] FIG. 6 illustrates a novel cutting tool having a plurality of\n     teeth.\n[0026] FIG. 7 illustrates a schematic view of cutting teeth zones and\n     their general functions.\n[0027] FIG. 8 illustrates a schematic view of cutting teeth zones and\n     their general functions.\n[0028] FIG. 9 illustrates a schematic view of cutting forces applied by a\n     cutting tool.\n[0029] FIG. 10 illustrates a comparison of the frictional forces\n     associated with bone chips created by cutting tools having different\n     thicknesses.\n[0030] FIG. 11 illustrates exemplary operations for forming panels with\n     multiple teeth designs and assembling such panels into a reamer.\n[0031] FIG. 12 illustrates a spherical reamer formed from panels coupled\n     to a plastic molded part.\n[0032] FIG. 13 illustrates a cylindrical reamer formed from panels coupled\n     to a plastic molded part.\n[0033] FIG. 14 illustrates the results of an exemplary test procedure.\n[0034] FIG. 15 illustrates exemplary cutting tools of at least some of the\n     disclosed embodiments, including a spherical reamer, long bone tapered\n     reamer, cylindrical reamer, and patellar reamer.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n[0035] The following description is exemplary in nature and is not\n     intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the\n     invention in any way. Various changes to the described embodiments may be\n     made in the function and arrangement of the elements described herein\n     without departing from the scope of the invention.\n[0036] As used in this application and in the claims, the terms "a," "an,"\n     and "the" include both the singular and plural forms of the element(s)\n     they refer to unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n     Additionally, the term "includes" means "comprises." Further, the term\n     "coupled" generally means electrically, electromagnetically, and/or\n     physically (e.g., mechanically or chemically) coupled or linked and does\n     not exclude the presence of intermediate elements between the coupled or\n     associated items absent specific contrary language.\n[0037] As used herein, the term "effective functional life" means the\n     amount of use a tool can experience before it begins to operate\n     suboptimally for its intended purpose. In some embodiments, the effective\n     functional life can be based on a number of uses of the tool and/or an\n     amount of time the tool has been used. As used herein, the term\n     "single-use" tool or instrument means a tool or instrument that is\n     configured and/or intended to be used once before being discarded. Thus,\n     a single-use tool or instrument is a non-reuseable device in contrast to\n     reusable tools or instruments which, subject to certain procedures such\n     as cleaning and sterilization, may be used more than once. As used\n     herein, the term "powered driving member" means any device capable of\n     driving a cutting tool such as, for example, a drill.\n[0038] Although the operations of exemplary embodiments of the disclosed\n     method may be described in a particular, sequential order for convenient\n     presentation, it should be understood that disclosed embodiments can\n     encompass an order of operations other than the particular, sequential\n     order disclosed. For example, operations described sequentially may in\n     some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently. Further, descriptions\n     and disclosures provided in association with one particular embodiment\n     are not limited to that embodiment, and may be applied to any embodiment\n     disclosed.\n[0039] It is generally desirable that cutting surfaces on a cutting tool\n     (e.g., cutting teeth) be as accurate and consistent as possible for the\n     dimensional accuracy of the final preparation in the bone. For example,\n     cementless acetabular implants (press fit) are dependent on their\n     dimension and the dimension of the bone preparation to create a\n     reproducible interference fit for establishing initial stability of the\n     implant. FIG. 1 illustrates an acetabular reamer, the use of the reamer\n     to prepare the acetabulum, and a press-fit acetabular implant positioned\n     as part of a total hip procedure.\n[0040] The initial stability of the implant is critical to long term\n     success and if the implant moves large amounts (e.g., 75 microns or more)\n     under physiological loads post-operatively, it can result in soft tissue\n     growing into the implant rather than bone. If this occurs, the implant\n     will eventually loosen. Accordingly, the accuracy of the initial fit must\n     provide stability of the implant to allow bone to grow into the implant\n     during the first 6-12 weeks after surgery. In some instances, the\n     interference level required for cementless acetabular implants can be\n     required to be very small (e.g., less than 2 mm, and, in some cases,\n     preferably less than 1 mm). However, commercial cutters can vary in their\n     accuracy by as much as 0.25 mm and these variations can result in initial\n     acetabular implant stability. Because the initial interference fit\n     provides stability to the implant, improved accuracy of the teeth height\n     and performance can assist in achieving this goal.\n[0041] Configuration of Cutting Members\n[0042] Conventional reamer designs use the same cutting tooth geometry\n     within each design. These teeth are also positioned at 90.degree. to the\n     latitude lines of the spherical reamer surface. However, cutting teeth\n     around the equator of the reamer perform a side cutting function while\n     teeth towards the dome of the cutter perform an end cutting function.\n[0043] As described in more detail herein, various embodiments are\n     provided in which reamers utilize different cutting teeth configurations\n     and different orientations to address the different bone cutting\n     requirements and thereby improving the efficiency of the cut. By\n     efficiently designing cutting teeth for specific operations, faster bone\n     cuts can be achieved, thereby producing less friction. Minimizing the\n     friction generated by the reamers relates directly to maintaining the\n     life of the bone. Friction can lead to heat and if the cutter-bone\n     interface reaches temperatures above 50.degree. C. (122.degree. F.) bone\n     death (necrosis) can occur. This can affect long term success of the\n     procedure whether the implant is used with or without bone cement. If the\n     bone preparation bed is damaged due to excessive heat generated from the\n     acetabular cutter, the fixation of the implant will be compromised and\n     can lead to loosening and revision.\n[0044] There are two primary forces applied to the reamer during the\n     machining of the bone. When considering an acetabular reamer, as shown in\n     FIG. 2, there is an axial force applied by the surgeon who pushes the\n     cutter into the acetabulum and a second torsional force exerted by the\n     power reaming tool. In some embodiments, the novel cutting tools\n     disclosed herein convert the torsional force into a force applied at the\n     cutting tooth edge to improve the efficiency of the cut.\n[0045] The systems and methods described herein for forming cutting tools\n     can provide greater control and accuracy of the tooth sharpness, cutting\n     angles, and resulting bone chip removal by the tool. In addition, as\n     described in more detail below, the cutting tools described herein can be\n     formed by novel manufacturing processes that permit the creation of\n     multiple teeth in one operation.\n[0046] In the embodiments described herein, cutting surfaces (e.g., teeth)\n     can comprise a sharp tooth edge (tolerance 0.0005\'\' to 0.002\'\' tooth edge\n     radius), a specific tooth elevation (tolerance 0.002\'\'-0.004\'\'), specific\n     cutting angle, a specific tooth orientation to the axis of rotation\n     (e.g., tool angle), and a peripheral opening around the cutting edge\n     providing a designed flow path for the bone debris as shown in FIG. 3.\n     This tooth geometry can also be manufactured according to FIG. 4 through\n     a series of stamping operations allowing for multiple teeth to be made at\n     the same time. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 4, a flat sheet of\n     material (e.g., metal) can be stamped so that a plurality of "V"-type\n     cavities are punched into the sheet based on a desired cutting angle\n     .omega.. Next, a plurality of holes can be punched around the "V"-type\n     cavities (or grooves), creating a cutting edge. If necessary, another\n     stamping step can be performed to stamp the tooth height and curvature in\n     operation (or multiple operations if desired). As shown in FIG. 4, angle\n     .beta. determines the tooth height and angle .beta. in conjunction with\n     angle .alpha. will determine the rake angle .omega.\n     (.omega.=.alpha.-.beta.) of the cutting surface. In some embodiments, the\n     rake angle can vary between about 5 and 25 degrees, and in other\n     embodiments between about 5 and 15 degrees (e.g., about 10 degrees)\n[0047] Thus, in contrast to conventional devices, the tooth angle\n     (.alpha.) can be established in the first forming operation and can be\n     set (.omega. and .beta. angles) based on the intended function. Multiple\n     iterations of this tooth design can be provided in specific zones of the\n     reamer surface which address the intended type of cutting required at\n     those locations.\n[0048] In some embodiments, the novel cutting tools disclosed herein can\n     have teeth arranged in a spiral or helix manner on the surface of the\n     cutter. However, the tooth designs and tooth orientations can be\n     optimized to reduce the reaming time required to complete the\n     preparation. As shown in FIGS. 5-8, the cutting edges of the teeth can be\n     oriented at different angles to the lines of latitude based on the\n     required cutting functions at various positions on the surface of the\n     reamer. This can provide for a faster cut by converting the rotational\n     energy into linear energy assisting in advancing the reamer into the\n     preparation analogous to a screw thread (FIG. 5). The tooth orientation\n     can further improve the cutting force at the tooth edge. By changing the\n     orientation of the cutting edge relative to the latitude lines, a portion\n     of the torsional force is converted into a cutting force at the tooth\n     edge as shown in FIG. 6. This improvement primarily benefits the teeth\n     closest to the equator as they are performing a side cutting function.\n[0049] As shown in FIGS. 5-6, the angle of orientation of the cutting edge\n     relative to axis of rotation can increase from the equatorial teeth to\n     the polar teeth and decrease relative to the latitude lines. At least\n     three different types of cutting teeth (e.g., orientation angles and/or\n     cutting angles varying) can be provided on the tool. In some embodiments,\n     at least three regions are provided with similar type teeth in each\n     region. In other embodiments, the teeth can vary in a transitional manner\n     effectively providing more than three zones.\n[0050] In some embodiments, relative to the latitude lines, the range of\n     variation can be orientation angles of between 10 and 30 degrees (more\n     preferably between 15 and 25 degrees-e.g., 20 degrees) for the equatorial\n     zone, orientation angles of less than 5 degrees (more preferably about 0\n     degrees) in the polar zone, and somewhere in between for the orientation\n     angles in the transition zone (e.g., between 0 and 20 degrees, or\n     preferably between 5 and 15 degrees-e.g., 10 degrees). A benefit of the\n     larger orientation angles in the equatorial zone is a portion of the\n     axial load applied by the operator will be converted into driving the\n     cutting edge into the bone. As you move to the polar zone, the angle of\n     the tooth on the surface has less effect as the tooth becomes\n     perpendicular to the direction of the cut. That is, the specific tooth\n     geometry in the polar zone needs to address an end cutting ability rather\n     than a side cutting ability.\n[0051] FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary process by which a cutting tool\n     (e.g., a spherical reamer) transitions from engagement with the bone at\n     one area to another area of the cutting tool. As used herein, the term\n     "polar teeth" refer to cutting surfaces at and/or adjacent the pole of\n     the spherical reamer, the term "equatorial teeth" refer to cutting\n     surfaces at and/or adjacent to the equator of reamers having a\n     hemispherical shape (e.g., the area furthest from the poles in FIG. 7),\n     and the term "transition teeth" refer to cutting surfaces between the\n     polar and equatorial teeth.\n[0052] In the exemplary reaming process illustrated in FIG. 7, the\n     spherical reamer begins by introduction into the concave surface of the\n     acetabulum. It is noted that this initiation of the cut involves just the\n     equatorial teeth. These equatorial teeth are performing more of a side\n     cutting function and therefore can have a specific tooth angle based on\n     this intended function. Additional teeth (i.e., the transitional teeth)\n     become engaged with the bone as the reamer is further introduced into the\n     acetabulum. The transitional teeth perform a combination of side-cutting\n     and end-cutting and can be optimized for this purpose. As the reamer\n     becomes fully inserted into the preparation site, the teeth at the pole\n     (i.e., the polar teeth) of the reamer serve to primarily end-cut.\n[0053] Thus, the teeth can have different cutting demands depending on\n     their location on the surface of the reamer and can be configured\n     accordingly. FIG. 8 illustrates the manner in which the cutting angles of\n     the teeth can vary in accordance with the required cutting function of\n     the bone. The table below illustrates the types of teeth and their\n     configurations as reflected in FIG. 8.\n    TABLE-US-00001\n     Cutting angle (defined\n     relative to a side surface Tooth edge\n    Teeth Region of the cutting tool) radius Funnel angle Tooth height\n    Equatorial 15-35 degrees 0.0005-0.002\'\' 20-40 degrees, 0.020 .+-. 0.002\'\'\n     (more preferably,  (more preferably,\n     20-30 degrees)  25-35 degrees)\n    Transition 35-55 degrees 0.0005-0.002\'\' 20-40 degrees, 0.020 .+-. 0.002\'\'\n     (more preferably,  (more preferably,\n     40-50 degrees)  25-35 degrees)\n    Polar 55-75 degrees 0.0005-0.002\'\' 20-40 degrees, 0.020 .+-. 0.002\'\'\n     (more preferably,  (more preferably,\n     60-70 degrees)  25-35 degrees)\n[0054] Although, FIG. 8 illustrates these three zones as distinct zones,\n     it should be understood that the cutting surfaces can transition\n     gradually from one zone to another. Thus, polar teeth can transition\n     gradually from polar teeth with the orientation and characteristics noted\n     above to transition teeth with the orientation and characteristics noted\n     above. In this manner, for example, some teeth can have orientation and\n     characteristics of polar teeth (e.g., 65 degree cutting angle), some can\n     have characteristics of transition teeth (e.g., 45 degree cutting angle),\n     and some teeth between the polar teeth and transition teeth can have\n     characteristics somewhere inbetween (e.g., 55 degree cutting angle).\n[0055] Proper bone chip exit paths can also contribute to an improved\n     surgical preparation. With a non-impeded path for the bone chips to\n     travel away from the cutter, it enables the instrument to produce a\n     faster and cooler bone cut. As shown in FIG. 3, openings can be provided\n     adjacent cutting surfaces to provide a "funnel" that permits bone chips\n     to efficiently flow from the face of the reamer to avoid additional\n     torque requirements to drive the cutter. Without such openings, increased\n     torque is required to drive the cutting tool and such increased torque is\n     usually accompanied by increased axial pressure as the operator senses\n     the resistance in advancing the cutter and applies increased loads. This\n     combination generates increased heat through friction capable of\n     generating temperatures which can cause bone necrosis.\n[0056] Manufacturing of Cutting Tools\n[0057] In some embodiments, the novel cutting tools can be manufactured by\n     forming the spherical body and teeth from thinner sheet metal,\n     0.005\'\'-0.020\'\', which can improve the efficiency in manufacturing\n     (longer tool life of the forming tools) and ability to create a sharp\n     tooth edge without a specific sharpening operation. In addition the\n     thinner material better dissipates the heat generated from the friction\n     of cutting the bone over a thicker walled, heavier mass reamer. The\n     thinner material also produces less friction, therefore a lower\n     temperature at the surface, through reduction of the Coriolis forces\n     (FIG. 9).\n[0058] FIG. 10 illustrates a comparison of the frictional forces\n     associated with bone chips created by cutting tools having different\n     thicknesses. As shown in FIG. 10, for thicker walled cutters (e.g.,\n     cutters with wall thicknesses greater than 0.22\'\'), the bone chip\n     particles must travel a greater distance in contact with the cutting\n     surface of the cutter. As a result, lower temperatures can be achieved by\n     producing cutters with wall thickness of between 0.005\'\' and 0.020\'\'. The\n     following novel manufacturing methods can be used to produce cutting\n     tools with such reduced wall thicknesses.\n[0059] FIG. 11 illustrates exemplary operations for manufacturing cutting\n     tools. As shown in FIG. 11, panels can be formed with multiple teeth\n     designs and a reamer can be assembled as shown. This design and method of\n     manufacturing a spherical reamer can be faster and more efficient than\n     conventional techniques. In some embodiments, this method can be produced\n     in fewer steps, such as in nine operations. In comparison, some\n     conventional approaches of manufacturing of cutting tools can require\n     hundreds of operations to form a spherical reamer.\n[0060] As shown in FIG. 11, stamped cutting panels can be formed by\n     punching cavities in a flat sheet, forming holes for receiving bone\n     chips, and setting panel curvature and teeth height. A center support,\n     base, and dome can be formed and assembled with the panels to form a\n     single cutting tool. Thus, for example, in some embodiments, the\n     following steps can be taken:   [0061] 1. The specific tooth cutting\n     angle is punched into a flat metal blank with accuracy of\n     0.001.+-.0.0005\'\' as the first step. Angle can be set based on intended\n     cutting requirements of the bone. [0062] 2. Punch opening for bone chips\n     around tooth and create cutting edge. [0063] 3. Form spherical section\n     from the flat metal blank and elevate all teeth above spherical surface\n     with tooth elevation tolerance of +0.002\'\'. Teeth are formed as contours\n     of the intended spherical surfaces as opposed to just straight edges. The\n     opening around the teeth can be further formed into funnels at specific\n     angles to direct the bone chips away from the outer surface and into the\n     hollow cavity of the cutter. [0064] 4. Multiple panels are formed (3 to 8\n     for example) which are assembled and laser welded together forming a\n     spherical reamer.\n[0065] Using the manufacturing techniques described herein, any number of\n     teeth (e.g., 1-20 or more) can be made in a single forming step. In\n     contrast, conventional systems require multiple forming steps for each\n     individual tooth. Because the number of operations required to\n     manufacture a spherical reamer can be greatly reduced, the costs are\n     similarly reduced, thereby providing a lower cost, yet equally effective,\n     cutting tool that can be removed from clinical service at a the end of\n     its functional life without significant financial loss.\n[0066] It should be understood that the supporting structure for the\n     panels can be formed in various manners. For example, FIG. 12 illustrates\n     an alternative approach in which the panels are secured by a plastic\n     molded part.\n[0067] In some embodiments, the panels are placed directly into an\n     injection molding tool and a medical grade plastic (e.g., PEI\n     (polyetherimide, ULTEM.RTM.), PEEK (polyetheretherketone), PAI\n     (polyamidide, TORLON.RTM.) can be injected around the periphery of the\n     panels creating a frame that encloses and secures the panels. FIG. 13\n     illustrates a similar structure to that illustrated in FIG. 12; however,\n     instead of a spherical reamer, FIG. 13 depicts a cylindrical reamer.\n[0068] The cutting tools can be color coded to facilitate identification\n     of the various sizes and types of cutting tools. When the cutting tool\n     frames are formed by injection molding, such color coding can be achieved\n     by varying the color of the injection molded plastic part.\n[0069] Laboratory testing of a disclosed embodiment provided a comparison\n     to existing art spherical reamers. Bovine bone specimens were used to\n     monitor the speed to prepare a standard preparation, the temperature\n     generated during that preparation and how many preparations could be\n     completed before cutting edge damage generated a temperature exposure to\n     the bone above 50.degree. C. (122.degree. F.). FIG. 12 summarizes the\n     results of this testing and illustrates some of the improvements, such as\n     the ability to cut bone at a lower temperature for a greater number of\n     uses.\n[0070] All cutting tools will eventually wear at the cutting edges\n     resulting in a non-efficient cutter which would need to be sharpened or\n     discarded. This is true of all industries including the medical field\n     where these cutters are machining bone. In this field, the consequences\n     of the cutter becoming dull and continuing to use it can result in bone\n     necrosis. This in turn can jeopardize the success of the surgical\n     procedure as the prosthesis must be supported by live, healthy bone to\n     stabilize the implant. Excessive heat will kill the bone leading to bone\n     resorption and a less than ideal interference fit between the bone and\n     the implant. The rounding of the teeth cutting edges and damage to these\n     edges can be demonstrated after 4-6 uses of these reamers in cow bone. It\n     is for that reason all cutters should be qualified through laboratory\n     testing to define the maximum number of uses under worst-case conditions\n     which will not violate the temperature threshold for killing bone. This\n     test result can then be used as a method to identify when the cutter\n     should be removed from use.\n[0071] FIG. 14 illustrates a laboratory test set-up for determining the\n     effective functional life of a cutting tool. In these tests, acetabular\n     reamers were used to cut bone (i.e., cortical bovine bone) to determine\n     the number of uses the acetabular reamers can experience before the end\n     of their effective functional life. In one example, it was determined\n     that approximately six (6) uses of the reamer produces a complete\n     preparation without generating excessive heat (e.g., temperatures at or\n     above 122.degree. F. (50.degree. C.)).\n[0072] FIG. 14 also illustrates the results of an acetabular reamer\n     evaluation in bovine bone, including (1) a chart showing the functional\n     evaluation of a 50 mm acetabular reamer to cut bovine bone, graphing the\n     number of bone preparations (i.e., uses of the cutting tool) and the\n     temperature in the bone preparation area; and (2) a chart showing the\n     functional evaluation of a 50 mm acetabular reamer to cut bovine bone,\n     graphing the number of bone preparations (i.e., uses of the cutting tool)\n     and the time required to achieve the bone preparation. As shown in FIG.\n     14, continuing to use the cutter after the sixth use consistently\n     resulted in a longer preparation time and increased heat generation. The\n     sharpness of the teeth cutting edges are directly proportional to the\n     load required to advance the cutter, and therefore the resulting\n     friction/heat generated. As the cutting edge rounds (or dulls), it\n     becomes less effective in penetrating the surface of the bone and\n     requires additional load to attempt to advance it. This cutter wear is\n     generally consistent for all cutting tools.\n[0073] FIG. 15 illustrates exemplary cutting tools of at least some of the\n     disclosed embodiments, including a spherical reamer, long bone tapered\n     reamer, cylindrical reamer, and patellar reamer. The cutting tools and\n     methods of manufacturing the same can provide a number of improvements,\n     including (in certain embodiments) at least some of the following\n     improvements:   [0074] 1. Multiple teeth designs and teeth orientations\n     to address multiple machining needs of the bone yielding a faster, cooler\n     cut. [0075] 2. Tooth design geometries which address side cutting, end\n     cutting and a combination of both. [0076] 3. A thinner material for\n     forming the spherical reamer which can improve sharpness and reduction of\n     heat. [0077] 4. A thinner material which also provides for more efficient\n     forming of teeth and component parts improving manufacturing tool life.\n     [0078] 5. Ability to produce multiple teeth designs and multiple teeth in\n     fewer manufacturing steps. [0079] 6. A method of assembling a spherical\n     reamer using multiple panels, pre-stamped with teeth of specific geometry\n     and orientation.\n[0080] The novel approach to producing more efficient medical reamers\n     described herein can help ensure a proper bone preparation for every\n     patient. In addition, the cutting tools described herein can provide\n     improved sharpness, reduced heat during the reaming and a faster\n     preparation based on tooth geometry and orientation. These improvements\n     are also possible through a less expensive manufacturing process which\n     makes it more economical to discard the reamer when it becomes dull.\n[0081] Functional Life of Cutting Tools\n[0082] It is also desirable to understand the effective functional life of\n     the cutting tools described herein. As with any cutting tool, no matter\n     how efficient the cutter has been designed, it will dull after multiple\n     uses and its effective life will have terminated. Currently medical\n     spherical reamers are used multiple times without any monitoring of the\n     status of where the cutter is in its life cycle. Hospitals receive a new\n     spherical reamer and follow an instrument processing procedure that\n     includes cleaning, sterilizing, use, cleaning, sterilizing, and reuse.\n     However, that cycle can continue for many, many surgical procedures\n     before a surgeon notices the reamer is not cutting well.\n[0083] Cutting teeth dull after even a few uses and dull cutting teeth\n     generating heat that can be sufficient to cause bone necrosis.\n     Accordingly, in addition to improving teeth design, it can also be\n     helpful to provide the ability to indicate when a cutter should be\n     removed from use to avoid issues relating to bone necrosis from dull\n     cutters. In conventional approaches, instruments are used in hospitals on\n     patients many times without knowledge of the life expectancy of the\n     reamer and often beyond the functional life of the instrument. Some of\n     the reluctance to discard the instrument after a single use is the cost\n     of manufacturing these instruments. It is also perceived by the medical\n     industry through orthopedic surgeons that these instruments do have a\n     functional life greater than a single use. Accordingly, significant\n     improvements in manufacturing costs, such as those realized by the\n     embodiments described herein, can help to reduce the number of uses\n     needed to obtain a return on investment.\n[0084] As described above, the methods described herein can create more\n     cost effective cutting tools, such as spherical reamers. In addition, the\n     methods described herein can provide a means for defining the effective\n     functional life of the cutting tools and providing a method of knowing\n     when to discard it to ensure that the cutting tool used for any procedure\n     (e.g., a total hip procedure) will be effective for its intended purpose.\n[0085] In at least some of the embodiments described herein, as described\n     above, novel medical reamers can include at least some of the following\n     design parameters, enabling the production of more efficient tools for\n     cutting bone:\n[0086] 1. Optimize forces applied to the reamer.\n[0087] 2. Thin, sharp tooth edge.\n[0088] 3. Specific tooth designs and tooth orientations providing a faster\n     completion of the reaming cycle.\n[0089] 4. Adequate bone chip exit path to minimize friction from the flow\n     of the chips at the cutter surface.\n[0090] 5. Minimize friction from cutting by using thinner materials and\n     improved tooth geometry.\n[0091] 6. Define the functional life of the cutting edges through\n     laboratory testing to know when to discard the reamer.\n[0092] 7. Provide an improved and efficient manufacturing process.\n[0093] Laboratory testing to confirm an improved speed of the preparation,\n     a lower cutting exposure temperature to the bone and an increased\n     functional life to the reamer.\n[0094] It should also be understood that these design principles can be\n     incorporated into other cutting tools than those described in the\n     figures, such as medical reamers that are used for patella resurfacing,\n     glenoid reaming and machining the canal of long bones.\n[0095] In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of\n     the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the\n     illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and\n     should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

No.\n     12/0,722,671, filed on Feb. 27, 2008 for "Modular Spherical Hollow Reamer\n     Assembly For Medical Applications " which is a Continuation-In-Part of\n     application Ser. No. 11/973,260, filed Oct. 5, 2007 for "Modular Tapered\n     Hollow Reamer For Medical Applications" `which, in turn, is a\n     Continuation-in-Part of application Ser. No. 11/704,754, filed Feb. 9,\n     2007, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety\n     by reference thereto.\n       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n[0002] 1. Field of the Invention\n[0003] The present invention relates to a disposable reamer shaft that may\n     be attached to a modular disposable spherical or tapered hollow reamer,\n     the disposable reamer shaft being concentrically attached to a modular\n     hollow reamer to provide wobble free rotation of the reamer tool.\n[0004] 2. Description of the Prior Art\n[0005] Reaming of the internal canal of bones is required in many surgical\n     procedures of orthopedic surgery. These procedures include hip\n     replacement and shoulder replacement, and the like. Reamers are used in\n     procedures that involve creation of acetabular bone cavities that accept\n     a properly sized acetabular cups. Prior art reamers typically fall into\n     two major classes: rigid and flexible shaft. Typically, reaming of the\n     internal bone cavity is achieved through utilization of a solid spherical\n     reamer some having provisions for discharging and collecting reamed bone\n     fragments. Solid spherical reamers currently utilized are required to cut\n     both cancellous bone (spongy bone) and cortical bone (hard bone).\n     Cortical bone is generally denser and stronger, requiring an efficient\n     cutter to machine the acetabular cavity for a proper fit of the\n     acetabular cup. Conventional spherical reamers can cut cortical bone\n     initially but can quickly dull after a single use, or at best a few uses.\n     Once the reamer has dull cutting edges, it reduces the efficiency of bone\n     cutting and in addition generates sufficient friction/heat to damage or\n     kill the surrounding bone. These prior art solid spherical reamers are\n     intended for multiple uses and therefore become less efficient after each\n     surgery, resulting in poor cutting performance and bone necrosis. Dull\n     blades also incorporate bone debris or bone cement debris into the living\n     bone tissue, creating bone healing problems and fixation of an implanted\n     acetabular cup.\n[0006] U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,811,632, 5,100,267 and 5,299,893 to Salyer\n     discloses a surgical reamer and a disposable acetabular reamer cup. The\n     first patent does not disclose a disposable shaft while the second and\n     third patents does not assure the concentricity of the cutting bowl with\n     respect to that of the shaft.\n[0007] U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,165 to Salyer discloses an acetabular reamer\n     cup. This \'165 patent does not have a disposable shaft and the\n     arrangement used has no direct connection between the shaft and the\n     cutting howl other than through the base aperture. The concentricity of\n     the cutting bowl with respect to that of the shaft is therefore not\n     assured.\n[0008] U.S. Pat. No, 5,658,290 to Lechot discloses an assembly comprising\n     reamer spindle and reamer for surgery. The reamer comprises a cap and at\n     least three radial rods which are arranged uniformly on the inside edge\n     of the cap and join up integrally at the center of the cap. The reamer\n     spindle comprises a shank on which there is fixed a reamer spindle head\n     that is equipped with a bayonet with locking means for the securing of\n     the reamer. The securing catches of the bayonet are intended to receive\n     the radial rods of the reamer. The connection between the reamer rods and\n     bayonet does not provide a precise centerline matching arrangement. The\n     shaft is not indicated to be disposable\n[0009] U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,688, as well as U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,001,105, and\n     6,428,543 to Salyer disclose an acetabular reamer cup and method of\n     producing the same. The bottom has a tool driver opening coaxial and is\n     concentric with the cutting bowl. The driver opening engages with the\n     shaft, which drives the acetabular reamer. This form of attachment of the\n     shaft with the acetabular reamer does not ensure alignment of axis of the\n     shaft with that of the acetabular reamer. The acetabular reamer or the\n     shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n[0010] U.S. Pat. No. 5,755,719 to Frieze, et al. discloses an acetabular\n     reamer. This acetabular reamer includes a base, a first set of\n     semi-circular blades attached to the base, and a second set of\n     semi-circular blades also contacting said base, and crossing and\n     intersecting with said first set of blades at right angles thereto. The\n     base preferably comprises a circular plate having a hexagonal drive hole\n     in the center thereof and a plurality of slots in the periphery thereof\n     for anchoring the blades. The drive shaft is coupled to a hexagonal\n     aperture in the base plate. This method of attachment does not align the\n     hemispherical cutter centerline with that of the drive shaft. As such,\n     the arrangement causes wobbliness of the cutter in the bone cavity. The\n     shaft of the acetabular reamer is not indicated to be disposable.\n[0011] U.S. Pat. No. 5,976,144 to Fishbein et al. discloses a hollow dome\n     reamer with removable teeth. A drive shaft is connected to the base plate\n     through an aperture in the base plate and held in place by a spring.\n     There is no direct attachment of the shaft to the dome and this multitude\n     of connections to the shaft does not assure that the centerline of the\n     shaft coincides with that of the hollow dome. The shaft is not indicated\n     to be disposable.\n[0012] U.S. Pat. No. 5,980,170 to Salyer as well as U.S. Pat. Nos.\n     5,817,096, 5,501,686, 5,282,804, 5,236,433, 5,171,313, 5,171,312 disclose\n     a tool driver. This tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and\n     opposite ends. A boss is secured at one of said shaft ends by which the\n     tool driver is connected to a rotary tool. A tool collate is secured at\n     the other of the shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a\n     surgical hand piece having a chuck in which the collate may be\n     positioned. The boss has a distal end surface with a groove therein. Both\n     the groove and the distal end surface extend transversely of the axis. A\n     pin is positioned in the groove on the axis. A latch mechanism is\n     provided to hold a mounting bar of a rotary tool in the groove on the\n     pin, whereby the rotary tool is held exactly coaxially of the driver\n     during use. The rotary tool, which is used with the driver has a bar\n     which has the same dimensions as the groove in the boss of the tool\n     driver of the invention. The bar thus fills the slot and is complementary\n     to the slot. The bar has a hole therein which is complementary to the\n     pin. The pin extends coaxially of the shaft and the boss. The bar hole in\n     which the pin of the tool driver is positioned is precisely coaxial of\n     the axis of the tool about which the cutting edges are precisely\n     positioned. The tool driver has a shaft appointed to receive acetabular\n     reamer cups and patella cutters. The cutters are appointed to be\n     connected to the by of the shaft by means of mounting bar in the cutter\n     and a slot in the shaft secured by a complementary pin. This method of\n     attachment--using a mounting bar that slides into a slot--does not align\n     the centerline of the shaft with that of the reamer. Moreover, the shaft\n     is not indicated to be disposable.\n[0013] U.S. Pat. No. 6,168,600 to Grace, et al discloses an acetabular\n     reamer backing plate and method of use. The backing plate for an\n     acetabular reamer assembly that has a planar surface allows for the\n     attachment of a reamer driver. This attachment feature only uses a single\n     point attachment of the reamer to the shaft at the edge profile of the\n     backing plate. It is therefore subject to displacement of the shaft\n     laterally, causing the centerlines of the shaft and reamer to be not\n     precisely aligned. The shaft is not indicated to he disposable.\n[0014] U.S. Pat. No. 6,409,732 to Salyer discloses a tool driver. This\n     tool driver has a shaft with a longitudinal axis and opposite ends. A\n     boss is secured at one of the shaft ends by which the tool driver is\n     connected to a rotary tool. A tool collate is secured to the other of the\n     shaft ends by which the tool driver may be driven by a surgical hand\n     piece having a chuck in which the collate may be positioned. The boss is\n     equipped with a securing device of the bayonet type having a latch\n     mechanism, which holds the rotary tool on the boss coaxially of the\n     driver during use. The securing device has a tapered bore extending from\n     the distal end of the boss axially of the shaft. The rotary tool has a\n     diametrical bar extending across a bottom tool driver opening with a\n     centrally located circular disk therein. The disk of the rotary tool fits\n     within the bore of the tool shaft boss so as to concentrically locate the\n     rotary tool and the tool shaft on the same axis. The latch mechanism\n     holds the tool driver and the tool together in this position, whereby\n     rotary tools of a multitude of sizes can be secured concentrically to the\n     tool shaft without holding a plurality of critical tolerances when\n     machining the bayonet type securing device or the rotary tool bottom bar.\n     The tool driver is a shaft with a slot on the end that receives the\n     acetabular reamer. It deals with the details of the device for attaching\n     the acetabular reamer to the shaft. This type of slotted attachment does\n     not result in coaxial mounting of the reamer that is coincident with the\n     centerline of the shaft, even though the different components of the\n     shaft are said to be coaxially aligned. The reamer or the shaft is not\n     indicated to be disposable.\n[0015] U.S. Pat. No. 6,875,217 to Wolford discloses an orthopedic reamer\n     assembly. This orthopedic reamer assembly includes a reamer with a\n     generally hemispherical shell having a concave side and at least one\n     attachment feature associated with the concave side. A driver is\n     attachable to the reamer and has a shaft with a reamer end. A releasable\n     collar is disposed on the reamer end, which includes a boss having at\n     least one retaining pin. A sleeve is fitted over the boss and includes a\n     groove that is proximate to a corresponding retaining pin. The reamer has\n     a cavity in the reamer end with a biasing element. The biasing element\n     biases the sleeve in a closed position respective to the boss. A release\n     pin, which press fits into the sleeve is provided in the reamer end, and\n     is conveyed through the cavity, with the biasing element biasing against\n     the release pin. The orthopedic reamer assembly is a complicated\n     attachment of design of the drive shaft to an acetabular reamer with\n     multiple sliding parts. Since each of the sliding parts requires a\n     sliding fit, there are inherent displacement possibilities and therefore,\n     the centerline of the shaft is not reliably aligned with the centerline\n     of the acetabular reamer. Moreover, the acetabular reamer or the shaft is\n     not indicated to be disposable and requires complicated machined elements\n     to enable a sliding fit.\n[0016] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0181916 to Wolford\n     discloses an orthopedic reamer with flat cutting teeth. This orthopedic\n     reamer is for cutting bone and includes a shaft and a head coupled with\n     the shaft. The head includes a distal face with a plurality of cutting\n     teeth. Each cutting tooth includes a hole extending through the head. At\n     least a portion of each hole has a substantially round perimeter. A\n     raised lip is positioned adjacent to and extends around at least part of\n     the substantially round portion. The \'916 publication discloses an\n     orthopedic reamer with flat cutting teeth having a shaft attached to\n     acetabular reamer cups. The reamer cups or the shaft of the \'916\n     publication are not disposable in nature. The attachment of the\n     acetabular reamer to the drive shaft includes a complicated mechanism and\n     does not reliably align the centerline of the drive shaft with that of\n     the acetabular reamer. As such, wobble free rotation is not provided.\n[0017] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0088757 to Tulkis\n     discloses an acetabular reamer. The reamer assembly includes a tool\n     driver and a tool. Tool driver comprises a shaft. The tool receiving end\n     of the shaft has a flange. Formed in the flange are four L-shaped bayonet\n     catches, which receive the tool. The tool has a body having slots. A\n     cutter can slidably fit into the slots. When installed in the slots, the\n     cutters project slightly above the body. The projecting portions of the\n     cutters form the cutting edges for shaving or cutting tissue. The reamer\n     is formed by attaching a tool to the tool driver by lowering it in the\n     L-shaped bayonet catches. The reamer can be coupled to a drive means such\n     as a hand drill and inserted in a body cavity. Operating the reamer\n     against body tissue shaves of body tissue. This type of four L-shaped\n     bayonet catches attaching a shaft to a reamer does not provide precise\n     alignment of the centerline of the reamer and the shaft since it is a\n     single location attachment and is subject to rotational movement. The\n     shaft is not indicated to be disposable.\n[0018] Foreign Publication No. WO 9007908 to Schelhas discloses an\n     acetabulum reamer. Acetabulum reamer for reaming the acetabulum of the\n     human pelvic bone prior to insertion of an artificial hip joint cup\n     comprises a reamer head on a shaft and a spiral reaming ridge arranged\n     about the axis of the shaft and provided with reaming devices. The outer\n     edge of the reaming ridge is delimited by a section of a spherical\n     surface whose axis of rotation is flush with the axis of the shaft. The\n     acetabulum reamer utilizes a spherical head for reaming a socket in an\n     acetabulum. The spherical shape of the multiple use reamer provides the\n     ability to hollow out the arcuate shape of the bone joints.\n     Significantly, the acetabulum reamer publication does not teach a\n     disposable spherical hollow surgical reamer tool that is attached to a\n     drive shaft with coincident centerlines.\n[0019] A number of prior art patents disclose use of polymeric shaft for\n     delivering rotational torque. These polymeric shafts generally are\n     tubular in construction with glass fibers or carbon fibers embedded in\n     the polymer matrix. However, these polymeric shafts are rather large in\n     diameter and short in overall length and generally unsuited for reamer\n     shafts, which are required to be small in diameter and long in length.\n[0020] U.S. Pat. No. 4,171,626 to Yates, et al. discloses a carbon fiber\n     reinforced composite drive shaft.

A layer of adhesive material is disposed\n     between an outer surface of the metal sleeve and an inner surface of the\n     shaft body to bond the sleeve to the body. This composite shaft assembly\n     with adhesively bonded is not indicated to connect to a hollow reamer.\n[0023] There remains a need in the art for a modular easy-to-assemble\n     spherical or tapered hollow reamer for medical applications having a\n     disposable reamer shaft. Also needed in the art is a disposable spherical\n     hollow or tapered cutter assembly, which can be attached concentric to a\n     reusable shaft portion that provides means for reaming of a bone cavity\n     without wobbly movement. Further needed in the art is a cutter assembly\n     having means for collecting bone debris and keeping the collected debris\n     displaced from the cutting portion, so that heat generated at the bone\n     cutting surface is minimized. Still further needed in the art is a\n     disposable shaft for a spherical hollow or tapered reamer assembly\n     wherein, after one use of the spherical or tapered hollow reamer, a clean\n     contamination-free replacement shaft is provided.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n[0024] The present invention provides a disposable shaft for reamers.\n     Reamer shafts are long with a shaft length in the range of 250 to 400\n     millimeters. These shafts have a small shaft diameter typically in the\n     range of 4 to 14 millimeters, preferably 5 millimeters for hollow\n     tattered reamers and 14 mm for spherical hollow reamers. The shaft must\n     have certain features for the concentric attachment of the disposable\n     shaft with a disposable modular hollow reamer. Moreover, the other side\n     of the disposable shaft requires certain features for attachment to a\n     drill or suitable drive drain. Machining such small-diameter long-length\n     shafts with precision is generally difficult and time consuming; this\n     results in reamer shaft cost that is well over thousand dollars. The\n     shafts may be rigid or flexible depending on the type and orientation of\n     the bone cavity being surgically reamed. The reamer shaft may be solid or\n     cannulated, meaning that it has a central hole for inserting a guide pin.\n[0025] Precisely dimensioned rods as well as tubes are readily available\n     in the market place. Precision machining of small sized attachment pieces\n     is readily carried out at a low manufacturing cost. The present invention\n     contemplates attaching these small sized attachment pieces to a standard\n     commercially available precision rods and tubes using gluing methods\n     including use of epoxy glues in a fixture that creates precise alignment\n     of the rod or tube shaft with the attachment pieces, one at each end. The\n     attachment features may be affixed with an aperture drilled within the\n     rod or affixed over the outside diameter of the rod or tube.\n     Conveniently, the hole present within the tube may be used for affixing\n     the attachment pieces. The attachment pieces are configured according to\n     the attachment requirements of a specific modular reamer to which the\n     disposable reamer shaft will be attached and may be a male threaded or\n     female threaded screw attachment. The other side of the rod or tube is\n     glued to an attachment piece that is a chuck drive, J&J drive or other\n     driver that connects to other drive mechanisms.\n[0026] Solid rigid shafts are made from precisely dimensioned rod stock of\n     stainless steel or other suitable alloy or fiber reinforced plastic.\n     Cannulated shafts are made from precisely dimensioned tubular stock.\n     Flexible shafts solid or cannulated are made from Nitinol or fiber\n     reinforced plastic. The fiber reinforced plastic may have fiber wraps\n     surrounding a polymeric rod or tube that circumferentially reinforced for\n     transmitting torque. The solid Nitinol shaft may be wire cut in a helical\n     pattern to provide a spring like structure providing the desired\n     flexibility. This wire cutting step may increase the reamer cost due to\n     machining operation. However, when the shaft is required to be rigid\n     additional fiber reinforcement is provided along the longitudinal length\n     of the shaft to limit flexure. The reinforcing fibers may be selected\n     from carbon filaments, boron filaments, glass fibers, polyaramid fibers\n     (Kenval.TM.), liquid crystal long chain polymer fibers (Spectra.TM.) or\n     combinations thereof.\n[0027] Specifically, the attachment between the disposable spherical or\n     tapered hollow reamer and the disposable shaft is accomplished by a\n     precision threaded screw attachment at one end and a support feature at a\n     distance away from the first threaded attachment location. This provides\n     two attachment locations that are at a distance from each other providing\n     precise rotational centerline alignment of the reamer shaft and the\n     hollow reamer. The disposable reamer shaft has at one end a corresponding\n     metallic fitting with precision threads adapted to connect to threads of\n     the hollow reamer.\n[0028] The process for manufacturing the low cost disposable reamer shaft\n     disposable spherical or tapered hollow reamer involves the following\n     steps:   [0029] 1. selecting a rod stock or tube stock with a precise\n     outer diameter in the range of 4 to 14 millimeters; [0030] 2. cutting the\n     rod or tube to required shaft length in the range of 250 to 400\n     millimeters for a disposable reamer shaft; [0031] 3. providing rod or\n     tube end configuration for receiving attachment pieces; [0032] 4.\n     machining attachment pieces with precise threads for attachment to a\n     modular hollow reamer on one side and attachment pieces for attachment to\n     drive power unit on one end, both types of pieces provided with an\n     appropriate geometry for attachment for ends of a rod or tube; and [0033]\n     5. gluing with epoxy using a fixture that aligns centerlines a tube or\n     rod with a modular hollow reamer attachment piece on one end and a drive\n     connecting attachment piece of the other end; [0034] wherein said low\n     cost disposable reamer shaft is solid or flexible with or without\n     cannulation is fabricated from stainless steel, reinforced plastic or\n     Nitinol and is centerline matched to hollow reamer.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n[0035] The invention will be more fully understood and further advantages\n     will become apparent when reference is had to the following detailed\n     description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings,\n     in which:\n[0036] FIG. 1 illustrates a cross sectional view depicting a first\n     embodiment of a disposable reamer shaft attached to one design of\n     disposable modular spherical hollow reamer;\n[0037] FIG. 2 Illustrates a cross sectional view depicting a first\n     embodiment of a disposable reamer shaft attached to one design of\n     disposable modular spherical hollow reamer;\n[0038] FIG. 3 Illustrates a cross sectional view depicting a second\n     embodiment of a disposable reamer shaft attached to another design of\n     disposable modular spherical hollow reamer; and\n[0039] FIG. 4 Illustrates a cross sectional view depicting a third\n     embodiment of a disposable reamer shaft attached to a design of\n     disposable modular tapered hollow reamer.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n[0040] In orthopedic surgery, total hip replacements require reaming the\n     internal geometry of the acetabulum in order to establish a precise fit\n     for the implant. This preparation can be intended for either cementing an\n     acetabular cup (preparation would be oversized to the implant) or press\n     fitting an acetabular cup (preparation undersized to the implant). In\n     either case, a spherically shaped cutter is used to machine the internal\n     geometry of the acetabulum. These spherical cutting tools are required to\n     cut both cortical bone (hard bone) and cancellous bone (spongy bone)\n     during normal surgery. The spherical cutter is generally assembled to a\n     drive shaft which is coupled to a power drill and this assembly is used\n     to machine the acetabulum for the implant. These cutters are intended for\n     multiple surgeries and are used many times for many patients. The cutting\n     action of these reamers is afforded by a plurality of cutting teeth.\n     Because these teeth encounter hard bone and they are used multiple times,\n     the cutters can become dull and inefficient in their cutting ability. Two\n     primary problems exist with this type of instrument and surgical method:\n[0041] 1. Since these spherical cutters are reused, special attention is\n     needed in properly cleaning them prior to use in preparing the next\n     patient\'s acetabulum.\n[0042] 2. The cutting teeth can become dull even after one use and\n     therefore do not cut bone efficiently. In addition, this cutting\n     inefficiency generates friction/heat which can damage or kill the\n     surrounding bone.\n[0043] As these cutters become dull, they also do not cut an accurate\n     preparation for implant either in size or spherical geometry. Even\n     initially, these cutters can be not accurately concentric which is\n     further compounded by the wear and use of the cutter. Although these\n     cutters are intended for multiple uses, there are really not quality\n     control measures which monitor their function and eventual need to be\n     replaced. There are not programs/qualified personnel in the hospitals\n     that can inspect and evaluate the function and dimensional accuracy of\n     the cutters after they have been used. It would be beneficial for the\n     patient and the hospital to be assured that the surgeon could always be\n     supplied with a clean/sterile spherical cutter with accurate and sharp\n     cutting teeth for every clinical case.\n[0044] Reaming of bone cavity is required during many orthopedic surgical\n     procedures. These procedures include hip replacement and shoulder\n     replacement and the like. Reaming of the bone cavities for the placement\n     of an acetabular cup requires milling of precisely shaped bone cavity.\n     When the acetabular cup is fixed by interference, this precision is more\n     critical than when the acetabular cup is bonded to the bone cavity by a\n     cement composition.\n[0045] Generally stated, the disposable reamer shaft for disposable\n     modular spherical or tapered hollow reamer for medical applications\n     broadly comprises: (i) a disposable reamer shaft made from a rod or tube\n     stock having precise outer diameter; (ii) one end of said rod or tube\n     stock glued with epoxy or other suitable glue to a hollow reamer\n     attachment piece that has appropriate affixing features portion at one\n     end and threaded connection at its other end for attachment to said\n     hollow reamer; (iii) other end of said rod or tube stock glued with epoxy\n     or other suitable glue to power drive attachment piece that has\n     appropriate affixing features portion at one end and chuck connection\n     features on its other end.\n[0046] The reamer shaft especially cannulated versions and flexible\n     versions accumulate body fluids in the bent region as well as the\n     cannulated central hole, which are impossible to clean contaminating the\n     next patient when the reamer shaft is reused. The precision machining\n     requirement of a long small diameter reamer shaft is very expensive\n     resulting in reamer shaft cost in the range of several thousands of\n     dollars. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a low cost disposable\n     reamer shaft combating these contamination issues and reamer cost.\n[0047] The disposable reamer shaft must be provided on one end with\n     attachment features suited for attachment to disposable modular spherical\n     or tapered hollow reamers with a precise centerline attachment. The other\n     end of the disposable reamer shaft must have attachment features to\n     connect the reamer shaft to a power drive unit. The disposable modular\n     spherical hollow reamer disclosed in previously filed applications\n     bearing Attorney Docket Nos.: 0297-3 CIP2 and 0297-3 CIP5 disclose two\n     different geometries providing support of the modular spherical hollow\n     reamer at two locations displaced at a distance from each other assuring\n     concentric attachment of the reamer to the centerline of the shaft. The\n     previously filed application bearing Attorney Docket No.: 0297-3 CIP and\n     0297-3 CIP4 discloses a geometry providing support of the modular tapered\n     hollow reamer at two locations displaced at a distance from each other\n     assuring concentric attachment of the reamer to the centerline of the\n     shaft. These arrangements of the disposable reamer shaft are disclosed in\n     FIGS. 2 through 4 below.\n[0048] FIG. 2 Illustrates at 20 a cross sectional view depicting a first\n     embodiment of a disposable reamer shaft attached to one design of\n     disposable modular spherical hollow reamer. The right side of the sub\n     figure of FIG. 2 marked A depicts the manufactured disposable spherical\n     hollow reamer. It has a cutting spherical shell 25 with a welded first\n     plate at 26 having a threaded aperture and a second welded plate 27 with\n     a central aperture. The drive shaft 21 for this disposable modular\n     spherical hollow reamer is shown to be a solid rod in the sub figure of\n     FIG. 2, marked B and as a tube in the sub figure of FIG. 2, marked B1\n     representing a cannulated disposable reamer shaft. In both cases, the\n     right side of the rod or tube has a milled aperture to receive the\n     modular hollow reamer attachment piece 22, which is glued by epoxy at 24.\n     The other end of the rod or tube 21 is glued to a J&J drive chuck 23 also\n     using epoxy glue at 24. Note that the J&J drive chuck 23 slides over the\n     rod or tube 21 creating the disposable reamer shaft. The finished\n     disposable reamer shaft is shown at subfigure of FIG. 2, marked at C for\n     a solid shaft and at C1 for a cannulated shaft. A chuck drive is shown at\n     subfigure of FIG. 2, marked D. The attachment piece 22 screws into the\n     aperture of the first welded plate 26, a first attachment point for the\n     disposable reamer shaft. The sliding of the outer surface inside the\n     aperture of second welded plate 27 provides a second attachment point.\n     These two displaced attachment locations provide precise alignment of the\n     centerline disposable reamer Shaft with that of the modular spherical\n     hollow reamer.\n[0049] FIG. 3 Illustrates at 30 a cross sectional view depicting a second\n     embodiment of a disposable reamer shaft attached to one design of\n     disposable modular spherical hollow reamer. The right side of the sub\n     figure of FIG. 3, marked A depicts the manufactured disposable spherical\n     hollow reamer. It has a cutting spherical shell 36 has a welded female\n     screw thread at 37. The drive shaft 31 for this disposable modular\n     spherical hollow reamer is shown to be a solid rod in the sub figure of\n     FIG. 3, marked B and as a tube in the sub figure of FIG. 3, marked B1\n     representing a cannulated disposable reamer shaft. In both cases, the\n     left side of the modular reamer attachment piece 32 has a milled aperture\n     to receive right side of the rod or tube 31, which is glued by epoxy at\n     35. A tapered conical element 34 is also glued by epoxy to the shaft as\n     shown at 35 and slides over the interior of the spherical dome of the\n     reamer 36. The other end of the rod or tube 31 is glued to a J&J drive\n     chuck 23 also using epoxy glue at 24. The finished disposable reamer\n     shaft is shown at subfigure of FIG. 3, marked at C for a solid shaft and\n     at C1 for a cannulated shaft. The attachment piece 32 screws into the\n     threaded aperture 37, a first attachment point for the disposable reamer\n     shaft. The sliding of the outer surface of glued plate 34 inside the\n     spherical dome of spherical reamer 36 provides a second attachment point.\n     These two displaced attachment locations provide precise alignment of the\n     centerline disposable reamer shaft with that of the modular spherical\n     hollow reamer. A chuck drive is shown at subfigure of FIG. 3, marked D.\n[0050] FIG. 4 Illustrates at 40 a cross sectional view depicting a third\n     embodiment of a disposable reamer shaft attached to a disposable modular\n     tapered hollow reamer. The right side of the sub figure of FIG. 4, marked\n     A depicts the assembled modular tapered hollow reamer with a finished\n     shaft. The sub figure of FIG. 4, marked B depicts how the tapered hollow\n     reamer is disassembled. The drive shaft 41 for this disposable modular\n     tapered hollow reamer is shown to be a solid rod in the sub figure of\n     FIG. 4, marked C and as a tube in the sub figure of FIG. 3, marked C1\n     representing a cannulated disposable reamer shaft. In both cases, the\n     right side of rode or tube 41 has a milled aperture to receive the left\n     side of the attachment piece 42, which is glued by epoxy at 45.

 'patent_description': u'CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application\n     No. 61/697,177, which was filed on Sep. 5, 2012, and U.S. Provisional\n     Application No. 61/790,528, which was filed on Mar. 15, 2013, both of\n     which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n       FIELD\n[0002] The present disclosure relates to embodiments of a femoral hip\n     implant.\nBACKGROUND\n[0003] There are two primary methods of fixation for femoral hip implants\n     in total hip replacement. The first method utilizes bone cement to bond\n     the femoral hip implant to the surrounding bone. The second method relies\n     on a press fit between the femoral hip implant and the bone to promote\n     long term stability. Such press fit implants are commonly tapered to\n     resist post-operative subsidence into the bone canal, and can include\n     porous surfaces to promote bone ingrowth. Many press fit implants also\n     include a collar that rests on the calcar area of the femur, acting to\n     restrain subsidence and allow load sharing between the bone and the\n     implant.\nSUMMARY\n[0004] In some embodiments, a bone implant apparatus is provided. The\n     apparatus comprises a first end having a substantially smooth surface to\n     inhibit bone ingrowth, a second end extending from the first end in a\n     non-coaxial fashion with a tapered shape and a surface, at least a\n     portion of which comprises a porous surface to allow bone ingrowth, and a\n     collar located between the first and second end. The collar further\n     comprises a porous surface to allow bone ingrowth into the collar.\n[0005] In some implementations, a femoral hip implant is provided\n     comprising a first end, the first end having a substantially smooth\n     surface to inhibit bone ingrowth, a second end having a substantially\n     tapered shape and extending from the first end in a non-coaxial fashion,\n     at least a portion of which comprises a porous surface to allow bone\n     ingrowth, and a collar located between the first end and the second end,\n     at least a portion of the collar having a porous surface to allow bone\n     ingrowth. The second end of the femoral hip implant is inserted into a\n     femur, and the femoral hip implant is positioned to subside into the\n     femur until the collar contacts the femur so that the porous surfaces of\n     the second end and the collar are aligned with bone to allow bone\n     ingrowth.\n[0006] The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the\n     invention will become more apparent from the following detailed\n     description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0007] FIG. 1 is a side elevation view of a femoral hip implant.\n[0008] FIG. 2 is an enlarged isometric view of a femoral hip implant.\n[0009] FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a femoral hip implant in a\n     femur.\n[0010] FIG. 4A is a front view showing a hip joint before total hip\n     replacement.\n[0011] FIG. 4B is a front view of a femoral hip implant showing a gap\n     between a femur and a collar.\n[0012] FIG. 4C is a front view of a femoral hip implant showing a collar\n     in contact with a femur.\n[0013] FIG. 4D is a magnified view of FIG. 4B.\n[0014] FIG. 4E is a magnified view of FIG. 4C.\n[0015] FIG. 5 is a representation of the geometric pattern of a porous\n     surface.\n[0016] FIG. 6 is a micrograph of the geometric pattern of a porous\n     surface.\n[0017] FIG. 7 is a front view of a diamond cubic unit cell geometry of a\n     porous surface of a femoral hip implant.\n[0018] FIG. 8 is a diagram showing cross-section of a collar and\n     application of a force to the collar.\n[0019] FIG. 9 is a diagram showing the deflection of a collar under load.\n[0020] FIG. 10 is a side elevation view of a femoral hip implant having an\n     alternative embodiment of a collar.\n[0021] FIG. 11 is a side elevation view of the femoral hip implant of FIG.\n     1 illustrating a length of the collar.\n[0022] FIG. 12 is a side elevation view of the femoral hip implant of FIG.\n     10 illustrating a length of the collar.\n[0023] FIG. 13 is a side elevation view of another embodiment of a femoral\n     hip implant.\n[0024] FIG. 14 is an enlarged isometric view of a portion of the femoral\n     hip implant of FIG. 13.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n[0025] For purposes of this description, certain aspects, advantages, and\n     novel features of the embodiments of this disclosure are described\n     herein. The disclosed methods, apparatuses, and systems should not be\n     construed as limiting in any way. Instead, the present disclosure is\n     directed toward all novel and nonobvious features and aspects of the\n     various disclosed embodiments, alone and in various combinations and\n     sub-combinations with one another. The methods, apparatus, and systems\n     are not limited to any specific aspect or feature or combination thereof,\n     nor do the disclosed embodiments require that any one or more specific\n     advantages be present or problems be solved.\n[0026] Although the operations of some of the disclosed methods are\n     described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation,\n     it should be understood that this manner of description encompasses\n     rearrangement, unless a particular ordering is required by specific\n     language set forth below. For example, operations described sequentially\n     may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently. Moreover, for\n     the sake of simplicity, the attached figures may not show the various\n     ways in which the disclosed methods can be used in conjunction with other\n     methods. Additionally, the description sometimes uses terms like\n     "provide" or "achieve" to describe the disclosed methods. These terms are\n     high-level abstractions of the actual operations that are performed. The\n     actual operations that correspond to these terms may vary depending on\n     the particular implementation and are readily discernible by one of\n     ordinary skill in the art.\n[0027] As used in this application and in the claims, the singular forms\n     "a," "an," and "the" include the plural forms unless the context clearly\n     dictates otherwise. Additionally, the term "includes" means "comprises."\n     Further, the terms "coupled" and "associated" generally mean\n     electrically, electromagnetically, and/or physically (e.g., mechanically\n     or chemically) coupled or linked and does not exclude the presence of\n     intermediate elements between the coupled or associated items absent\n     specific contrary language.\n[0028] As used herein, the term "porous" means a structure having one or\n     more openings, gaps, or other such surfaces that allow bone to grow into\n     the structure and mechanically interlock with the structure. "Bone\n     ingrowth" refers to the growing of bone into a porous structure in a\n     manner that allows the bone to interlock with the structure.\n[0029] As used herein, the term "smooth" means a structure lacking in\n     openings, gaps, or other such surfaces that would allow bone to grow into\n     the structure.\n[0030] A collar with a porous surface acts to stabilize a femoral hip\n     implant by promoting bone ingrowth. However, due to manufacturing\n     limitations, the existing art implants often comprise a solid metal\n     collar with only a textured undersurface. Such textured undersurfaces are\n     ineffective at promoting bone ingrowth, and frequently cause bone\n     resorption under the collar instead. Such bone resorption in turn can\n     cause the femoral hip implant to loosen in some cases, and can result in\n     undesirable revision surgery.\n[0031] FIGS. 1-2 depict an embodiment of a femoral hip implant 10. Femoral\n     hip implant 10 comprises a first end 12 (e.g., a proximal portion) having\n     a substantially smooth surface, a second end 14 (e.g., a distal portion)\n     extending distally from the first end 12 in a non-coaxial fashion, and a\n     collar 16 positioned between the first end 12 and the second end 14. In\n     some embodiments, the first end 12 is adapted to receive a femoral head\n     (not shown) and the second end 14 has a tapered shape generally\n     comprising a femoral stem and a porous region 18. In some embodiments,\n     first end 12, second end 14, and the collar 16 are integrally formed from\n     a single piece of material. Additionally, the femoral hip implant 10 can\n     be configured for both human and veterinary applications.\n[0032] The collar 16 can comprise a substantially semicircular projection\n     from second end 14 generally normal to the second end 14, as shown in\n     FIGS. 1-2. In this configuration, the collar 16 can contact the hard\n     calcar area 20 of the femur 22, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4E, allowing the\n     femoral hip implant 10 to transfer force to the bone when loaded.\n     Additionally, the collar 16 can prevent the femoral hip implant 10 from\n     subsiding into the femur 22 by contacting the calcar area 20 of the femur\n     22 to arrest motion of the femoral hip implant 10 into the bone canal.\n[0033] Collar 16 can comprise a top surface 24 and a bottom surface 26, as\n     shown in FIGS. 1-2. In some cases, the bottom surface 26 of the collar 16\n     will not contact the calcar area 20 of the femur 22 when the femoral hip\n     implant 10 is first implanted. Rather, the femoral hip implant 10 will\n     generally achieve a sufficiently tight press fit before it impacts into\n     the femur 22 far enough to allow the bottom surface 26 of the collar 16\n     to contact the calcar area 20, as shown in FIG. 4D. However, in some\n     cases, the tightness of the original press fit can decrease\n     post-operatively, allowing the femoral hip implant 10 to subside further\n     into the femur 22 and causing collar 16 to make contact with the calcar\n     area 20 of the femur 22, as shown in FIG. 4E. This action arrests further\n     subsidence of the femoral hip implant 10 into the femur 22 and aligns the\n     porous surfaces of the second end and the collar with bone to facilitate\n     bone ingrowth.\n[0034] In some embodiments, the collar 16 can be fully porous, with the\n     entire surface area of the collar 16 exhibiting porosity as shown in\n     FIGS. 1-2. Porous surfaces exhibiting proper geometry can promote bone\n     ingrowth, creating mechanical interlocking between the bone and the\n     femoral hip implant 10. Such bone ingrowth improves the long term\n     stability of the implant by reducing stress concentrations and bone\n     resorption, as well as improving the torsional strength of the implant\n     and reducing the likelihood of the need for revision surgery.\n[0035] In some embodiments, the top surface 24 of the collar 16 can\n     comprise a solid (i.e., non-porous) metal surface or skin. The solid\n     metal surface can be from about 0.005 inches to about 0.025 inches thick,\n     and can further strengthen the collar 16. In other embodiments, the\n     thickness of the metal at top surface 24 (the surface facing away from\n     the femur 22) can vary between between 0.005 inches to 0.08 inches thick,\n     or more preferably between 0.01 to 0.06 inches thick. An embodiment with\n     the top surface 24 being formed with a metal surface (e.g., a thin metal\n     "skin") is shown in FIGS. 12 and 13. All of the side of the collar 16 can\n     be formed with a porous surface as shown in FIG. 1; alternatively, all or\n     some of the side of the collar 16 can be formed with a non-porous metal\n     surface as shown in FIG. 14. In either embodiment (FIG. 1; FIG. 12), the\n     lower surface (i.e., the bone-contacting surface as shown in FIG. 3) of\n     collar 16 is preferably formed with a porous surface that can promote\n     bone ingrowth as discussed above.\n[0036] In some embodiments, the length L.sub.1 of the collar 16 can be\n     related to a cross-sectional dimension D of the second end 14, as shown\n     in FIG. 11. The length L.sub.1 of the collar 16 can be from about 12% to\n     about 26% of the cross-sectional dimension D of the second end 14. In\n     some embodiments, the length L.sub.1 of the collar 16 can be about 26% of\n     the dimension D of the second end.\n[0037] The femoral hip implant 10 described herein can be formed of\n     various biocompatible materials. In some embodiments, the femoral hip\n     implant 10 can be formed of titanium alloys, such as ASTM F-136 (Ti6Al4V\n     ELI Titanium Alloy). In other embodiments, the implants can be formed\n     using other biocompatible materials, such as cobalt chromium, stainless\n     steel, and various composite materials or plastics.\n[0038] Existing art implants require that the implant comprise multiple\n     parts joined together to achieve a porous surface on both the collar and\n     tapered body of the implant. However, using additive machining techniques\n     such as electron beam melting (EBM) or laser sintering, the femoral hip\n     implant 10 can be made from a single piece of material. In the case of\n     the EBM technique, the implant can be produced by building the implant\n     layer-by-layer from metal powder (e.g., a titanium alloy powder) using a\n     powerful electron beam. In the case of the laser sintering technique, a\n     high-powered laser is used to fuse beads of material to form the desired\n     three-dimensional structure. These techniques can be used to produce an\n     implant with the desired porous surfaces, allowing the porous surface of\n     the femoral hip implant 10 to extend from the porous region 28 of the\n     second end 14 to cover the entire surface area of the collar 16, as shown\n     in FIGS. 1-2.\n[0039] The porosity of the femoral hip implant 10 is generally of a\n     diamond cubic unit cell geometry, as shown in FIGS. 5-6, although any\n     geometry creating a three-dimensional structure of sufficient porosity to\n     allow bone ingrowth may be used. In some embodiments, the diamond cubic\n     unit cell geometry comprises a 7-14 diamond cubic unit cell structure\n     with approximately sixty-five percent of the interior volume comprising\n     space and thirty-five percent comprising solid material. Although any\n     ratio of space to solid material may be used, in some embodiments this\n     ratio can comprise a majority of space as compared to solid material. In\n     some embodiments, the diameter of the diamond unit cell structure is\n     approximately 300 .mu.m and the height is approximately 350 .mu.m, with a\n     pore size ranging from approximately 350-700 .mu.m, as shown in FIG. 7.\n     In some embodiments, the thickness is approximately 1000 .mu.m, although\n     any effective thickness may be used. Porosity of this size promotes bone\n     ingrowth with sufficient vascularity to the underlying bone without\n     compromising the structural integrity of the collar 16 under load.\n[0040] An additional feature of the collar 16 is its greater ability to\n     elastically deflect under load compared to existing art solid collars\n     with porous or textured surface treatments. The porosity of the collar 16\n     increases the elastic deflection of the collar 16 when subjected to\n     loading by reducing the ultimate strength of the collar 16. Existing art\n     collars fabricated from ASTM F-136 (Ti6Al4V ELI Titanium Alloy) with\n     cross-sections of 0.310 inches by 0.120 inches exhibit an ultimate\n     material stress of approximately 138,000 pounds per square inch with a\n     fracture force of approximately 466 pounds. Such existing art solid\n     collars generally are too stiff to deflect under normal loading\n     conditions induced in femoral implants, leading to stress disuse bone\n     resorption in the calcar area and destabilization of the implant.\n     However, in some embodiments of the femoral hip implant 10, the collar 16\n     exhibits an ultimate material stress of approximately 48,000 pounds per\n     square inch and a fracture load of approximately 163 pounds with a\n     cross-section of 0.310 inches by 0.120 inches, as shown in FIG. 8. This\n     reduction in the ultimate material stress and fracture force caused by\n     the porosity of collar 16 in turn causes increased elastic deflection of\n     collar 16 under load. As can be seen in FIG. 9, elastic deflection of\n     collar 16 ranges from less than 0.004 inches to nearly 0.020 inches as a\n     load ranging from 0 pounds to 188 pounds is applied. This elastic\n     deflection of collar 16 can stimulate bone regeneration around collar 16,\n     promoting bone ingrowth and long-term stabilization of the femoral hip\n     implant 10.\n[0041] Referring now to FIG. 10, there is shown an alternative embodiment\n     of a collar 116. The collar 116 can have a top surface 124 and a bottom\n     surface 126, and can be positioned between the first and second ends 12,\n     14 of the implant 10, similar to the collar 16 of FIG. 1. The collar 116\n     can also have an entirely porous surface to promote bone ingrowth. As\n     shown in FIG. 10, the bottom surface 126 of the collar 116 can form an\n     angle .alpha. with a longitudinal axis of the implant. In some\n     embodiments, the angle .alpha. can be from about 45 degrees to about 130\n     degrees. In some embodiments, the angle .alpha. can be about 110 degrees,\n     and the collar 116 can have a generally tapered shape corresponding to\n     the angle .alpha.. In this manner, the bending stress experienced by the\n     collar 116 in use can be further reduced.\n[0042] In some embodiments, the top surface 124 of the collar 116 can\n     comprise a solid (i.e., non-porous) metal surface similar to the solid\n     metal surface discussed above with respect to the embodiment of FIG. 1.\n     In some embodiments, the length L.sub.2 of the collar 116 can be related\n     to the cross-sectional dimension D of the second end 14, as shown in FIG.\n     12. The length L.sub.2 of the collar 116 can be from about 12% to about\n     26% of the cross-sectional dimension D of the second end 14, similar to\n     the collar of FIG. 1. In some embodiments, the length L.sub.2 of the\n     collar 16 can be about 12% of the dimension D of the second end, as shown\n     in FIG. 12. In this manner, the bending stress experienced by the collar\n     116 in use can be further reduced.\n[0043] In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of\n     the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the\n     illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and\n     should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention. Rather, the\n     scope of the invention is defined by the following claims. I therefore\n     claim as my invention all that comes within the scope and spirit of these\n     claims.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 'patent_description': u'CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n[0001] This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/741,211,\n     filed Jan. 14, 2013, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional\n     Application No. 61/586,685, which was filed on Jan. 13, 2012, and are\n     incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n       FIELD\n[0002] This disclosure relates to a novel systems and method relating to\n     cutting tools.\nBACKGROUND\n[0003] Cutting tools, such as medical reamers used by surgeons, generally\n     have a cutting surface that is able to cut and/or remove material from an\n     object. For example, in many different disciplines in orthopedics cutting\n     tools are used for machining bone in the preparation of artificial joints\n     including hips, knees, elbows and shoulders, and also in the repair of\n     long bone fractures. The design and method of manufacturing cutting\n     surfaces of cutting tools can affect the efficiency, functional life of\n     the spherical reamer and cost in manufacturing. Accordingly, improvements\n     relating to design and manufacturing methods are desirable.\nSUMMARY\n[0004] In some embodiments, improved cutting tools and methods of\n     manufacturing the same are provided.\n[0005] In certain implementations, the cutting tools comprise medical\n     reamers, including acetabular reamers, long bone cylindrical reamers,\n     long bone tapered reamers, patella reamers and glenoid reamers along with\n     the design of different cutting teeth in specific zones of the reamers\n     and the improved method of making these reamers and their cutting edges.\n[0006] In some implementations, a cutting tool is provided with a cutting\n     surface on a first side of the cutting tool and an attachment member on a\n     second side of the cutting tool. The cutting surface can include a\n     plurality of cutting edges and the attachment member can be configured to\n     be coupled to a powered driving member (e.g., a drill). The cutting tool\n     comprises an axis of rotation and the cutting surface defines a plurality\n     of latitude lines. The plurality of cutting edges can be oriented at\n     varying orientation angles relative to the latitude lines.\n[0007] In some implementations, the plurality of cutting edges can be in\n     three different zones and respective cutting edges in the different zones\n     have different characteristics. The different zones can comprise a polar\n     zone, a transition zone, and an equatorial zone. Respective cutting edges\n     can define a cutting angle between the cutting edge and a first side of\n     the cutting tool, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the\n     polar zone can be larger than those defined by cutting edges in the\n     transition zone, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the\n     transition zone can be larger than those defined by cutting edges in the\n     equatorial zone. In some implementations, the tooth height can be the\n     same (i.e., substantially the same) regardless of the cutting angle.\n[0008] In some implementations, the orientation angles vary depending on\n     whether the respective cutting edges are in the polar zone, the\n     transition zone, or the equatorial zone, and the orientation angle of\n     respective cutting edges in the equatorial zone is greater than the\n     orientation angle of respective cutting edges in the transition zone, and\n     the orientation angle of respective cutting edges in the transition zone\n     is greater than the orientation angle of respective cutting edges in the\n     polar zone.\n[0009] In some implementations, the thickness of the side wall is less\n     than 0.040 inches, or in some cases, between 0.022 inches and 0.40\n     inches. Openings can be provided adjacent respective cutting edges, the\n     respective openings defining a funnel angle that is between 20 and 40\n     degrees. In some cases, the funnel angle can be between 25 and 35\n     degrees.\n[0010] In some implementations, the cutting surface is a panel and the\n     cutting tool comprises a plurality of separate panels. The cutting tool\n     can include a frame member (e.g., a center support and a base) and the\n     plurality of separate panels can be coupled to the frame member.\n[0011] In another implementation, a method for forming a cutting tool is\n     provided. The method can include forming a plurality of panels from one\n     or more flat sheets of metal and coupling the plurality of panels to a\n     frame member to form the cutting tool. The plurality of panels can be\n     formed with a plurality of cutting edges and a plurality of openings\n     adjacent respective cutting edges. When coupled to the frame member, the\n     plurality of panels can define a plurality of latitude lines about the\n     axis of rotation of the cutting tool and the plurality of formed cutting\n     edges have orientation angles relative to the latitude lines that vary.\n     In some cases, respective panels can have cutting edges with orientation\n     angles that vary along the respective panel.\n[0012] In certain implementations, the act of forming a plurality of\n     panels comprises stamping the one or more flat sheets of metal to form a\n     plurality of cavities and punching holes at or adjacent to the plurality\n     of cavity to provide bone-chip-receiving openings. The act of forming the\n     plurality of cavities can include forming a plurality of "V"-shaped\n     cavities.\n[0013] In certain implementations, the act of forming the plurality of\n     panels can include stamping the one or more panels to create a desired\n     height of the cutting edges and to provide a desired curvature of the one\n     or more panels.\n[0014] In certain implementations, the act of coupling the plurality of\n     panels to the frame member can include forming a frame member that\n     comprises a center support, a base, and a form dome, and securing the\n     plurality of panels to the center support, the base, and the form dome.\n     In some cases, the act of securing the plurality of panels to the center\n     support, the base, and the form dome can be performed by laser welding or\n     other types of welding. The act of coupling the plurality of panels to\n     the frame member can also include placing the plurality of panels into an\n     injection molding tool and injection molding the frame member around the\n     plurality of panels to create the frame member.\n[0015] In some implementations, the act of forming a plurality of panels\n     from one or more flat sheets of metal can include forming the plurality\n     of cutting edges with different zones that have cutting edges with\n     different characteristics, the different zones comprising a polar zone, a\n     transition zone, and an equatorial zone. Respective cutting edges can\n     define a cutting angle between the cutting edge and a first side of the\n     cutting tool, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the polar\n     zone are larger than those defined by cutting edges in the transition\n     zone, and the cutting angle between cutting edges in the transition zone\n     are larger than those defined by cutting edges in the equatorial zone.\n[0016] In certain implementations, the act of punching holes at or\n     adjacent to the plurality of cavity comprises forming bone-chip-receiving\n     openings with a funnel angle that is between 20 and 40 degrees. In\n     addition, in some cases, the one or more flat sheets of metal have a\n     thickness less than 0.040 inches.\n[0017] In certain implementations, the method includes determining an\n     effective functional life of the cutting tool.\n[0018] In other embodiments, a cutting tool is provide that has a cutting\n     surface on a first side of the cutting tool, the cutting surface\n     comprising a plurality of cutting edges, and an attachment member on a\n     second side of the cutting tool, the attachment member being configured\n     to be coupled to a powered driving member. A plurality of cutting edges\n     are provided in at least three different zones and respective cutting\n     edges in the different zones have different characteristics.\n[0019] The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the\n     invention will become more apparent from the following detailed\n     description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0020] FIG. 1 illustrates an acetabular reamer, the use of the reamer to\n     prepare the acetabulum, and a press-fit acetabular implant positioned as\n     part of a total hip procedure.\n[0021] FIG. 2A illustrates an acetabular reamer with a hollow spherical\n     cutter.

Various changes to the described embodiments may be\n     made in the function and arrangement of the elements described herein\n     without departing from the scope of the invention.\n[0045] As used in this application and in the claims, the terms "a," "an,"\n     and "the" include both the singular and plural forms of the element(s)\n     they refer to unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n     Additionally, the term "includes" means "comprises." Further, the term\n     "coupled" generally means electrically, electromagnetically, and/or\n     physically (e.g., mechanically or chemically) coupled or linked and does\n     not exclude the presence of intermediate elements between the coupled or\n     associated items absent specific contrary language.\n[0046] As used herein, the term "effective functional life" means the\n     amount of use a tool can experience before it begins to operate\n     suboptimally for its intended purpose. In some embodiments, the effective\n     functional life can be based on a number of uses of the tool and/or an\n     amount of time the tool has been used. As used herein, the term\n     "single-use" tool or instrument means a tool or instrument that is\n     configured and/or intended to be used once before being discarded. Thus,\n     a single-use tool or instrument is a non-reuseable device in contrast to\n     reusable tools or instruments which, subject to certain procedures such\n     as cleaning and sterilization, may be used more than once. As used\n     herein, the term "powered driving member" means any device capable of\n     driving a cutting tool such as, for example, a drill.\n[0047] Although the operations of exemplary embodiments of the disclosed\n     method may be described in a particular, sequential order for convenient\n     presentation, it should be understood that disclosed embodiments can\n     encompass an order of operations other than the particular, sequential\n     order disclosed. For example, operations described sequentially may in\n     some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently. Further, descriptions\n     and disclosures provided in association with one particular embodiment\n     are not limited to that embodiment, and may be applied to any embodiment\n     disclosed.\n[0048] It is generally desirable that cutting surfaces on a cutting tool\n     (e.g., cutting teeth) be as accurate and consistent as possible for the\n     dimensional accuracy of the final preparation in the bone. For example,\n     cementless acetabular implants (press fit) are dependent on their\n     dimension and the dimension of the bone preparation to create a\n     reproducible interference fit for establishing initial stability of the\n     implant. FIG. 1 illustrates an acetabular reamer, the use of the reamer\n     to prepare the acetabulum, and a press-fit acetabular implant positioned\n     as part of a total hip procedure.\n[0049] The initial stability of the implant is critical to long term\n     success and if the implant moves large amounts (e.g., 75 microns or more)\n     under physiological loads post-operatively, it can result in soft tissue\n     growing into the implant rather than bone. If this occurs, the implant\n     will eventually loosen. Accordingly, the accuracy of the initial fit must\n     provide stability of the implant to allow bone to grow into the implant\n     during the first 6-12 weeks after surgery. In some instances, the\n     interference level required for cementless acetabular implants can be\n     required to be very small (e.g., less than 2 mm, and, in some cases,\n     preferably less than 1 mm). However, commercial cutters can vary in their\n     accuracy by as much as 0.25 mm and these variations can result in initial\n     acetabular implant stability. Because the initial interference fit\n     provides stability to the implant, improved accuracy of the teeth height\n     and performance can assist in achieving this goal.\n[0050] Configuration of Cutting Members\n[0051] Conventional reamer designs use the same cutting tooth geometry\n     within each design. These teeth are also positioned at 90.degree. to the\n     latitude lines of the spherical reamer surface. However, cutting teeth\n     around the equator of the reamer perform a side cutting function while\n     teeth towards the dome of the cutter perform an end cutting function.\n[0052] As described in more detail herein, various embodiments are\n     provided in which reamers utilize different cutting teeth configurations\n     and different orientations to address the different bone cutting\n     requirements and thereby improving the efficiency of the cut. By\n     efficiently designing cutting teeth for specific operations, faster bone\n     cuts can be achieved, thereby producing less friction. Minimizing the\n     friction generated by the reamers relates directly to maintaining the\n     life of the bone. Friction can lead to heat and if the cutter-bone\n     interface reaches temperatures above 50.degree. C. (122.degree. F.) bone\n     death (necrosis) can occur. This can affect long term success of the\n     procedure whether the implant is used with or without bone cement. If the\n     bone preparation bed is damaged due to excessive heat generated from the\n     acetabular cutter, the fixation of the implant will be compromised and\n     can lead to loosening and revision.\n[0053] There are two primary forces applied to the reamer during the\n     machining of the bone. When considering an acetabular reamer, as shown in\n     FIG. 2, there is an axial force applied by the surgeon who pushes the\n     cutter into the acetabulum and a second torsional force exerted by the\n     power reaming tool. In some embodiments, the novel cutting tools\n     disclosed herein convert the torsional force into a force applied at the\n     cutting tooth edge to improve the efficiency of the cut.\n[0054] The systems and methods described herein for forming cutting tools\n     can provide greater control and accuracy of the tooth sharpness, cutting\n     angles, and resulting bone chip removal by the tool. In addition, as\n     described in more detail below, the cutting tools described herein can be\n     formed by novel manufacturing processes that permit the creation of\n     multiple teeth in one operation.\n[0055] In the embodiments described herein, cutting surfaces (e.g., teeth)\n     can comprise a sharp tooth edge (tolerance 0.0005\'\' to 0.002\'\' tooth edge\n     radius), a specific tooth elevation (tolerance 0.002\'\'-0.004\'\'), specific\n     cutting angle, a specific tooth orientation to the axis of rotation\n     (e.g., tool angle), and a peripheral opening around the cutting edge\n     providing a designed flow path for the bone debris as shown in FIG. 3.\n     This tooth geometry can also be manufactured according to FIG. 4 through\n     a series of stamping operations allowing for multiple teeth to be made at\n     the same time. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 4, a flat sheet of\n     material (e.g., metal) can be stamped so that a plurality of "V"-type\n     cavities are punched into the sheet based on a desired cutting angle w.\n     Next, a plurality of holes can be punched around the "V"-type cavities\n     (or grooves), creating a cutting edge. If necessary, another stamping\n     step can be performed to stamp the tooth height and curvature in\n     operation (or multiple operations if desired). As shown in FIG. 4, angle\n     .beta. determines the tooth height and angle .beta. in conjunction with\n     angle a will determine the rake angle .omega. (.omega.=.alpha.-.beta.) of\n     the cutting surface. In some embodiments, the rake angle can vary between\n     about 5 and 25 degrees, and in other embodiments between about 5 and 15\n     degrees (e.g., about 10 degrees)\n[0056] Thus, in contrast to conventional devices, the tooth angle (a) can\n     be established in the first forming operation and can be set (.omega. and\n     .beta. angles) based on the intended function. Multiple iterations of\n     this tooth design can be provided in specific zones of the reamer surface\n     which address the intended type of cutting required at those locations.\n[0057] In some embodiments, the novel cutting tools disclosed herein can\n     have teeth arranged in a spiral or helix manner on the surface of the\n     cutter. However, the tooth designs and tooth orientations can be\n     optimized to reduce the reaming time required to complete the\n     preparation. As shown in FIGS. 5-8, the cutting edges of the teeth can be\n     oriented at different angles to the lines of latitude based on the\n     required cutting functions at various positions on the surface of the\n     reamer. This can provide for a faster cut by converting the rotational\n     energy into linear energy assisting in advancing the reamer into the\n     preparation analogous to a screw thread (FIG. 5). The tooth orientation\n     can further improve the cutting force at the tooth edge. By changing the\n     orientation of the cutting edge relative to the latitude lines, a portion\n     of the torsional force is converted into a cutting force at the tooth\n     edge as shown in FIG. 6. This improvement primarily benefits the teeth\n     closest to the equator as they are performing a side cutting function.\n[0058] As shown in FIGS. 5-6, the angle of orientation of the cutting edge\n     relative to axis of rotation can increase from the equatorial teeth to\n     the polar teeth and decrease relative to the latitude lines. At least\n     three different types of cutting teeth (e.g., orientation angles and/or\n     cutting angles varying) can be provided on the tool. In some embodiments,\n     at least three regions are provided with similar type teeth in each\n     region. In other embodiments, the teeth can vary in a transitional manner\n     effectively providing more than three zones.\n[0059] In some embodiments, relative to the latitude lines, the range of\n     variation can be orientation angles of between 10 and 30 degrees (more\n     preferably between 15 and 25 degrees--e.g., 20 degrees) for the\n     equatorial zone, orientation angles of less than 5 degrees (more\n     preferably about 0 degrees) in the polar zone, and somewhere in between\n     for the orientation angles in the transition zone (e.g., between 0 and 20\n     degrees, or preferably between 5 and 15 degrees--e.g., 10 degrees). A\n     benefit of the larger orientation angles in the equatorial zone is a\n     portion of the axial load applied by the operator will be converted into\n     driving the cutting edge into the bone. As you move to the polar zone,\n     the angle of the tooth on the surface has less effect as the tooth\n     becomes perpendicular to the direction of the cut. That is, the specific\n     tooth geometry in the polar zone needs to address an end cutting ability\n     rather than a side cutting ability.\n[0060] FIG. 7 illustrates an exemplary process by which a cutting tool\n     (e.g., a spherical reamer) transitions from engagement with the bone at\n     one area to another area of the cutting tool. As used herein, the term\n     "polar teeth" refer to cutting surfaces at and/or adjacent the pole of\n     the spherical reamer, the term "equatorial teeth" refer to cutting\n     surfaces at and/or adjacent to the equator of reamers having a\n     hemispherical shape (e.g., the area furthest from the poles in FIG. 7),\n     and the term "transition teeth" refer to cutting surfaces between the\n     polar and equatorial teeth.\n[0061] In the exemplary reaming process illustrated in FIG. 7, the\n     spherical reamer begins by introduction into the concave surface of the\n     acetabulum. It is noted that this initiation of the cut involves just the\n     equatorial teeth. These equatorial teeth are performing more of a side\n     cutting function and therefore can have a specific tooth angle based on\n     this intended function. Additional teeth (i.e., the transitional teeth)\n     become engaged with the bone as the reamer is further introduced into the\n     acetabulum. The transitional teeth perform a combination of side-cutting\n     and end-cutting and can be optimized for this purpose. As the reamer\n     becomes fully inserted into the preparation site, the teeth at the pole\n     (i.e., the polar teeth) of the reamer serve to primarily end-cut.\n[0062] Thus, the teeth can have different cutting demands depending on\n     their location on the surface of the reamer and can be configured\n     accordingly. FIG. 8 illustrates the manner in which the cutting angles of\n     the teeth can vary in accordance with the required cutting function of\n     the bone. The table below illustrates the types of teeth and their\n     configurations as reflected in FIG. 8.\n    TABLE-US-00001\n     Cutting angle (defined\n     relative to a side surface Tooth edge\n    Teeth Region of the cutting tool) radius Funnel angle Tooth height\n    Equatorial 15-35 degrees 0.0005-0.002\'\' 20-40 degrees, 0.020 .+-. 0.002\'\'\n     (more preferably, 20-30  (more preferably,\n     degrees)  25-35 degrees)\n    Transition 35-55 degrees 0.0005-0.002\'\' 20-40 degrees, 0.020 .+-. 0.002\'\'\n     (more preferably, 40-50  (more preferably,\n     degrees)  25-35 degrees)\n    Polar 55-75 degrees 0.0005-0.002\'\' 20-40 degrees, 0.020 .+-. 0.002\'\'\n     (more preferably, 60-70  (more preferably,\n     degrees)  25-35 degrees)\n[0063] Although, FIG. 8 illustrates these three zones as distinct zones,\n     it should be understood that the cutting surfaces can transition\n     gradually from one zone to another. Thus, polar teeth can transition\n     gradually from polar teeth with the orientation and characteristics noted\n     above to transition teeth with the orientation and characteristics noted\n     above. In this manner, for example, some teeth can have orientation and\n     characteristics of polar teeth (e.g., 65 degree cutting angle), some can\n     have characteristics of transition teeth (e.g., 45 degree cutting angle),\n     and some teeth between the polar teeth and transition teeth can have\n     characteristics somewhere inbetween (e.g., 55 degree cutting angle).\n[0064] Proper bone chip exit paths can also contribute to an improved\n     surgical preparation. With a non-impeded path for the bone chips to\n     travel away from the cutter, it enables the instrument to produce a\n     faster and cooler bone cut. As shown in FIG. 3, openings can be provided\n     adjacent cutting surfaces to provide a "funnel" that permits bone chips\n     to efficiently flow from the face of the reamer to avoid additional\n     torque requirements to drive the cutter. Without such openings, increased\n     torque is required to drive the cutting tool and such increased torque is\n     usually accompanied by increased axial pressure as the operator senses\n     the resistance in advancing the cutter and applies increased loads. This\n     combination generates increased heat through friction capable of\n     generating temperatures which can cause bone necrosis.\n[0065] Manufacturing of Cutting Tools\n[0066] In some embodiments, the novel cutting tools can be manufactured by\n     forming the spherical body and teeth from thinner sheet metal,\n     0.005\'\'-0.020\'\', which can improve the efficiency in manufacturing\n     (longer tool life of the forming tools) and ability to create a sharp\n     tooth edge without a specific sharpening operation. In addition the\n     thinner material better dissipates the heat generated from the friction\n     of cutting the bone over a thicker walled, heavier mass reamer. The\n     thinner material also produces less friction, therefore a lower\n     temperature at the surface, through reduction of the Coriolis forces\n     (FIG. 9).\n[0067] FIG. 10 illustrates a comparison of the frictional forces\n     associated with bone chips created by cutting tools having different\n     thicknesses. As shown in FIG. 10, for thicker walled cutters (e.g.,\n     cutters with wall thicknesses greater than 0.22\'\'), the bone chip\n     particles must travel a greater distance in contact with the cutting\n     surface of the cutter. As a result, lower temperatures can be achieved by\n     producing cutters with wall thickness of between 0.005\'\' and 0.020\'\'. The\n     following novel manufacturing methods can be used to produce cutting\n     tools with such reduced wall thicknesses.\n[0068] FIG. 11 illustrates exemplary operations for manufacturing cutting\n     tools. As shown in FIG. 11, panels can be formed with multiple teeth\n     designs and a reamer can be assembled as shown. This design and method of\n     manufacturing a spherical reamer can be faster and more efficient than\n     conventional techniques. In some embodiments, this method can be produced\n     in fewer steps, such as in nine operations. In comparison, some\n     conventional approaches of manufacturing of cutting tools can require\n     hundreds of operations to form a spherical reamer.\n[0069] As shown in FIG. 11, stamped cutting panels can be formed by\n     punching cavities in a flat sheet, forming holes for receiving bone\n     chips, and setting panel curvature and teeth height. A center support,\n     base, and dome can be formed and assembled with the panels to form a\n     single cutting tool. Thus, for example, in some embodiments, the\n     following steps can be taken:   [0070] 1. The specific tooth cutting\n     angle is punched into a flat metal blank with accuracy of\n     0.001.+-.0.0005\'\' as the first step. Angle can be set based on intended\n     cutting requirements of the bone. [0071] 2. Punch opening for bone chips\n     around tooth and create cutting edge. [0072] 3. Form spherical section\n     from the flat metal blank and elevate all teeth above spherical surface\n     with tooth elevation tolerance of .+-.0.002\'\'. Teeth are formed as\n     contours of the intended spherical surfaces as opposed to just straight\n     edges. The opening around the teeth can be further formed into funnels at\n     specific angles to direct the bone chips away from the outer surface and\n     into the hollow cavity of the cutter. [0073] 4. Multiple panels are\n     formed (3 to 8 for example) which are assembled and laser welded together\n     forming a spherical reamer.\n[0074] Using the manufacturing techniques described herein, any number of\n     teeth (e.g., 1-20 or more) can be made in a single forming step. In\n     contrast, conventional systems require multiple forming steps for each\n     individual tooth. Because the number of operations required to\n     manufacture a spherical reamer can be greatly reduced, the costs are\n     similarly reduced, thereby providing a lower cost, yet equally effective,\n     cutting tool that can be removed from clinical service at a the end of\n     its functional life without significant financial loss.\n[0075] It should be understood that the supporting structure for the\n     panels can be formed in various manners. For example, FIG. 12 illustrates\n     an alternative approach in which the panels are secured by a plastic\n     molded part.\n[0076] In some embodiments, the panels are placed directly into an\n     injection molding tool and a medical grade plastic (e.g., PEI\n     (polyetherimide, ULTEM.RTM.), PEEK (polyetheretherketone), PAI\n     (polyamidide, TORLON.RTM.) can be injected around the periphery of the\n     panels creating a frame that encloses and secures the panels. FIG. 13\n     illustrates a similar structure to that illustrated in FIG. 12; however,\n     instead of a spherical reamer, FIG. 13 depicts a cylindrical reamer.\n[0077] The cutting tools can be color coded to facilitate identification\n     of the various sizes and types of cutting tools. When the cutting tool\n     frames are formed by injection molding, such color coding can be achieved\n     by varying the color of the injection molded plastic part.\n[0078] Laboratory testing of a disclosed embodiment provided a comparison\n     to existing art spherical reamers. Bovine bone specimens were used to\n     monitor the speed to prepare a standard preparation, the temperature\n     generated during that preparation and how many preparations could be\n     completed before cutting edge damage generated a temperature exposure to\n     the bone above 50.degree. C. (122.degree. F.). FIG. 12 summarizes the\n     results of this testing and illustrates some of the improvements, such as\n     the ability to cut bone at a lower temperature for a greater number of\n     uses.\n[0079] All cutting tools will eventually wear at the cutting edges\n     resulting in a non-efficient cutter which would need to be sharpened or\n     discarded. This is true of all industries including the medical field\n     where these cutters are machining bone. In this field, the consequences\n     of the cutter becoming dull and continuing to use it can result in bone\n     necrosis. This in turn can jeopardize the success of the surgical\n     procedure as the prosthesis must be supported by live, healthy bone to\n     stabilize the implant. Excessive heat will kill the bone leading to bone\n     resorption and a less than ideal interference fit between the bone and\n     the implant. The rounding of the teeth cutting edges and damage to these\n     edges can be demonstrated after 4-6 uses of these reamers in cow bone. It\n     is for that reason all cutters should be qualified through laboratory\n     testing to define the maximum number of uses under worst-case conditions\n     which will not violate the temperature threshold for killing bone. This\n     test result can then be used as a method to identify when the cutter\n     should be removed from use.\n[0080] FIG. 14 illustrates a laboratory test set-up for determining the\n     effective functional life of a cutting tool. In these tests, acetabular\n     reamers were used to cut bone (i.e., cortical bovine bone) to determine\n     the number of uses the acetabular reamers can experience before the end\n     of their effective functional life. In one example, it was determined\n     that approximately six (6) uses of the reamer produces a complete\n     preparation without generating excessive heat (e.g., temperatures at or\n     above 122.degree. F. (50.degree. C.)).\n[0081] FIG. 14 also illustrates the results of an acetabular reamer\n     evaluation in bovine bone, including (1) a chart showing the functional\n     evaluation of a 50 mm acetabular reamer to cut bovine bone, graphing the\n     number of bone preparations (i.e., uses of the cutting tool) and the\n     temperature in the bone preparation area; and (2) a chart showing the\n     functional evaluation of a 50 mm acetabular reamer to cut bovine bone,\n     graphing the number of bone preparations (i.e., uses of the cutting tool)\n     and the time required to achieve the bone preparation. As shown in FIG.\n     14, continuing to use the cutter after the sixth use consistently\n     resulted in a longer preparation time and increased heat generation. The\n     sharpness of the teeth cutting edges are directly proportional to the\n     load required to advance the cutter, and therefore the resulting\n     friction/heat generated. As the cutting edge rounds (or dulls), it\n     becomes less effective in penetrating the surface of the bone and\n     requires additional load to attempt to advance it. This cutter wear is\n     generally consistent for all cutting tools.\n[0082] FIG. 15 illustrates exemplary cutting tools of at least some of the\n     disclosed embodiments, including a spherical reamer, long bone tapered\n     reamer, cylindrical reamer, and patellar reamer. The cutting tools and\n     methods of manufacturing the same can provide a number of improvements,\n     including (in certain embodiments) at least some of the following\n     improvements:   [0083] 1. Multiple teeth designs and teeth orientations\n     to address multiple machining needs of the bone yielding a faster, cooler\n     cut. [0084] 2. Tooth design geometries which address side cutting, end\n     cutting and a combination of both. [0085] 3. A thinner material for\n     forming the spherical reamer which can improve sharpness and reduction of\n     heat. [0086] 4. A thinner material which also provides for more efficient\n     forming of teeth and component parts improving manufacturing tool life.\n     [0087] 5. Ability to produce multiple teeth designs and multiple teeth in\n     fewer manufacturing steps. [0088] 6. A method of assembling a spherical\n     reamer using multiple panels, pre-stamped with teeth of specific geometry\n     and orientation.\n[0089] The novel approach to producing more efficient medical reamers\n     described herein can help ensure a proper bone preparation for every\n     patient. In addition, the cutting tools described herein can provide\n     improved sharpness, reduced heat during the reaming and a faster\n     preparation based on tooth geometry and orientation. These improvements\n     are also possible through a less expensive manufacturing process which\n     makes it more economical to discard the reamer when it becomes dull.\n[0090] Functional Life of Cutting Tools\n[0091] It is also desirable to understand the effective functional life of\n     the cutting tools described herein. As with any cutting tool, no matter\n     how efficient the cutter has been designed, it will dull after multiple\n     uses and its effective life will have terminated. Currently medical\n     spherical reamers are used multiple times without any monitoring of the\n     status of where the cutter is in its life cycle. Hospitals receive a new\n     spherical reamer and follow an instrument processing procedure that\n     includes cleaning, sterilizing, use, cleaning, sterilizing, and reuse.\n     However, that cycle can continue for many, many surgical procedures\n     before a surgeon notices the reamer is not cutting well.\n[0092] Cutting teeth dull after even a few uses and dull cutting teeth\n     generating heat that can be sufficient to cause bone necrosis.\n     Accordingly, in addition to improving teeth design, it can also be\n     helpful to provide the ability to indicate when a cutter should be\n     removed from use to avoid issues relating to bone necrosis from dull\n     cutters. In conventional approaches, instruments are used in hospitals on\n     patients many times without knowledge of the life expectancy of the\n     reamer and often beyond the functional life of the instrument. Some of\n     the reluctance to discard the instrument after a single use is the cost\n     of manufacturing these instruments. It is also perceived by the medical\n     industry through orthopedic surgeons that these instruments do have a\n     functional life greater than a single use. Accordingly, significant\n     improvements in manufacturing costs, such as those realized by the\n     embodiments described herein, can help to reduce the number of uses\n     needed to obtain a return on investment.\n[0093] As described above, the methods described herein can create more\n     cost effective cutting tools, such as spherical reamers. In addition, the\n     methods described herein can provide a means for defining the effective\n     functional life of the cutting tools and providing a method of knowing\n     when to discard it to ensure that the cutting tool used for any procedure\n     (e.g., a total hip procedure) will be effective for its intended purpose.\n[0094] In at least some of the embodiments described herein, as described\n     above, novel medical reamers can include at least some of the following\n     design parameters, enabling the production of more efficient tools for\n     cutting bone:   [0095] 1. Optimize forces applied to the reamer. [0096]\n     2. Thin, sharp tooth edge. [0097] 3. Specific tooth designs and tooth\n     orientations providing a faster completion of the reaming cycle. [0098]\n     4. Adequate bone chip exit path to minimize friction from the flow of the\n     chips at the cutter surface. [0099] 5. Minimize friction from cutting by\n     using thinner materials and improved tooth geometry. [0100] 6. Define the\n     functional life of the cutting edges through laboratory testing to know\n     when to discard the reamer. [0101] 7. Provide an improved and efficient\n     manufacturing process.\n[0102] Laboratory testing to confirm an improved speed of the preparation,\n     a lower cutting exposure temperature to the bone and an increased\n     functional life to the reamer.\n[0103] It should also be understood that these design principles can be\n     incorporated into other cutting tools than those described in the\n     figures, such as medical reamers that are used for patella resurfacing,\n     glenoid reaming and machining the canal of long bones.\n[0104] In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of\n     the disclosed invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the\n     illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples of the invention and\n     should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 'patent_description': u'[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No.\n     12/373,557 filed Nov. 18, 2011, entitled Patient Lifter With\n     Intraoperative Controlled Temperature Air Delivery System, which in turn\n     is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. No. 8,555,440, filed Apr. 30,\n     2008, entitled Patient Lifter With Intraoperative Controlled Temperature\n     Air Delivery System, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated in\n     their entirety by reference thereto.\n       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n[0002] 1. Field of the Invention\n[0003] The present invention relates to a patient transfer system, and\n     more particularly to a patient lifter device that also emits heated or\n     cooled air that surrounds a patient resting thereon, maintaining desired\n     body temperature during surgery.\n[0004] 2. Description of the Prior Art\n[0005] The lateral transfer of patients, especially in the operating room,\n     can be a difficult and poorly controlled procedure. Not only can the\n     patient be injured during the process, but lateral patient transfer often\n     contributes to back injuries incurred by hospital personnel, the most\n     common work-related injury to hospital workers. The development of an air\n     lifter, similar to a hovercraft, represents a significant advance in\n     handling of patients. Making the device disposable has obvious advantages\n     for sterility and cleanup. However, there is resistance in employing such\n     disposable devices for single usage because of associated costs. As a\n     result, use of disposable lateral transfer devices is generally limited\n     to special situations, such as transporting very large patients.\n[0006] Disposable intraoperative heaters are already in general use,\n     generally employing a simple heated air blower and a light plastic\n     "tent". Thermal coverings have been provided. The most common\n     alternatives are water mats, filled with heated circulating water. While\n     effective, these mats often come apart during patient transfer, causing a\n     veritable flood on the operating room floor, and necessitating\n     significant cleanup.\n[0007] Examples of various patient support systems and/or transporters are\n     set forth below.\n[0008] U.S. Pat. No. 3,449,776 to Brock discloses a collapsible\n     telescoping stretcher including a plurality of flexible straps attached\n     to the stretcher adapted to tie down the legs and torso of the patient to\n     the stretcher. An inflatable mattress rests on the stretcher and has\n     separate leg portions whereby the straps can be used to tie down the legs\n     individually. A collapsible telescoping head support is mounted on the\n     stretcher and had adjustable torso members. Straps extend through the\n     head support and torso members for immobilizing a broken neck. The\n     stretcher does not provide a patient lifter having heated/cooled air\n     released from a top chamber. Further, there is no discharge of air on the\n     bottom surface of the stretcher enabling the creation of an air cushion\n     that facilitates the lateral movement of a patient.\n[0009] U.S. Pat. No. 3,644,950 to Lindsay et al. discloses a patient\n     support system. Included with the system is a bed for supporting and\n     treating a hospital patient. A lamination of low and medium density\n     plastic foam is enclosed in a pressurized container. An open pore foam\n     layer on top of the container produces a flow of air from the top of the\n     foam layer for patient ventilation. Control of the volume of air varies\n     the degree of ventilation. The pressurizing air for the container is\n     controlled to vary the relative firmness of support. The patient support\n     of the \'950 patent provides ventilation around the patient delivered\n     through foams of different density. The ventilation air is not heated.\n     There is no discharge of air on the bottom surface of the patent support\n     system enabling the creation of an air cushion that facilitates the\n     lateral movement of a patient.\n[0010] U.S. Pat. No. 3,667,073 to Renfroe discloses a patient transporter.\n     This apparatus provides for effortless moving of a non-ambulatory patient\n     from a bed or operating table to a cart, e.g., recovery room stretcher or\n     the like and from the cart to other non-porous surfaces, e.g., X-ray\n     tables, etc. The patient transporter discharges compressed air through\n     the apertures in the bottom of an inflatable mattress to levitate the\n     mattress from an impervious stretcher or bed during lateral transport of\n     the patient. The compressed air may be discharged from apertures provided\n     on top of the inflatable mattress to essentially levitate the patient\n     with burns or severe injury by a plurality of air jets. The efficacy of\n     this system is questionable. Strong air jets may even aggravate the\n     patient\'s skin injury. While the discharge of compressed air at the\n     bottom of the inflatable mattress facilitates the lateral movement of the\n     patient, the patient transporter does not provide heated air surrounding\n     the patient.\n[0011] U.S. Pat. No. 3,740,777 to Dee discloses a bed support. This bed\n     support holds all or part of the human body and includes a chamber having\n     an upper wall at least part of which is of thin flexible sheet material,\n     e.g. rubber film, adapted when supported by gas pressure in the chamber\n     to define a trough in which the item may lie. The body support device\n     merely inflates balloons surrounding an individual body portion and the\n     balloons have apertures that discharge air towards the body part through\n     PTFE or polyethylene disks. This discharge of air through the apertures\n     and the disk separates the balloons\' external surfaces from the body part\n     by the flow of air. No air is discharged on the bottom of the body\n     support, with the result that a patient laying on the body support cannot\n     be easily transported laterally. Moreover, no heated air is discharged to\n     surround the patient and thereby provide warmth and comfort.\n[0012] U.S. Pat. No. 3,757,366 to Sacher discloses a cushion for\n     preventing and alleviating bedsores. The cushion for preventing and\n     alleviating bedsores includes a warm air delivery system which delivers\n     warm air in the close area of the cushion that contacts the skin of the\n     patient, thereby preventing direct contact between the skin and the\n     cushion and preventing or alleviating bedsores. No air is discharged\n     below the cushion since the bottom portion of the cushion is indicated to\n     be non-porous. Thus, the cushion with the patient laying there above may\n     not be easily transported laterally.\n[0013] U.S. Pat. No. 3,778,851 to Howorth discloses a mattress for use in\n     treating a patient who has undergone extensive surgery or who has been\n     severely burned. The mattress comprises an upper panel, a lower panel,\n     and means for supplying air to the space between the two panels. The\n     lower panel is made of air-impermeable material. At least a part of the\n     upper panel is perforated to allow conditioned air to issue forth and\n     pass around the patient. Since the lower portion of the mattress is\n     indicated to be impermeable, no air is delivered in the bottom of the\n     mattress. As a result, a patient lying on the mattress may not be easily\n     transported laterally.\n[0014] U.S. Pat. No. 3,822,425 to Scales discloses an inflatable support\n     appliance. The inflatable support apparatus of the \'425 patent has an air\n     impermeable base with air impermeable protrusions to which an air\n     permeable cap is mounted. A person supported by these caps receives air\n     through the apertures provided in the cap, preventing direct contact\n     between the person and the cap. No air is delivered at the bottom, since\n     the base and the protrusions are air impermeable. As a result, when a\n     patient is supported by the caps, the lateral movement of the patient is\n     very difficult, if not impractical.\n[0015] U.S. Pat. No 4,279,044 to Douglas discloses a fluid support system\n     for a medical patient. No air is delivered around the patient and no air\n     is released on the bottom of the support system. The lateral movement of\n     the patient from a stretcher to an operating system is not facilitated.\n[0016] U.S. Pat. No. 4,391,009 to Schild et al. discloses a ventilated\n     body support. This ventilated support for living bodies comprises an\n     inflatable alternating pressure pad, which is either enclosed by or forms\n     a part of an air permeable plenum chamber through which air is pumped at\n     low pressure to provide a source of ventilating air to a body resting on\n     the support. The alternating pressure pad which is inflated by a high\n     pressure pump has two sets of inter-digitized cells which are alternately\n     inflatable and deflatable and carry the weight of a body alternately, on\n     each of the two sets of cells. The disclosed ventilated body support has\n     a plurality support tubes comprising a high pressure central sealed\n     portion and a low pressure surrounding portion each pressurized by two\n     tubes with individual valves from a pump. The two portions may bleed air\n     to the environment to adjust the support character of the ventilated body\n     support. Heated air is not released to surround the patient. No air is\n     released in the bottom of the ventilated body support and a patient lying\n     on the ventilated body support may not be easily transported laterally.\n[0017] U.S. Pat. No. 5,022,110 to Stroh discloses a low air loss mattress.\n     The low air loss mattress is made of multiple cushions, which are\n     connected together and form an integral mattress which may be used on a\n     standard hospital bed. The multiple cushions allow for variable pressure\n     to support a patient and to compensate for different weights of various\n     portions of the body of the patient. Each cushion is provided with air\n     vents in its upper surface to provide air circulation around a patient\n     and for pressure regulation in each cushion. The air may be heated.\n     Retainers are provided to prevent billowing of each cushion in its center\n     portions and maintain a substantially level patient support surface. A\n     small portable blower provides a constant air supply for each of the\n     cushions and allows adjustment of the air pressure in each of the\n     cushions to accommodate varying weights of patients on the mattress. Any\n     release of air occurs only on the patient contacting surface, and the air\n     may be heated. There is no discharge of air on the bottom of the low air\n     loss mattress, which does not function as a transfer device.\n[0018] U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,560 to Uetake discloses a ventilated air\n     mattress with alternately inflatable air cells having communicating upper\n     and lower air chambers. The ventilated air mattress with alternately\n     inflatable air cells has a plurality of adjacent cells. One of the cells\n     is inflated while the adjacent cell is deflated altering the support\n     characteristic of the air mattress at a specific body contacting location\n     so that no individual part of the body has to support the bodyweight over\n     a period of time. The deflating of the cell is accomplished by opening a\n     valve and the air is not heated and is not discharged surrounding the\n     patient. No air is discharged from the bottom surface of the ventilated\n     air mattress and therefore, moving a patient lying on the air mattress\n     laterally is not assisted by an air cushion.\n[0019] U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,539 to Strell discloses a body supporting\n     device such as a mattress, box spring, cushion or car seat having an\n     inner coil spring structure. The device is provided with adjustable\n     firmness by means of a plurality of inflatable pneumatic members. The\n     pneumatic members are positioned within the interstices formed between\n     adjacent coil springs in a variety of patterns. The pneumatic members are\n     connected to an inflation control device for adjusting the firmness of\n     the body supporting device in varying modes, including a pulsation mode\n     to provide a messaging affect. No air is discharged from the top or\n     bottom surface of the body supporting device. Moving a patient lying on\n     the air mattress laterally is not assisted by an air cushion and no\n     temperature control is achieved.\n[0020] U.S. Pat. No. 5,168,589 to Stroh et al. discloses a pressure\n     reduction air mattress and overlay. This patent is a continuation in part\n     of U.S. Pat. No. 5,022,110, discussed above. Multiple cushions allow for\n     variable pressure to support a patient and to compensate for different\n     weights of various portions of the body of the patient. Each cushion is\n     provided with air vents in its upper surface to provide air circulation\n     around a patient and for pressure regulation in each cushion. The air may\n     be heated. Retainers are provided to prevent billowing of each cushion in\n     its center portions and maintain a substantially level patient support\n     surface. A small portable blower provides a constant air supply for each\n     of the cushions and allows adjustment of the air pressure in each of the\n     cushions to accommodate varying weights of patients on the mattress. Any\n     release of air occurs only on the patient contacting surface and the air\n     may be heated. There is no discharge of air on the bottom of the low air\n     loss mattress and it is not a transfer device. There is no air cushion\n     under the mattress assisting this movement.\n[0021] U.S. Pat. No. 5,249,318 to Loadsman discloses an air cushion\n     support. This air inflatable support appliance has internally sealed\n     seams, internal diaphragms and internal structural support members. The\n     air cushion support of the \'318 invention provides a flow of air between\n     the top portion of the support and the patient lying there over requiring\n     no cover or draw sheet. There is no discharge of air on the bottom of the\n     air cushion support, and this device does not aid in the lateral transfer\n     of the patient between a stretcher and an operating table.\n[0022] U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,935 to Nieh discloses a surface air\n     conditioning device including a plurality of passages through a support\n     surface which overlies a closed volume in which temperature conditioned\n     air is supplied; each passage is provided with a pressure actuated flow\n     control valve which is normally closed to prevent loss of conditioned air\n     through the associated passage; pressure contact with the valve effects\n     opening thereof to allow conditioned air to flow through the passage. The\n     top chamber includes partitions, barriers or coil springs located\n     therein. Thus, the surface air conditioning device is not readily\n     compressed to a substantially flat structure under the patient when not\n     in use and as compressed the surface air conditioning device would be\n     lumpy under the patient, causing discomfort. Moreover, the coiled spring\n     obstructions require the volume of the chamber to be increased to\n     accommodate the springs, and in turn, increased pressure is needed to\n     achieve optimum air delivery to the patient.\n[0023] U.S. Pat. No. 5,483,709 to Foster et al. discloses a low air loss\n     mattress with rigid internal bladder and lower air pallet. It is not\n     disposable, and is primarily thick mattress. This mattress has an upper\n     patient supporting low air loss bladder for ventilating and preventing\n     skin degeneration of a patient supported. It does not have any\n     temperature control feature. Unlike the submitted device, it has an\n     intermediate rigidly inflatable static bladder which must become\n     relatively rigid upon inflation to aid in transferring or weighing a\n     patient. A lower high air loss bladder is provided for reducing the\n     friction force between the mattress and the supporting surface to\n     facilitate surface-to-surface transfers. The high air loss bladder\n     includes a peripheral tube, which seals against a supporting surface to\n     contain the air, which escapes from longitudinal sacks within the tube.\n     The foot sections of the low air loss and static bladders are selectively\n     deflatable. The low air loss mattress has a low air loss bladder 12, an\n     intermediate rigidly inflatable static bladder 14 and a lower high air\n     loss bladder 18. The low air discharge bladder releases air surrounding\n     the patient, reducing patient contact with the low air loss bladder. The\n     air volume is generally small due to the small space separation between\n     the patient and the top portion of the device. An intermediate\n     pressurized rigid bladder supports the patient. The lower high air loss\n     bladder serves to create an air cushion that allows the patient on the\n     device to be moved easily. The low air loss bladder locally `floats` the\n     patient off the mattress surface. Moreover, the low air discharge air\n     bladder does not provide heated air and does not have sufficient air\n     delivery capacity to surround the area around the patient with warm air.\n[0024] U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,873 to Weedling discloses an air chamber-type\n     patient mover air pallet with multiple control features. The air\n     chamber-type patient mover air pallet does not have separate upper and\n     lower chambers disconnected from each other, the first chamber providing\n     controlled heated or cooled air surrounding the patient for temperature\n     control while a second separated chamber having adequate air flow\n     provides an air cushion for easy transverse movement of a patient.\n[0025] U.S. Pat. No. 5,590,428 to Roter discloses an air pressurized\n     person supporting device with ventilation. The upper wall is formed with\n     a plurality of openings at spaced locations receiving a plurality of\n     valve members. Valves in the supporting device seal off everywhere except\n     where the person applies pressure, providing ventilation of air. Since no\n     air is released under the support device, there is no air cushion, and\n     the device does not function to lift or transport. Further, the device\n     does not provide heated air surrounding the patient.\n[0026] U.S. Pat. No. 5,652,987 to Fujita discloses a decubitus ulcer\n     prevention device. This decubitus ulcer prevention device comprises an\n     air generator with a fan and an air mattress for receiving air from the\n     air generator. Air is discharged at a surface through minute air\n     discharge holes. Along a flow path of the air that passes through the fan\n     are located, in order as named, a heater and an alkaline chlorine dioxide\n     gas generator, in which is internally provided a ceramic body that is\n     impregnated with an alkaline chlorine dioxide solution. Air that is\n     heated, by passing through the heater, is brought into contact with the\n     ceramic body, so that air that includes alkaline chlorine dioxide gas is\n     thus supplied to the air mattress. The decubitus ulcer prevention device\n     delivers heated air or ambient air treated with chlorine dioxide through\n     fine apertures on the skin contacting surface of an air mattress. This\n     complex system is not a transfer device; air is not delivered on the\n     underside of the air mattress and the air mattress with the supported\n     patient may not be easily displaced in a transverse direction. The device\n     is not designed to be disposable.\n[0027] U.S. Pat. No. 5,781,943 to Moenning et al. discloses a medical\n     table and method for moving a patient from a first position to a second\n     position. This medical table includes a base. The medical table with\n     roller support uses a motor to rotate the rollers to change the position\n     of the patient. No air is delivered on the bottom surface of the medical\n     table. The lateral movement of the patient is not accomplished by the\n     movement of an air mattress. Instead, the patient is driven by rollers\n     and a belt under the patient, and has to be assisted by medical personnel\n     for proper placement. Once the patient leaves this medical table, the\n     patient has to be moved manually, causing hardship to the patient.\n[0028] U.S. Pat. No. 6,073,291 to Davis discloses an improved inflatable\n     medical patient transfer apparatus having a combination of transverse\n     partition members and a raised perimeter section that reduces deleterious\n     ballooning and uneven inflation as well as quick emergency deflation and\n     provides additional security for a patient supported upon such transfer\n     apparatus. Additional differentially inflatable patient rolling chambers\n     are preferably supplied on the top of the transfer apparatus to provide\n     assistance to medical personnel in beginning to roll patients reclining\n     or lying upon the transfer apparatus, particularly in a deflated\n     condition on a hospital bed. An improved air inlet arrangement is also\n     provided along with certain indicia upon the surface of the transfer\n     apparatus to expedite use by hospital personnel. The inflatable apparatus\n     includes a top chamber having a raised peripheral chamber containing\n     partition members, and the inside of the chamber includes partition\n     members. As a result, the surface is not flat and the inner partition\n     members result in a device that is cumbersome and bulky when compressed,\n     causing discomfort to the patient. The raised peripheral chamber and\n     partition members result in greater volume in the chamber, in turn\n     causing greater air flow to be needed.\n[0029] U.S. Pat. No. 6,065,166 to Sharrock discloses a support cushion for\n     a person in a lateral decubitus position, comprising a base, two lateral\n     structural supports, and a central concavity. The lateral supports are\n     sufficiently stiff to resist rolling of the person, while the central\n     concavity distributes the weight of the person. The device is a holder--a\n     support cushion designed to hold the patient still while the patient is\n     on the operating table. It is not designed for or applicable to patient\n     transfer, and does not involve a heating or temperature control element.\n[0030] U.S. Pat. No. 6,546,576 to Lin discloses structure of a ventilated\n     mattress with cooling and warming effect. This structure of a ventilated\n     mattress with cooling and warming effect comprises a mattress body, a\n     warming/cooling air-delivery controlling box, and a connecting tube. The\n     control box produces warming/cooling air to the mattress body via the\n     connecting tube and the warming/cooling air is released via a plurality\n     of ventilation buttons mounted at the surface of the mattress body.\n     Thereby, the mattress provides the user with a warming/cooling effect.\n     The mattress is not an air mattress, but has conventional springs to\n     support a patient positioned on the mattress. No air is delivered at the\n     bottom surface of the mattress. Due to the absence of an air cushion at\n     the bottom surface of the mattress, a patient lying on the mattress may\n     not be laterally moved with ease.\n[0031] U.S. Pat. No. 7,090,692 to Augustine et al. discloses a thermal\n     blanket. The blanket lies above the patient, rather than below. This\n     thermal blanket includes an inflatable covering with a head end, a foot\n     end, two edges and an undersurface. The covering is inflated through an\n     inlet at the foot end by a thermally-controlled inflating medium. An\n     aperture array on the undersurface of the covering exhausts the\n     thermally-controlled inflating medium from the covering. When inflated,\n     the thermal blanket self-erects and provides a bath of\n     thermally-controlled inflating medium to the interior of the erected\n     structure. The blanket has an aperture free top surface and a side facing\n     the patient is provided with a plurality of apertures to discharge warm\n     air that is supplied to the blanket. Furthermore, nothing in the device\n     facilitates lateral movement of the patient; it is not a transfer device.\n[0032] U.S. Pat. No. 7,114,204 to Patrick discloses a method and apparatus\n     for transferring patients. This patient transfer apparatus includes an\n     inflatable mattress, alternatively having a rigid top board with a\n     patient restraint system on which a patient can be placed, when patient\n     immobilization is required. A portable cart is included with a chamber\n     for storage of a plurality of mattresses. The cart also has a gas/air\n     blower and power supply system for empowering the blower. Pressurized air\n     is supplied to a single chamber of an air mattress, which discharges the\n     air through the underside of the mattress, and not independently into an\n     upper or lower chamber. While this passage of air creates an air cushion\n     under the mattress, permitting lateral displacement of the patient, there\n     is no indication that the pressure of supplied air is regulated. No warm\n     air is delivered to the patient positioned on the upper surface of the\n     mattress device, and patient temperature is not controlled.\n[0033] U.S. Pat. No. 7,627,910 to Davis discloses a transfer mattress\n     including an upper mattress having three longitudinally oriented plenums\n     and three separate inlet/outlet valves that are each arranged in airflow\n     communication with their respective plenum. First and second of the\n     plenums are arranged in airflow communication with one another while a\n     central plenum is arranged in airflow isolation from the first plenum and\n     the second plenum so that the first and second plenums may be inflated\n     and deflated independently of the central plenum. A lower inflatable\n     mattress is separated by a common wall from the upper mattress. A lower\n     inlet/outlet valve is arranged in airflow communication with a lower\n     plenum defined by the lower inflatable mattress. A bottom wall defines a\n     plurality of perforations so that when the lower plenum is charged with\n     pressurized air, it escapes under pressure through the perforations to\n     create an air bearing under the mattress. A method for transporting a\n     patient in comfort is also provided by the invention. The inflatable\n     apparatus includes a top chamber having raised peripheral chamber\n     containing partition members, and the inside of the chamber includes\n     partition members. As a result, the surface is not flat and the inner\n     partition members result in a device that is cumbersome and bulky when\n     compressed, causing discomfort to the patient. The raised peripheral\n     chamber and partition members result in greater volume in the chamber, in\n     turn causing greater air flow to be needed.\n[0034] U.S. Pat. No. 7,278,179 to Schneider describes an inflatable mat\n     with vent structures controlled by heat sensors. It is used to treat skin\n     breakdown. It is not a transfer device and no air is expelled from the\n     lower surface. Heat serves only to change the chemical structure of the\n     upper surface to allow air to circulate to the skin. The device is not\n     used in an operating room or designed to maintain body temperature.\n[0035] U.S. Pat. No. 7,565,709 to Davis discloses a double chambered\n     transfer mattress capable of partial deflation, and which includes a top\n     inflatable mattress and a bottom inflatable mattress that are separated\n     by a common wall from one another. A selectable inlet/outlet valve is\n     arranged for airflow communication between an interior chamber of the\n     bottom inflatable mattress and a source of pressurized air. A one-way\n     valve is positioned through the common wall so as to provide selective\n     air flow communication between the top inflatable mattress and the bottom\n     inflatable mattress. When the inlet/outlet valve is closed, air continues\n     to escape from perforations in the bottom inflatable mattress, and the\n     one-way valve is actuated so as to prevent deflation of the top\n     inflatable mattress. The inflatable apparatus includes a top chamber\n     having raised peripheral chamber containing partition members, and the\n     inside of the chamber includes partition members. As a result, the\n     surface is not flat and the inner partition members result in a device\n     that is cumbersome and bulky when compressed, causing discomfort to the\n     patient. The raised peripheral chamber and partition members result in\n     greater volume in the chamber, in turn causing greater air flow to be\n     needed.\n[0036] U.S. Pat. No. 7,735,164 to Patrick discloses a disposable patient\n     transfer mattress including a rectangular top sheet, a rectangular bottom\n     sheet, internal baffles, and a receptacle configured to receive a\n     connector for supplying air to inflate the mattress. The bottom sheet\n     corresponds to the top sheet, and the periphery of the bottom sheet is\n     joined to the periphery of the top sheet. The internal baffles extend\n     between the top sheet and the bottom sheet. Each baffle is a rectangular\n     sheet with first and second parallel edges, and each baffle is joined to\n     the top sheet along the first edge and to the bottom sheet along the\n     second edge. The bottom sheet has a plurality of holes configured to\n     provide a continuous cushion of air under the mattress when the mattress\n     is inflated. The top sheet, bottom sheet, and internal baffles are made\n     of fabric backed with a thermally weldable material, where the thermally\n     weldable material faces the interior of the mattress for facilitating\n     thermal welding of the baffles to the top surface and the bottom surface.\n     Pressurized air is supplied to a single chamber of an air mattress, which\n     discharges the air through the underside of the mattress, and not\n     independently into an upper or lower chamber. While this passage of air\n     creates an air cushion under the mattress, permitting lateral\n     displacement of the patient, there is no indication that the pressure of\n     supplied air is regulated. No warm air is delivered to the patient\n     positioned on the upper surface of the mattress device, and patient\n     temperature is not controlled.\n[0037] U.S. Pat. No. 7,914,611 to Vrzalik discloses a support system\n     including a multi-layer cover sheet with a number of layers. In certain\n     embodiments, a source to move air inside and outside the multi-layer\n     cover sheet can be provided. The source can include a source of positive\n     pressure or negative pressure. The mattress is not a transfer device,\n     does not have air vents below or above, and has no temperature regulating\n     action.\n[0038] U.S. Pub. Pat. App. No. 2008/0000030 to Wang discloses an\n     inflatable mattress designed for more than one body to be supported on\n     its surface. The mattress is not a transfer device, does not have air\n     vents below or above, and has no temperature regulating action.\n[0039] U.S. Pub. Pat. App. No. 2009/0320211 to Lau discloses an inflatable\n     bed assembly having a plurality of inflatable cushion cells disposed on\n     the top of the inflatable bed. Each cushion cell has a vent fluidly\n     interconnecting the interior volume of the cushion cell with a main air\n     chamber of the bed. When the bed is inflated, the cushion cells inflate\n     and form raised projections on the top of the bed. The cushion cells\n     provide a pressure sensitive surface which molds to the user\'s body for\n     increased comfort. The vents are sized to allow the cushion cells to\n     inflate upon inflation of the main air chamber, partially deflate when\n     pressure is applied, and re-inflate when the pressure is removed. The\n     size of the vents dampens the rate that air passes through the vent. The\n     controlled inflation and deflation of the cells softens the impact caused\n     by application of a body thereon and simulates the dampened response of\n     "memory-foam".

There is no air provided on the bottom\n     surface of the mat forming an air cushion. The mat is not laterally slid.\n     Instead, the patient is slid by an attendant. No warm air surrounds the\n     patient.\n[0044] None of the devices described hereinabove teaches or discloses a\n     dual function patient lifter with temperature control. temperature\n     control devices described are associated with heavy mattresses. The thick\n     supporting structures are designed for longer term or continuous usage,\n     and not for the short term, transient application of patient transfer.\n     Further, none of the devices provides an inter-operative pad that\n     delivers filtered clean air to surround the patient. Most of the devices\n     are not practical for single usage and disposal.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n[0045] The present invention provides a system and method to lift and\n     laterally transfer a patient that also delivers temperature-controlled\n     air intraoperatively from below the patient, maintaining body temperature\n     during surgery. The lifter/transfer portion of the device (bottom\n     chamber) is only inflated briefly to achieve transfer of the patient and\n     is otherwise collapsed; it is not a static mattress. The ambient air\n     bottom chamber of the patient lifter is inflatable for use to transfer\n     the patient to a different support structure, such as a mattress,\n     stretcher, or other surface.\n[0046] It has been surprisingly and unexpectedly found that a single pad\n     can be constructed to deliver clean filtered warm air from below a\n     patient without the need of a tent structure; yet, at the same time, be\n     appointed to deliver ambient air to a bottom chamber for easy movement of\n     the pad when transferring the patient. None of the currently disclosed or\n     utilized devices provides an intra-operative heater providing clean\n     filtered air around a patient that incorporates a lifter/transfer\n     mechanism that moves a patient on and off the operating table without\n     excessive force and effort, avoiding pain for the patient and possible\n     injury to operating room personnel. It has also been found that lateral\n     transfer conducted with minimal tilt of the patient, reducing rolling and\n     pulling, reduces the risk of disruption of operative repair and\n     dislocation of prosthesis.\n[0047] Moreover, most current devices that provide warm air delivery do so\n     by means of a tent apparatus that blows air up over a patient. These tent\n     devices are large and bulky and when inflated sometimes interfere with\n     access to the patient. The use of the tents can be avoided by using the\n     subject patient lifter/heater, where apertures on the top surface of the\n     top chamber deliver warm/cooled air effectively from below the patient. A\n     blanket or surgical drape that is normally placed over the patient and\n     pad entraps the warm/cooled air. Other current devices that attempt to\n     provide warmth from below the patient are typically water blankets that\n     heat below a patient. These water blankets frequently rupture and flood\n     the operating table and floor. The need for water blankets also can be\n     avoided with use of the patient lifter/heater. It has been found that the\n     air surrounding the patient is susceptible to carrying airborne bacteria.\n     As a result, it has been determined that the bacteria in the air can\n     cause infection.\n[0048] It has been surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the usefulness\n     of the lifter is significantly improved by combining it with an\n     intraoperative heater. The intraoperative heater is also improved when it\n     is combined with a patient lifter/transfer device. The use of a single\n     device saves time, space, and cost and avoids the possible transfer of\n     bacteria, fluids or organic material from one patient to another via a\n     non-disposable (i.e., re-used) pad. The air flowing in and out of the\n     upper chamber is regulated according to pressure and temperature, and it\n     is generally delivered at low pressure. Moreover, the air in the upper\n     chamber is preferably filtered to prevent bacteria from being blown in\n     the air circulating around the patient and help maintain sterility and\n     avoid infection. A more powerful blower is then provided to push the air\n     through a bacterial filter in the upper chamber. The "ambient" air\n     provided to the lower chamber does not need to be filtered, as it doesn\'t\n     circulate around the patient during the surgical procedure and it is\n     normally supplied at high pressure to create the air cushion during\n     transfer.\n[0049] The system of the present invention comprises a combination heater\n     and transfer device, consisting of a mat with a bottom surface and a top\n     surface, a heated air top compartment, and an ambient air bottom chamber\n     separated by a diaphragm. The top surface has a plurality of apertures.\n     The heated air top chamber has an inlet aperture attached to a hose.\n     Heated air travels through the heated air chamber. Apertures on the top\n     surface of the pad deliver heated air from below a patient resting on the\n     top surface of the pad. A surgical drape above the patient contains that\n     warm air and maintains body temperature without the need of a cumbersome\n     tent or water blanket. The lifter/transfer portion of the device (bottom\n     chamber) is only inflated briefly to achieve transfer of the patient and\n     is otherwise collapsed. It is not a static mattress. The device\'s ambient\n     air bottom chamber is inflated for use when a patient requires transfer\n     to a different support structure, such as a stretcher or hospital bed.\n     The ambient air bottom chamber is constructed with small holes in the\n     bottom surface to allow air to exit, creating an air cushion that\n     slightly levitates the pad above the underlying surface. This facilitates\n     transfer of the patient from the stretcher to an operating table. When\n     the patient needs to be moved laterally, the air pressure in the bottom\n     chamber is increased to a level whereby air leaks from the apertures in\n     the bottom surface of the device. An air cushion is thereby created,\n     substantially decreasing the friction for lateral displacement of the\n     device on which the patient rests, so that even a heavy patient may be\n     moved with minimal effort by a single person. Advantageously, with this\n     arrangement hospital personnel are spared the difficult work of lifting\n     and sliding the patient, and the frequent back strains that result from\n     this activity.\n[0050] Advantageously, the lifter/heater device performs all of its\n     functions using a single blower/motor with variable (high/low) air output\n     and a heater that is switched on or off High pressure/volume air flow\n     without heat in the lower chamber is used for the transfer function and\n     low pressure with heated (or potentially cooled) air in the upper chamber\n     maintains correct patient temperature. The dual functions of the air\n     blower save space in the operating room or other location and reduce cost\n     because only one machine is needed for two different functions.\n[0051] In operation, the patient rests on the device, which has been\n     placed on a bed or stretcher. When the patient is to be transferred to\n     another support structure, operating table or the like,\n     pressure-regulated compressed air is delivered to the bottom chamber of\n     the pad. The air escapes from apertures provided on the bottom surface,\n     allowing the pad and the patient to be lifted and transferred easily onto\n     a separate structure.\n[0052] In a further embodiment of the invention, the lower chamber of the\n     pad includes at least two inter-digitizing inflatable chambers that\n     extend along the length of the pad. Ambient air is delivered into the\n     bottom compartment and the two inter-digitizing inflatable chambers.\n     These inter-digitizing inflatable chambers allow the device to serve as\n     an alternating pressure pad. Each of the two individual inter-digitizing\n     inflatable chambers is pressurized alternately by the regulated air\n     pressure which can be channeled by a valve into one of the two chambers.\n     Air pressure within these sections is alternately increased and\n     decreased, changing the points of contact between the patient\'s skin and\n     the top surface of the pad and thereby reliving pressure on sores or skin\n     injury locations.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n[0053] The invention will be more fully understood and further advantages\n     will become apparent when reference is had to the following detailed\n     description of the preferred embodiments and the accompanying drawings,\n     in which:\n[0054] FIG. 1a illustrates an air mattress for patients of the type\n     disclosed by the prior art;\n[0055] FIG. 1b illustrates an air mattress for patients of the type\n     disclosed by the prior art;\n[0056] FIG. 2a illustrates a first embodiment of the subject invention;\n[0057] FIG. 2b illustrates a blower appointed to be utilized with the\n     subject invention to provide heated/cooled air and ambient air to the top\n     and bottom chambers, respectively;\n[0058] FIG. 2c illustrates detail of the hose attachment of the blower to\n     the top and bottom chambers;\n[0059] FIG. 2d illustrates a cross-section view of the embodiment of FIG.\n     2a taken along V-V;\n[0060] FIG. 2e illustrates a view of the blower attached to an alternate\n     hose attachment having a diverter valve;\n[0061] FIG. 3 illustrates another embodiment of the subject invention,\n     wherein the pad\'s top and bottom chambers include perforation channels\n     contiguously there through for fluid drainage;\n[0062] FIG. 4 illustrates another embodiment of the subject invention,\n     wherein the top, bottom and/or both chambers are ridged and/or contain\n     baffles to enhance dimensional stability to the device;\n[0063] FIG. 5a illustrates a first embodiment of the subject invention;\n[0064] FIG. 5b illustrates a cross-section view of the embodiment of FIG.\n     5a;\n[0065] FIG. 6a illustrates an alternative embodiment of the subject\n     invention; and\n[0066] FIG. 6b illustrates a cross-section view of the embodiment of FIG.\n     6a.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n[0067] Patients are oftentimes required to be transported from a hospital\n     bed to an X-ray, CT or MRI facility for laboratory tests. A patient may\n     also be required to be transported from the hospital bed or stretcher to\n     an operating table. Patients often have painful limbs or fractures, and\n     any movement of the patient may result in extreme discomfort. Further,\n     patients with high body weight are generally more difficult to move, and\n     the lateral transfer of a patient can injure the patient and cause back\n     injuries to the hospital staff Recent development of airlift mattresses,\n     as for example those marketed by AirMatt, AirPal or HoverMatt have\n     produced air mattresses with air cushion-forming apertures thereunder.\n     These air-cushion forming apertures enable a patient positioned on the\n     mattress to be laterally displaced on or off a flat or irregular surface\n     with minimal effort. The patient may be laterally moved from a hospital\n     bed to a stretcher, or from a stretcher to an x-ray table or an operating\n     table with ease. However, these airlift mattresses do not surround the\n     patient with controlled temperature airflow. As a result, the patient\n     requires the use of another device to maintain body temperature during\n     anaesthesia. Conventional methods for ambient temperature control\n     surrounding the patient generally require use of tents that are bulky and\n     at times awkward. Water blankets are effective, but often rupture or\n     leak. However, it has been determined that the surrounding air can cause\n     bacterial infections in patients.\n[0068] It has been surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the usefulness\n     of the lifter is significantly improved by combining it with an\n     intraoperative heater. The intraoperative heater is also improved when it\n     is combined with a patient lifter/transfer device. The use of a single\n     device saves time, space, and cost and avoids the possible transfer of\n     bacteria, fluids or organic material from one patient to another via a\n     non-disposable (i.e., re-used) pad. The air flowing in and out of the\n     upper chamber is regulated according to pressure and temperature, and it\n     is generally delivered at low pressure. Moreover, the air in the upper\n     chamber is preferably filtered to prevent bacteria from being blown in\n     the air circulating around the patient and help maintain sterility and\n     avoid infection. A more powerful blower is then provided to push the air\n     through a bacterial filter in the upper chamber. The "ambient" air\n     provided to the lower chamber does not need to be filtered, as it doesn\'t\n     circulate around the patient during the surgical procedure and it is\n     normally supplied at high pressure to create the air cushion during\n     transfer.\n[0069] The subject patient lifter includes an upper chamber wherein air is\n     introduced into the patient lifter. A filter is integrated within the\n     patient lifter to remove air-borne infectious disease. Preferably, a more\n     powerful blower is utilized with the patient lifter because the filter\n     would impose additional drag on the air stream. Advantageously, the\n     filter eliminates bacteria from the heated or cooled air that is\n     circulated around the patient. By eliminating bacteria from the air the\n     chance of infection related to the device is significantly reduced.\n     Placement of the filter is on the inside surface of the attachment piece\n     for the upper chamber so that the filter is fully disposable in that\n     location and doesn\'t require cleaning or periodic replacing. Further, the\n     positioning of the filter in the upper chamber is also desirable because\n     it functions only in a low airflow situation, making it less likely to\n     blow out or burst when air flows through it. As the air flow in the lower\n     compartment is not obstructed, it also reduces the power that the pump\n     must deliver to achieve the high flow that is necessary when the patient\n     is being lifted and transported.\n[0070] FIGS. 1a and 1b depict a prior art inflatable air mattress\n     disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 7,114,204 to Patrick, which is laterally moved\n     on an air jet cushion. This device is in contrast with the products\n     marketed by AirMatt, AirPal or HoverMatt where the air jets are directly\n     below the patient and the patient generally `floats` on air, allowing\n     easy displacement. FIG. 1a illustrates an integrated patient transfer\n     system including an inflatable air mattress assembled on a stretcher 12\n     (FIG. 8 of the Patrick patent). The air cushion and supply cart according\n     to Patrick is illustrated in FIG. 1b (FIG. 3 of the Patrick patent). The\n     air mattress 22 is constructed with a plurality of small holes in the\n     bottom surface 48 through which gas exits from inside the mattress 22,\n     thereby creating an air cushion for levitating the air mattress.\n[0071] FIG. 2a illustrates at 2000 a first embodiment of the subject\n     invention. FIG. 2d illustrates a cross-section view taken along line V-V\n     of FIG. 2a. Pad 2101 generally is a thin flexible matt construct provided\n     with a top chamber 2120 and a bottom chamber 2121. Preferably, handles\n     2150 are provided at the foot and head region of the pad. Alternatively,\n     the handles 2150 may also/or instead, be located on the sides of the pad.\n     Pad 2101 includes a bottom surface 2102, a top surface 2103, and a\n     separation barrier 2104 between and completely separating the top chamber\n     2120 and 2121. Barrier 2104 is preferably a diaphragm composed of a\n     semi-flexible thin impervious material, such as a polymeric or silicone\n     film or material. Top surface 2103 is provided with apertures 2105a and\n     2105b therein. Generally, apertures 2105a, located near the head portion\n     of the pad 2101, may be larger than apertures 2105b located at the foot\n     portion of pad 2101, and deliver an increased amount of comfort air to\n     the upper portion of the body. The apertures 2105a and 2105b may be\n     selected to be of equal size without departing from the scope of the\n     invention. Low pressure compressed heated or cooled air is supplied to\n     the top chamber 2120 through a hose attached to inlet 2106 by way of\n     mating attachment means 2106\' (see FIGS. 2b, 2c and 2e for embodiments\n     relating to the hose/mating attachment means). A filter 2107 is\n     integrated within mating attachment means 2106\' and/or within inlet 2106\n     so that the air inflow (low flow heated/cooled) to the top chamber 2120\n     is filtered to remove bacteria and contaminants that can cause infection.\n     The filter 2107 is attached to the back (inside/interior facing) part of\n     the mating attachment means 2106\' (see FIG. 2c). Filter 2107 cleans air\n     so that clean air without bacteria is passed through the top chamber 2120\n     and released around the patient, minimizing infection risk. Filtered\n     heated or cooled air travels through the top chamber 2120 and is\n     delivered through the apertures 2105a and 2105b, to surround and provide\n     comfort and clean air to a patient resting on the pad. Air is supplied\n     from below the patient to provide optimal temperature maintenance during\n     surgery while mitigating the risk of infection.\n[0072] Pad 2101 functions as an air lift pad wherein the bottom chamber\n     2121 is pressurized by ambient compressed air delivered at a pre-selected\n     regulated pressure through inlet aperture 2110 through a hose attached to\n     the inlet aperture 2110 by way of mating attachment means 2110\' (see\n     FIGS. 2b and 2c for embodiments relating to the mating attachment means).\n[0073] The bottom surface of the bottom chamber is provided with a\n     plurality of apertures 2108 through which the regulated pressure\n     compressed air delivered through aperture 2110 may leak. When transfer or\n     lifting of the patient is not required, air delivery to the bottom\n     chamber is generally in a low or off position, so that the bottom chamber\n     is essentially flat or un-inflated. When it is time to initiate lifting\n     or transfer of the patient, air delivery to the bottom chamber is\n     increased or turned on so that regulated pressure of compressed air is\n     delivered into the bottom chamber and flows from the apertures 2108,\n     functioning to create an air pocket under the bottom surface 2102 of the\n     pad and facilitating lifting or transfer of the patient and pad onto\n     another surface. Regulated compressed air pressure is increased to a high\n     value, and air leaks through the apertures 2108 creating an air cushion\n     between the bottom surface 2102 of the pad and an underlying flat or\n     uneven surface, such as a bed, stretcher or an operating table.\n[0074] This air cushion essentially levitates the pad with the patient\n     slightly above the flat or uneven surface, whereby the patient may be\n     laterally displaced with minimal effort. Using this procedure, the\n     patient is easily displaced laterally with minimal effort for example,\n     from a bed to a stretcher or a stretcher to an operating table or any\n     combination thereof. When the patient is moved to a desired location, the\n     compressed air pressure may be brought to substantially zero or very low\n     so that the bottom chamber is substantially flat or un-inflated.\n[0075] Preferably, both the top chamber 2120 and the bottom chamber 2121\n     have shallow depths 2120\', 2121\' as best indicated by way of FIG. 2d. The\n     depth 2121\' of the bottom chamber 2121 preferably ranges from about 1/2\n     inch to about 3 inches. Owing to the shallow depth 2121\' of the bottom\n     chamber 2121, at least two advantages have been found to result. First,\n     less air is needed to initiate air leakage through apertures 2108 when\n     creating the air cushion and the air cushion is created at a more rapid\n     rate than would occur with a less shallow chamber. Second, when flat or\n     collapsed the bottom chamber does not cause any type of discomfort to a\n     patient resting on the pad. The shallow chamber 2121 virtually eliminates\n     formation of excess material which could cause bunching and create an\n     uncomfortable mass under the patient\'s body when the chamber is flat.\n     Preferably, the depth 2120\' of the top chamber 2120 ranges from about 1/2\n     inch to about 3 inches. Further advantages are derived from a shallow top\n     chamber. Less air is needed to initiate and maintain the desired air flow\n     regulation of the heated/or cooled air. The structure facilitates faster\n     inflation and air distribution delivery to the patient.\n[0076] The subject pad is light, flexible and easily stored. It is\n     fabricated from nonwoven material and is intended to be single use\n     disposable. This reduces the risk of infection and avoids the cost and\n     time required for cleaning. Because the device performs two functions\n     that presently require separate devices and air blowers, it saves space\n     and reduces both costs and complexity in the operating room. The same\n     heater pad can also be used after a patient leaves the operating room but\n     still requires warming to maintain body temperature.\n[0077] FIG. 2b illustrates a blower shown at 2200 that is appointed to be\n     utilized with the pad to provide heated/cooled air and ambient air to the\n     top and bottom chambers, respectively. Generally, blower 2200 includes a\n     main body housing 2201 removably attached to at least one hose 2202 which\n     in turn includes an attachment fixture 2203 that is appointed to be\n     attached to the mating attachments 2106\' and 2110\' of the top and bottom\n     chamber inlets 2106, 2110, respectively. The hose allows the blower to\n     supply air to both the top and bottom chambers when needed (such as\n     during heated/cooled air delivery via the top chamber, and lateral\n     transfer via the bottom chamber). Generally, the blower 2200 includes low\n     and high air regulator controls 2210, 2211 as well as heater/cool air\n     controls 2212 and ambient air controls 2213. Blower 2200 may be placed on\n     a rolling cart with storage capacity for lifter/heater pads as well.\n     Advantageously, the blower 2200 performs two functions in a single unit\n     device, thus saving space and reducing costs in the operating room.\n[0078] FIG. 2e illustrates a view of the blower attached to an alternate\n     hose attachment having a diverter valve. Blower 2200 is attached to a\n     hose portion 2202\' that is attached to a diverter valve 2900. Diverter\n     valve 2900 is attached to a first hose 2202a and a second hose 2202b each\n     having attachment fixtures 2203a\' and 2203b\', respectively. Attachment\n     fixtures 2203a\' and 2203b\' are constructed as discussed hereinabove. In\n     this manner, the diverter valve 2900 can be adjusted to divert air either\n     to the first or second hose 2202a, 2202b as desired.\n[0079] FIG. 2c illustrates detail of the hose attachment of the blower to\n     the top and bottom chambers. Blower 2200 attachment fixture 2203 is\n     appointed to mating attach to mating attachments 2106\' and 2110\' of the\n     top and bottom chamber\'s inlets 2106, 2110, respectively. Air is supplied\n     to the top or bottom chambers through a hose that is connected with a\n     mating attachment fitting preferably of the type shown in the FIG. 2c.\n     Preferably, the hose 2202 terminates at the attachment fixture 2203,\n     which is a bayonet-type fitting that engages the mating fittings 2106\',\n     2110\' of the pad. The hose is locked into position by a twisting\n     operation. More specifically, the hose 2202 from the blower terminates in\n     a male fitting 2261 at the end of hard plastic or rubber tube 2260.\n     Fitting 2261 engages a complementary female fitting 2270, also made of\n     hard plastic or rubber, integrated within mating fittings 2106\', 2110\' of\n     the pad attached to the respective mattress/pad chamber. Fitting 2270 has\n     an inward facing channel 2271 between perforated baseplate 2272 and three\n     teeth. Male fitting 2261 also has three teeth, each with an outward\n     facing channel 2262 that mates with fitting 2270. The thickness of the\n     tooth portion outside the channel is tapered circumferentially, so that\n     the fittings can be engaged and locked by inserting fitting 2261 into\n     fitting 2271 and rotating it into locked position. Filter 2107 is\n     integrated within mating attachment means 2106\' so that the air inflow\n     (low flow heated/cooled) to the top chamber 2120 is filtered to remove\n     bacteria from air that surrounds the patient. The filter 2107 is attached\n     to the back (inside/interior facing) part of the mating attachment means\n     2106\' (see FIG. 2c). Filter 2107 cleans air so that clean air without\n     bacteria is passed through the top chamber 2120 and released around the\n     patient, minimizing infection risk. Filtered heated or cooled air travels\n     through the top chamber 2120 and is delivered through the apertures 2105a\n     and 2105b, to surround and provide comfort and clean air to a patient\n     resting on the pad. Air is supplied from below the patient to provide\n     optimal temperature maintenance during surgery while mitigating the risk\n     of infection.\n[0080] FIG. 3 illustrates another embodiment of the subject invention,\n     shown generally at 3000. Pad 3101 is generally constructed as set forth\n     hereinabove with respect to the discussion of FIG. 2a. However, in the\n     embodiment herein shown, pad 3101 includes perforation channels 3080\n     contiguously through the top chamber 3120, separation barrier 3104 and\n     bottom chamber 3121. Perforation channels 3080 are constructed having a\n     proximate aperture 3081, channel walls 3082, and a distal aperture 3083,\n     each open to the atmosphere and being appointed to allow fluid drainage.\n     A filter 3107 is integrated within mating attachment means 3106\' within\n     inlet 3106 so that the air inflow (low flow heated/cooled) to the top\n     chamber 3120 is filtered to remove bacteria and contaminants that can\n     cause infection. Filter 3107 cleans air so that clean air without\n     bacteria is passed through the top chamber 3120 and released around the\n     patient, minimizing infection risk.\n[0081] FIG. 4 illustrates another embodiment of the subject invention,\n     wherein the top, bottom and/or both chambers are ridged and/or contain\n     baffles therein 4030 to enhance dimensional stability to the device.\n     Preferably baffles 4030 are interconnected to one another such as in an\n     alternating manner at 4031, and/or 4032, respectively between the\n     baffles. A filter 4107 is integrated within mating attachment means 4106\'\n     within inlet 4106 so that the air inflow (low flow heated/cooled) to the\n     top chamber 4120 is filtered to remove bacteria and contaminants that can\n     cause infection. Filter 4107 cleans air so that clean air without\n     bacteria is passed through the top chamber 4120 and released around the\n     patient, minimizing infection risk.\n[0082] FIG. 5a illustrates at 200 a first embodiment of the subject\n     invention. FIG. 5b illustrates a cross-section view taken along line X-X\n     of FIG. 5a. Pad 101 generally is provided with a top chamber 120 and a\n     bottom chamber 121. Pad 101 includes a bottom surface 102, a top surface\n     103, and a separation barrier 104 between the top chamber 120 and 121.\n     Barrier 104 is preferably a diaphragm composed of a semi-flexible thin\n     impervious material, such as a polymeric or silicone film or material.\n     Top surface 103 is provided with apertures 105a and 105b therein.\n     Generally, apertures 105a, located near the head portion of the pad 101,\n     are larger than apertures 105b located at the foot portion of pad 101,\n     and deliver an increased amount of comfort air to the upper portion of\n     the body. The apertures 105a and 105b may be selected to be of equal size\n     without departing from the scope of the invention. Low pressure\n     compressed heated or cooled air is supply to the top chamber 120 through\n     a hose attached to inlet 106. P indicates a pressure source and the\n     circle with an arrow indicates a regulator. The heated or cooled air\n     travels through the top chamber 120 and is delivered through the\n     apertures 105a and 105b, to surround and provide comfort to a patient\n     resting on the pad. Air is supplied from below the patient to provide\n     optimal temperature control. Pad 101 functions as an air lift pad wherein\n     the bottom chamber 121 is pressurized by ambient compressed air delivered\n     at a pre-selected regulated pressure through aperture 110. P indicates a\n     pressure source and the circle with an arrow indicates a regulator. The\n     bottom surface of the bottom chamber is provided with a plurality of\n     apertures 108 through which the regulated pressure compressed air\n     delivered through aperture 110 may leak. A filter 107 is integrated\n     within mating attachment means 106\' within inlet 106 so that the air\n     inflow (low flow heated/cooled) to the top chamber 3120 is filtered to\n     remove bacteria and contaminants that can cause infection. Filter 107\n     cleans air so that clean air without bacteria is passed through the top\n     chamber 120 and released around the patient, minimizing infection risk.\n[0083] When transfer or lifting of the patient is not required, air\n     delivery to the bottom chamber is generally in a low or off position, so\n     that the bottom chamber is essentially flat or un-inflated. When it is\n     time to initiate lifting or transfer of the patient, air delivery to the\n     bottom chamber is increased or turned on so that regulated pressure of\n     compressed air is delivered into the bottom chamber and flows from the\n     apertures 108, functioning to create an air pocket under the bottom\n     surface 102 of the pad and facilitating lifting or transfer of the\n     patient and pad onto another surface. Regulated compressed air pressure\n     is increased to a high value, air leaks through the apertures 108\n     creating an air cushion between the bottom surface 102 of the pad and an\n     underlying flat or uneven surface, such as a bed, stretcher or an\n     operating table. This air cushion essentially levitates the pad with the\n     patient slightly above the flat or uneven surface, whereby the patient\n     may be laterally displaced with minimal effort. Using this procedure, the\n     patient is easily displaced laterally with minimal effort for example,\n     from a bed to a stretcher or a stretcher to an operating table or any\n     combination thereof. When the patient is moved to a desired location, the\n     compressed air pressure may be brought to substantially zero or very low\n     so that the bottom chamber is substantially flat or un-inflated.\n     Preferably, both the top chamber 120 and the bottom chamber 121 have\n     shallow depths 120\', 121\'. The depth 121\' of the bottom chamber 121\n     preferably ranges from about 1/2 inch to about 3 inches. Owing to the\n     shallow depth 121\' of the bottom chamber 121, two advantages result.\n     First, less air is needed to initiate air leakage through apertures 108\n     when creating the air cushion and the air cushion is created at a more\n     rapid rate than would occur with a less shallow chamber. Second, when\n     flat or collapsed the bottom chamber does not cause any type of\n     discomfort to a patient resting on the pad. The shallow chamber 121\n     virtually eliminates formation of excess material which could cause\n     bunching and create an uncomfortable mass under the patient\'s body when\n     the chamber is flat. Preferably, the depth 120\' of the top chamber 120\n     ranges from about 1/2 inch to about 3 inches. Further advantages are\n     derived from a shallow top chamber. Less air is needed to initiate and\n     maintain the desired air flow regulation of the heated/or cooled air. The\n     structure facilitates faster inflation and air distribution delivery to\n     the patient.\n[0084] FIG. 6a illustrates at 300 the second embodiment of the subject\n     invention. FIG. 6b illustrates a cross-sectional view taken along XI-XI\n     of the embodiment of FIG. 6a. The intraoperative controlled temperature\n     device can be used for heating and/cooling of the immediate area\n     surrounding the patient, by providing the circulation of heated air or\n     cooled air using a low pressure blower. Similar numerical indicia as\n     FIGS. 5a-5b are used for clarity. Pad 101\' is provided with a top chamber\n     120\'\' and a bottom chamber 121\'\' separated from each other by a barrier\n     104a. In this second embodiment, the bottom chamber includes at least two\n     inter-digitizing inflatable chambers 121a and 121b separated by a second\n     barrier 104b. Compartments 121a and 121b are fed individually with their\n     own regulated compressed air supply through inlets 110a and 110b as\n     shown. Ambient air is delivered into the bottom compartment and the two\n     inter-digitizing inflatable chambers 121a and 121b. These\n     inter-digitizing inflatable chambers serve as an alternating pressure pad\n     and include apertures 121a\' and 121b\' integrated therein that feed into\n     the bottom chamber and deliver air out of the bottom apertures 108\'. P\n     indicates a pressure source and the circle with an arrow indicates a\n     regulator. A filter 107 is integrated within mating attachment means 106\'\n     within inlet 3106 so that the air inflow (low flow heated/cooled) to the\n     top chamber 120 is filtered to remove bacteria and contaminants that can\n     cause infection.\n[0085] In another embodiment, the apertures of the top surface of the top\n     chamber may be confined to the upper/head region of the pad, rather than\n     the entire length of the pad. Alternatively, the apertures may instead be\n     confined to the lower portion/lower leg and foot region of the pad.\n[0086] The key features of the patient lifter system wherein\n     intraoperative controlled temperature air surrounds a patient comprise,\n     in combination:\n[0087] i) a pad with a top chamber and a bottom chamber separated by a\n     barrier;\n[0088] ii) said top chamber being provided with a plurality of small\n     apertures on its top surface;\n[0089] iii) said top chamber having an inlet with a filter integrated\n     therein so that the air inflow (low flow heated/cooled) to the top\n     chamber is filtered to remove bacteria and contaminants, thereby\n     delivering clean air without bacteria through the top chamber which is\n     released around the patient, minimizing infection risk;\n[0090] iv) said top chamber being provided with a low pressure supply of\n     compressed heated air or cooled air;\n[0091] v) heated or cooled air being delivered from below the patient to\n     surround the patient;\n[0092] vi) a surgical drape surrounding the patient to provide comfort to\n     the patient without need for a tent or other hardware;\n[0093] vii) said bottom chamber being provided with a supply of compressed\n     ambient air at a pre-selectable regulated air pressure;\n[0094] viii) said bottom chamber having a plurality of apertures on its\n     bottom surface;\n[0095] ix) said ambient air pressure inflating said bottom chamber and\n     being portative to supporting a patient lying on the top surface of the\n     top chamber and the ambient pressure of the bottom surface having a\n     pre-selected low value, minimally discharging ambient air;\n[0096] x) during lateral movement of the patient lying on said pad, the\n     compressed ambient air pressure being increased to a pre-selected high\n     pressure, discharging air through said bottom surface of said bottom\n     chamber to thereby create an air cushion directly under the pad with the\n     patient, allowing easy effort-free movement of the patient from a\n     stretcher to an operating table or from a bed to a stretcher; and\n[0097] xi) the subject pad is the only patient heater that supports the\n     patient\'s head during lateral transfer and avoids neck strains without\n     requiring the anesthetist to hold the patient\'s head while the patient is\n     being moved.\n[0098] In a second embodiment, the pad having a bottom chamber comprising\n     two laterally separated inter-digitizing inflatable chambers therein,\n     each being provided with an individually regulated compressed ambient air\n     supply, for adjusting pressure points.\n[0099] Advantageously, the Patient Lifter with Intraoperative Heater\n     System provides:\n[0100] i) a combination system with operative heater that delivers clean\n     filtered warm or cold air stream surrounding a patient and a patient\n     lifter/patient transport device, wherein the air travels through a filter\n     removing bacteria and contaminants and mitigating risk of infection to\n     the patient;\n[0101] ii) an intraoperative heater device that delivers heat from beneath\n     a patient, and which can be used without a tent, the system having\n     surgical drapes that are placed above the patient and function as a cover\n     when heat is delivered from beneath the patient;\n[0102] iii) an air-cushion forming mechanism for developing compressed\n     ambient air pressure that is increased to a pre-selected high pressure,\n     discharging air through said bottom surface of said bottom chamber to\n     thereby create an air cushion that facilitates lateral movement of the\n     patient onto an operating table or a hospital bed;\n[0103] iv) an intraoperative device that can be used for heating\n     and/cooling, by providing for the circulation of hot or cool air through\n     a low pressure blower; and\n[0104] v) a patient heater--lateral transfer pad that supports the\n     patient\'s head during lateral transfer and avoids neck strains without\n     requiring the anesthetist to hold the patient\'s head while the patient is\n     being moved.\n[0105] Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will\n     be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to, but that\n     additional changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one\n     skilled in the art. The bottom section of the patient lifter can be\n     divided into two inter-digitizing compartments that are pulsed from small\n     pressure to a slightly larger pressure with a preselected pulse\n     frequency, while the top chamber is maintained at a small pressure. With\n     this arrangement, the patient lifter functions as an alternating pressure\n     pad, redistributing points of contact pressure extant between the top\n     surface of the pad and body portions of a patient resting thereon to\n     thereby avoid pressure sores and decubiti. The length and width of the\n     pad can be adjusted to produce a half-size pad configuration that still\n     facilitates lateral movement of the upper torso of the patient. Such\n     modifications are considered to fall within the scope of the invention as\n     defined by the subjoined claims. The top chamber filter is preferably\n     integrated within the inlet. However, in an alternative embodiment, the\n     filter may be formed or integrated within the apertures of the top\n     chamber. In this manner, a filtration sheet is preferably bonded behind\n     the apertures of the top chamber so that air is filtered directly and\n     immediately before contacting the patient.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',

 'patent_description': u'BACKGROUND\n[0001] Prosthetic ball-and-socket hip joints generally include a femoral\n     component and an acetabular component. The acetabular component is a cup\n     positioned in a patient\'s acetabulum, and serves as the socket of the hip\n     joint. The acetabular cup is typically made of a metal material, such as\n     titanium or cobalt chrome, having a porous hemispherical outer surface\n     that allows the acetabular bone to grow in and anchor the cup within the\n     acetabulum. Additionally, a liner of suitable material, such as\n     ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which is received\n     within the acetabular cup, and includes a hemispherical recess for\n     receiving the ball end of the femoral component of the prosthetic hip\n     joint.\n[0002] During a prosthetic hip joint revision procedure, the acetabular\n     cup is removed from the acetabulum and replaced with a new acetabular\n     cup. To remove the acetabular cup, a chisel-like osteotome is used, which\n     includes a blade for cutting through the acetabular bone surrounding the\n     hemispherical outer surface of the acetabular cup, and a head or anvil\n     which may be struck by a mallet to drive the blade through the bone\n     adjacent the acetabulum. In use, the blade of the osteotome is positioned\n     near the acetabular cup, and the head of the osteotome is struck with the\n     mallet to make a cut in the bone adjacent the acetabular cavity near the\n     acetabular cup. Thereafter, the osteotome is withdrawn and repositioned,\n     and the procedure is repeated until sufficient cuts have been made around\n     the acetabular cup to permit removal thereof from the acetabulum.\n     Thereafter, a new acetabular cup can be positioned within the acetabulum.\nSUMMARY\n[0003] The present inventor has recognized, among other things, that what\n     is needed is an improved apparatus and method for quickly and easily\n     removing an acetabular cup from an acetabulum with minimal loss of\n     acetabular bone, while preserving a relatively intact, hemispherical\n     acetabular recess into which a new acetabular cup may be fitted. The\n     present inventor has further recognized that superior force can be\n     generated by striking a lever and/or a dedicated impaction surface\n     connected to the lever to pivot the apparatus to cut around the\n     acetabular cup in order to facilitate removal. The use of superior force\n     can shorten surgery time and reduce anesthesia time and patient blood\n     loss.\n[0004] In one example disclosed herein, an apparatus for an acetabular\n     explant procedure can include a shaft having a longitudinal shaft axis; a\n     handle lever configured to extend from the shaft, the handle lever having\n     a longitudinal lever axis; a first impaction surface disposed along the\n     longitudinal shaft axis; a second impaction surface offset from the\n     longitudinal shaft axis; a coupling portion at a proximal end of the\n     shaft; a pivot element removably coupled to the coupling portion, the\n     pivot element dimensioned to be received within an acetabular cup; and a\n     blade removably coupled to the coupling portion and spaced from the pivot\n     element, wherein when the pivot element is received within the acetabular\n     cup, the blade is disposed externally of the acetabular cup adjacent an\n     outer surface of the acetabular cup.\n[0005] In another example disclosed herein, a system for removing an\n     acetabular cup from an acetabulum can include an osteotome instrument,\n     including; a handle lever having a longitudinal lever axis, a handle\n     lever having a longitudinal lever axis coupled to the shaft at a first\n     end, the handle lever having at least one impaction surface at or\n     adjacent a second end thereof; a coupling portion at a proximal end of\n     the shaft; a plurality of spherical head components each configured to be\n     interchangeably and removably coupled to the coupling portion of the\n     osteotome instrument; and a plurality of blades each configured to be\n     interchangeably and removably coupled to the coupling portion of the\n     osteotome instrument.\n[0006] In another example disclose herein, a method for removing an\n     acetabular cup from an acetabulum can include an osteotome instrument\n     including a first impaction surface, a second impaction surface\n     substantially orthogonal to the first impaction surface, a spherical\n     head, and a blade spaced from the spherical head; seating the spherical\n     head at least partially within the acetabular cup; and impacting the\n     second impaction surface to move the osteotome instrument to make a\n     series of cuts with the blade adjacent an outer surface of the acetabular\n     cup.\n[0007] In Example 20, the method of Example 19 optionally further\n     comprises selecting the second impaction surface from a plurality\n     impaction surfaces on a plurality of extensions, the plurality of\n     extensions having one or more different sizes and/or shapes; and coupling\n     the second impaction surface to the osteotome instrument.\n[0008] In Example 21, the implant or method of any one or any combination\n     of Examples 1-20 is optionally configured such that all elements or\n     options recited are available to use or select from.\n[0009] These and other examples and features of the present prosthetic\n     implants and methods will be set forth in part in the following Detailed\n     Description. This Summary is intended to provide non-limiting examples of\n     the present subject matter--it is not intended to provide an exclusive or\n     exhaustive explanation. The Detailed Description below is included to\n     provide further information about the present tapered adapter and\n     methods.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0010] In the drawings, which are not necessarily drawn to scale, like\n     numerals may describe similar components in different views.

The\n     apparatus includes a handle lever having a longitudinal lever axis\n     coupled to a shaft, the shaft having a longitudinal shaft axis. A first\n     impaction surface is located generally adjacent the longitudinal shaft\n     axis and a second impaction surface is offset from the longitudinal shaft\n     axis. In some instances, the second impaction surface is disposed so as\n     to be substantially orthogonal to the first impaction surface. The can\n     include a coupling portion coupled to a proximal end of the shaft, a\n     spherical pivot element removably coupled to the coupling portion, the\n     pivot element dimensioned to be received within an acetabular cup, and a\n     blade removably coupled to the coupling portion and spaced from the pivot\n     element, wherein when the pivot element is received within the acetabular\n     cup, the blade is disposed externally of the acetabular cup adjacent an\n     outer surface of the acetabular cup.\n[0022] The configuration of the apparatus with the second impaction\n     surface offset from the longitudinal shaft axis allows a torque to be\n     generated, for example, by impacting the second impaction surface with an\n     impactor tool, such as a mallet. Larger degrees of torque can be\n     generated by striking the second impaction surface with the impactor tool\n     than could otherwise be generated by applying manual force by hand to the\n     handle lever. The torque that results from impacting the second impaction\n     surface can rotate the shaft substantially about the longitudinal shaft\n     axis and can allow the blade to cut around the acetabular cup more\n     efficiently with reduced effort. This helps to minimize procedure time,\n     physician fatigue, and patient blood loss.\n[0023] Referring to FIG. 1, surgical system 10 is shown, which can\n     generally include an osteotome instrument 12, one of a plurality of\n     interchangeable pivot elements such as spherical heads 14, a plurality of\n     interchangeable osteotomes 16a, 16b, a driver tool 18, and a coupling\n     shaft 30 for interchangeably securing the osteotomes 16a, 16b to the\n     osteotome instrument 12. Although only one spherical head 14 and two\n     osteotomes 16a, 16b are depicted any number of spherical heads or\n     osteotomes can be included in the surgical system 10. The osteotome\n     instrument 12 can include a shaft 22 including a coupling portion 24 at a\n     proximal end thereof. A handle lever 27 can be coupled at a coupling\n     location 28 of the shaft 22. The shaft 22 can include a longitudinal\n     shaft axis L, and the handle lever 27 can include a longitudinal lever\n     axis H. The longitudinal lever axis H can intersect the longitudinal\n     shaft axis L at any suitable angle, such as a right angle as illustrated\n     in FIG. 1. As described herein, the coupling location 28 can include, for\n     example, a threaded connection, a snap fit connection, a press fit\n     connection, or a fixed connection, such as a welded coupling. In an\n     example, the handle lever 27 and shaft 22 can be formed as a single\n     unitary object. In an example, the shaft 22 and handle lever 27 can be\n     grasped to manipulate the osteotome instrument 12, as described herein.\n     In another example, the shaft 22 and the handle lever 27 can be coupled\n     so as to be perpendicular with respect to one another.\n[0024] The osteotome instrument 12 can include a first impaction surface\n     26 along the longitudinal shaft axis L of the shaft 22. For example, the\n     impaction surface 26 can be positioned at a distal end of the shaft 22.\n     The impaction surface 26, in an example, can be a top surface 23 of an\n     expanded portion of the shaft 22. The expanded portion can provide a\n     benefit, including, but not limited to, a larger surface area for\n     impaction by a mallet (not shown) or other suitable striking instrument.\n     The osteotome instrument 12 can include a unitary or removable extension,\n     such as extensions 2a and 2b in FIG. 1, located at an end of the handle\n     lever 27 opposite of the coupling location 28. Extensions 2a and 2b can\n     each include one or more second impaction surfaces 4a and 4b,\n     respectively. In an example, each of the extensions 2a and 2b can include\n     a pair of substantially opposing impaction surfaces that can allow the\n     lever 27 to rotate in a first direction about the longitudinal shaft axis\n     L by impacting one of the pair of impaction surfaces, and to rotate in an\n     opposite, second direction about the longitudinal shaft axis L by\n     impacting the other one of the pair of impaction surfaces. Although a\n     pair of substantially opposing impaction surfaces is described, any\n     number of impaction surfaces can be provided without departing from the\n     intended scope of the present disclosure. As set forth above, the second\n     impaction surfaces 4a and 4b can be permanently coupled to the handle\n     lever 27, or alternatively, the second impaction surfaces 4a and 4b can\n     be provided on modular extensions 2a and 2b that can be coupled to the\n     handle lever 27 as desired. The particular configuration of the impaction\n     surfaces 4a and 4b can be selected as desired by the surgeon. In some\n     instances, it may not be necessary or desirable to utilize the second\n     impaction surfaces 4a and/or 4b. In such circumstances, the surgeon may\n     instead contact one or more surfaces of the handle lever 27 directly with\n     the impactor tool. As will be discussed in further detail below, the\n     handle lever 27 can be provided with one or more flat or substantially\n     flat surfaces for this purpose. However, handle levers 27 having any\n     shape and exterior contour can be contacted with an impactor tool to\n     generate a torque for cutting around an acetabular cup, including a\n     handle lever 27 having a generally circular cross-section.\n[0025] As described herein, the second impaction surfaces 4a and/or 4b can\n     provide one or more benefits, including but not limited to, easier more\n     rapid removal of an acetabular cup from an acetabulum by providing\n     greater torque on the handle lever 27 of the osteotome instrument 12\n     compared to manually pulling or pushing the handle lever 27.\n     Additionally, the second impaction surfaces 4a and/or 4b can help\n     facilitate easier more rapid removal of the implant by allowing high\n     impact forces to be used in cutting the acetabular cup circumferentially\n     from the hip. As can be appreciated, cutting through acetabular bone and\n     other tissues can be very difficult unless a source of external torque\n     greater than that provided by a surgeon manually pulling or pushing the\n     handle lever 27 by hand is provided as described herein.\n[0026] The coupling portion 24 of the osteotome instrument 12 can include\n     a coupling shaft 30 projecting therefrom generally parallel to shaft 22,\n     onto which the spherical head 14 can be attached to secure the spherical\n     head 14 to the osteotome instrument 12. Any suitable means of attachment\n     can be used including, but not limited to, threads, a press-fit\n     connection, a snap-fit connection, or the like. In an example, the\n     coupling shaft 30 can have external threads configured to engage with\n     internal threads in the spherical head 14. The spherical head 14 can\n     include a substantially spherical pivot surface 32, such as at a bottom\n     of the spherical head 14. In an example, the spherical head 14 can\n     include a plurality of indentations 34 therein to allow spherical head 14\n     to be easily grasped during attachment of the spherical head 14 to the\n     coupling shaft 30, or detachment therefrom. The surgical system 10 can\n     include a plurality of spherical heads 14 of different sizes, each\n     spherical head 14 sized for use with acetabular cups of different sizes.\n     Suitable spherical heads 14 and osteotomes 16a, 16b can be selected\n     depending upon the dimensions of the acetabular cup to be removed such\n     that, when a corresponding spherical head 14 and osteotome 16a, 16b are\n     attached to the instrument, the spacing between the blade 38a, 38b and\n     center of the spherical head 14 corresponds to the spacing between the\n     center of the recess in the acetabular cup liner and the rim of the\n     acetabular cup. In an example, a plurality of osteotomes 16a, 16b can be\n     provided, wherein each osteotome includes a blade, such as 38a, 38b. Each\n     of the plurality of osteotomes 16a, 16b can be dimensioned to correspond\n     to a corresponding acetabular cup. The system 10 can include the\n     plurality of blades 38a, 38b wherein each blade of the plurality of\n     blades has different dimensions, such as a blade length. That is, the\n     system 10 can include corresponding sets of osteotomes 16a, 16b, blades\n     38a, 38b, and spherical heads 14.\n[0027] Referring again to FIG. 1, the osteotome instrument 12 can further\n     include an osteotome-receiving feature or recess 48 in the coupling\n     portion 24 thereof, having a notch 52. An osteotome clamping screw 50 can\n     be disposed within the recess 48 and threaded into (or otherwise coupled\n     to) the coupling portion 24 of the osteotome instrument 12. The osteotome\n     clamping screw 50, in an example, can be movable between a loosened and a\n     tightened position, and further, may be retained by the coupling portion\n     24 in the loosened position to prevent detachment of the osteotome\n     clamping screw 50, so as to simplify the interchanging of osteotomes 16a,\n     16b during a surgical procedure. As an example, the osteotome 16b is\n     described in more detail in reference to FIGS. 7 and 8 herein.\n[0028] A shown in FIG. 1, to attach one of the osteotomes 16a, 16b to the\n     instrument 12, the chosen osteotome can be placed within the recess 48\n     such that the osteotome clamping screw 50 is disposed within the slot 44\n     of the blade 38a, 38b, and a tooth 43 of the blade 16a, 16b is fitted\n     within the notch 52 with the blade clamping screw 50 in a loosened\n     position. Thereafter, the osteotome clamping screw 50 can be tightened\n     using the driver tool 18 and adaptor 20 such that a collar 51 of\n     osteotome clamping screw 50 engages a ledge 46 (see FIG. 9) of the blade\n     16a, 16b to secure the blade. The driver tool 18 (see FIG. 1) can be\n     adjusted to deliver a predetermined amount of torque to the osteotome\n     clamping screw 50, so as to prevent the collar 51 of osteotome clamping\n     screw 50 from being tightened onto the ledge 46 of the osteotome 16a, 16b\n     beyond a desired clamping force.\n[0029] FIG. 2 illustrates a perspective view of the osteotome instrument\n     12, a impactor tool 8 and an acetabulum 58 of a hip joint including an\n     acetabular cup 60 fitted therein, in accordance with at least one example\n     of the present disclosure. As described herein, the second osteotome 16b\n     having a longer blade 38b can be attached to the instrument, as described\n     in relation to FIG. 1. The spherical head 14, selected from a plurality\n     of spherical heads, can be seated within the hemispherical recess 64 of a\n     cup liner 62 of the acetabular cup 60, which is anchored in the\n     acetabulum 58. As shown in FIG. 2, the handle lever 27 can include any\n     suitable cross-sectional shape or combination of shapes, such as\n     circular, square, or rectangular, for example. FIG. 2 depicts the handle\n     lever 27 having a rectangular or square cross-section with substantially\n     flat first and second side surfaces 3a. These side surfaces 3a can be\n     impacted by an impaction tool in a manner similar to impaction surfaces\n     4a in order to generate a larger torque transfer to the shaft 22, which,\n     in turn, can be transferred to the cutting surfaces of the blade 38b to\n     allow for quicker, easier, and more effective cutting of the acetabulum\n     59 and surrounding tissues.\n[0030] In an example, the handle lever 27 can include the extension 2a at\n     an opposite end of the handle lever 27 from the coupling location 28. The\n     extension 2a can include the second impaction surfaces 4a (side surfaces\n     of the extension 2a), top and underside surfaces 5, and a front surface\n     6. If necessary, each surface of the extension 2a can be used as a\n     striking surface so as to aid in cutting the bone 59 adjacent the\n     acetabular cup 60, as described herein. As illustrated, the pair of\n     impaction surfaces 4a of the extension 2a can be utilized in some\n     examples to aid in providing a dedicated impact area for the impactor\n     tool. In other examples, a dedicated impactor surface may not be utilized\n     and contact can be made with the substantially flat first and/or second\n     side surfaces 3a and 3b. One or both of the second impaction surface(s)\n     4a and the extension 2a can be offset longitudinally from the first\n     impaction surface 26 (e.g., a top surface) of the handle lever 27. In\n     some cases, the second impaction surface(s) 4a can be disposed\n     substantially orthogonal to the first impaction surface 26. This\n     arrangement can facilitate rotation of the shaft 22 about the\n     longitudinal shaft axis (FIG. 1) by striking one of the second impaction\n     surface(s) 4a, as well as facilitating translation of the shaft 22\n     axially along the longitudinal shaft axis by striking the first impaction\n     surface 26. In some instances the first impaction surface 26 can provide\n     the benefit of an area for an operator to grab while striking the second\n     impaction surface(s) 4a with a mallet or other suitable impaction\n     instrument.\n[0031] Impactor tool 8 can apply a significant amount of impact force to\n     the second impaction surface(s) 4a (and/or first and second side surfaces\n     3a and 3b) as well as the first impaction surface 26. This force is\n     magnified by the length of the handle lever 27 to facilitate torque about\n     the shaft 22. This torque can cause rotation of components attached to\n     the shaft 22 such as the osteotome 16b and blade 38b. The torque causes\n     the blade 38a to cut around the acetabular cup 60 as previously\n     described.\n[0032] FIG. 2A illustrates a top view of a portion of the handle lever 27\n     and the extension 2a, in accordance with at least one example of the\n     present disclosure. The extension 2a can include a pair of opposing\n     second impaction surfaces 4a. The handle lever 27 can include the first\n     and second side surfaces 3a and 3b previously described. Furthermore, the\n     extension 2a can include the top 5 surface, underside surface (not\n     shown), and the front surface 6.\n[0033] As shown in FIG. 2A, the first and second side surfaces 3a and 3b\n     of the handle lever 27, the top and bottom surfaces 5 of the extension\n     2a, the top surface 7 of the handle lever 27, and the second impaction\n     surface(s) 4a of the extension 2a can be substantially flat (i.e. have a\n     small amount of curvature). However, in some examples the second\n     impaction surface(s) 4a (and the first and second side surfaces 3a and\n     3b, the top surface 7, etc.) can be provided with curvature as desired.\n     Substantially flat surfaces allow the various impaction surfaces to be\n     more effectively contacted by the impactor tool 8 (FIG. 2) to provide\n     force to cut around the acetabular cup 60.\n[0034] FIG. 3 illustrates a top view of a portion of the handle lever 27\n     and the alternative extension 2b, in accordance with at least one example\n     of the present disclosure. The extension 2b can include at least one or,\n     as shown, a pair of opposing second impaction surfaces 4b. As is\n     illustrated in FIG. 3, the extension 2b can be cylindrical in shape with\n     the second impact surfaces 4b comprising both ends thereof. As previously\n     illustrated the extension 2b (and extension 2a, etc.) can be a modular\n     component that can be selected and attached to the handle lever 27\n     according to some examples. In other examples, the extension 2b (and\n     extension 2a, etc.) can be formed integral with the handle lever 27. In\n     yet other examples, each handle lever 27 can be formed with a unique\n     extension, and the handle lever 27 can be removable coupled to the shaft\n     22.\n[0035] FIGS. 4-6 illustrate an exemplary use of the osteotome instrument\n     12 to remove an acetabular cup 60, in accordance with at least one\n     example of the present disclosure. The first osteotome 16a having the\n     first blade 38a, such as a short blade, can be attached to the osteotome\n     instrument 12, as described herein in relation to FIGS. 1 and 7-8. The\n     spherical head 14 of the osteotome instrument 12 can be seated within a\n     hemispherical recess 64 of the liner 62 of the acetabular cup 60, which\n     is anchored in the acetabulum 58 of the patient. An impactor tool 53 can\n     be pressed against the dimple 54 in a rear side 56 of the coupling\n     portion 24 so as to aid in seating the spherical head 14 within the\n     recess 64 of the acetabular cup 60. For example, the impactor tool 53 can\n     include an elongated rod member dimensioned to be at least partially\n     received by the dimple 54. Although shown as being positioned only\n     slightly below a surface on the rear side 56, the dimple 54 can, in an\n     example, extend further within the coupling portion 24, such as 1/4, 1/2,\n     3/4, or more within the rear side 56.\n[0036] As shown in the example illustrated in FIG. 4, the first blade 38a\n     of the osteotome 16a can be spaced a distance from the center of the\n     spherical head 14 which corresponds to the distance between a center C of\n     recess 64, or the center of spherical head 14, and a rim 66 of the\n     acetabular cup 60, such that the first blade 38a is disposed closely\n     adjacent an outer hemispherical surface 68 of the acetabular cup 60.\n[0037] As illustrated in FIG. 5, the first impaction surface can be stuck\n     to drive the first blade 38a into the bone 59 as indicated by arrow 70.\n     The first blade 38a can include an end cutting edge that facilitates\n     cutting along path 70. The shaft 22 of the osteotome instrument 12 can be\n     pivoted by, for example, striking one or more of the second impaction\n     surface(s) (see 4a, 4b in FIGS. 2-3) and/or side surface (see 3a, 3b in\n     FIGS. 2-2A) such that as the first blade 38a moves along the path of\n     arrow 71 as shown in FIG. 5. A side cutting edge(s) of the first blade\n     38a cuts bone 59 around the outer hemispherical surface 68 of the\n     acetabular cup 60 to a first depth D1. The first depth D1 extends\n     substantially from the rim 66 to an apex 69 of the acetabular cup 60.\n     Thereafter, the shaft 22 of the osteotome instrument 12 can be pivoted in\n     the reverse direction along the path of the arrow 70 to withdraw the\n     first blade 38a. During such withdrawal, the engagement between the tooth\n     43 of the osteotome 16a within the notch 52 in the coupling portion 24 of\n     the osteotome instrument 12 can prevents disengagement of the osteotome\n     16a from the instrument 12 in the event that the blade clamping screw 50\n     is not sufficiently tightened.\n[0038] The offset location of the top surface 5 of extension 2a (FIGS. 2\n     and 2A) relative to the first impaction surface 26 can provide for an\n     angled driving force imparted on the blade 38a. In an example, the\n     underside surface 5 of the extension 2a can be struck to adjust the blade\n     38a relative to the bone 59. As discussed, a large amount of impact force\n     can be applied to the handle lever 27 (FIGS. 1 and 2) via the second\n     impaction surface 4a, 4b, and/or side surfaces 3a, 3b, etc. This force is\n     magnified by the length of the handle lever 27 to create a large torque\n     used to rotate the osteotome instrument 12 such that the blade 38a cuts\n     around the acetabular cup 60. Thus, as shown by arrow 71 in FIG. 5, the\n     handle lever 27 of the osteotome instrument 12 can be used to rotate the\n     first blade 38a, striking at least one second impaction surface (see 4a,\n     4b in FIGS. 2-3) and/or side surface of the handle lever 27 (see 3a, 3b\n     in FIGS. 2-2A) as necessary with a mallet or other striking instrument,\n     to make an orbital cut about the outer hemispherical surface 68 of the\n     acetabular cup 60 using the first blade 38a. Advantageously, as can be\n     seen in FIGS. 5 and 6, the first blade 38a is spaced closely adjacent the\n     outer hemispherical surface 68 of acetabular cup 60 during the cutting\n     procedure described herein, allowing bone 59 around the acetabular cup 60\n     to be cut closely adjacent to acetabular cup 60, such that loss of bone\n     59 is minimized.\n[0039] As shown in FIG. 6, the second osteotome 16b having the second\n     blade 38b, such as a long blade, may be attached to the coupling portion\n     24 of the instrument 12 as described above, wherein the second blade 38b\n     extends to the apex 69 of the acetabular cup 60 when the osteotome\n     instrument 12 is actuated along the direction of the arrow 70. The\n     osteotome instrument 12, with the osteotome 16b attached thereto, can be\n     used in the same manner as described above with respect to the osteotome\n     16a to cut bone 59 surrounding the periphery of the acetabular cup 60\n     from the first depth D1, to a second depth D2 at apex 69 of the\n     acetabular cup 60. After the bone 59 surrounding the acetabular cup 60 is\n     cut away therefrom following path indicated by arrow 71, the acetabular\n     cup 60 can be removed from the acetabulum 58, leaving an intact,\n     hemispherical recess in the acetabulum 58 into which a replacement\n     acetabular cup may be fitted. In an example, the top surface 5 of the\n     extension 2a (FIGS. 2 and 2a) can be struck downwardly to aid in removing\n     the acetabular cup 60, such as by providing torque due to the offset\n     location of the top surface 5 relative to the longitudinal shaft axis of\n     the shaft 22.\n[0040] FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate perspective views of an interchangeable\n     osteotome, such as the osteotome 16b, in accordance with at least one\n     example of the present disclosure. As discussed above, the osteotomes\n     16a, 16b may be interchangeably connected to coupling portion 24 of\n     instrument 12. The osteotome 16b is shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 for purposes\n     of example, and can include head portion 36 with curved blade 38b\n     extending therefrom. The blade 38b can include an end cutting surface 40\n     and a pair of side cutting surfaces 42. The head portion 36 of the\n     osteotome 16b can also include a tooth 43, and a slot 44 having a\n     semi-annular ledge 46.\n[0041] FIG. 9 illustrates a flow diagram of a method 80 for removing an\n     acetabular cup. An osteotome instrument can be provided or obtained at\n     82. The osteotome instrument can be, for example, the osteotome\n     instrument 12 described herein. The osteotome instrument can include a\n     first impaction surface, a second impaction surface offset from the first\n     impaction surface, a spherical head, and a blade spaced from the\n     spherical head. In an example, the spherical head can be fully received\n     in the acetabular cup 84. The method 80 can include selecting a spherical\n     head from a plurality of spherical heads of different sizes and coupling\n     the spherical head to the osteotome instrument, as described herein.\n[0042] At 86, the instrument can be moved to make a series of cuts with\n     the blade which are adjacent to an outer surface of the acetabular cup.\n     For example, the handle lever of the osteotome instrument can be pivoted,\n     such as by striking the second impaction surface with a mallet or similar\n     instrument, or by striking one of the side surfaces of the handle lever.\n     In an example, the method 80 can include selecting a blade from a\n     plurality of blades of different dimensions and coupling the blade to the\n     instrument, as described herein. In some examples a surface of the handle\n     lever, an extension of the handle lever, or another surface can be\n     impacted so as to remove the acetabular cup from the acetabulum.\n     Impacting, for example, an extension of the handle lever or the handle\n     lever itself can provide an upward (lift) moment to the osteotome and the\n     blade, such that the acetabular cup can be removed or otherwise forced\n     out of the acetabulum, after the acetabular cup has been freed, by\n     cutting of the adjacent bone.\n[0043] To better illustrate the acetabular explant apparatus and related\n     methods disclosed herein, a non-limiting list of examples is provided\n     here:\n[0044] In Example 1, an apparatus for an acetabular explant procedure can\n     include a shaft having a longitudinal shaft axis;

When adequate stability is not achieved, the bone segment(s)\n     may move, resulting in inferior biomechanics due to deviation from the\n     planned alignment. Lack of compression at the osteotomy interface can\n     also result in delayed or non-union outcomes. Many conventional bone\n     plates also necessitate a multitude of plate designs in multiple sizes\n     and orientations to address various clinical indications in bones,\n     complicating bone plate selection and use. Accordingly, improvements to\n     bone plates are desirable.\nSUMMARY\n[0004] Certain embodiments of the disclosure concern bone plates for use\n     with long bones. In an exemplary embodiment, a bone plate comprises a\n     curved elongated body including a first end portion and a second end\n     portion. The first end portion is laterally offset relative to the second\n     end portion. The bone plate further includes a plurality of screw holes\n     defined by the first end portion, and a first screw hole defined by the\n     second end portion. Each of the screw holes of the first end portion are\n     laterally offset from a straight line extending in a direction along a\n     length dimension of the bone plate and bisecting the first screw hole of\n     the second end portion, and each of the screw holes of the first end\n     portion are on the same side of the straight line as one another.\n[0005] In another representative embodiment, a bone plate comprises an\n     elongated body including a first end portion and a second end portion.\n     The elongated body defines an upper surface and a lower surface, and has\n     a V-shaped cross section. The elongated body is curved such that the\n     first end portion is laterally offset relative to the second end portion.\n     The bone plate further includes a plurality of screw holes defined by the\n     first end portion and a plurality of screw holes defined by the second\n     end portion, at least one of the screw holes of the second end portion\n     being a first compression screw hole oriented such that a straight line\n     extending along a longitudinal axis of the first compression screw hole\n     passes through a proximal screw hole of the first end portion.\n[0006] In another representative embodiment, a method comprises placing a\n     bone plate on an end portion of a long bone. The bone plate includes a\n     curved elongated body having a first end portion and a second end\n     portion. The first end portion is laterally offset relative to the second\n     end portion, and the first end portion defines a plurality of screw\n     holes. The second end portion defines at least one screw hole, and each\n     of the screw holes of the first end portion are laterally offset from a\n     straight line extending in a direction along a length dimension of the\n     bone plate and bisecting the at least one screw hole of the second end\n     portion. Each of the screw holes of the first end portion are on the same\n     side of the straight line as one another. The method further comprises\n     securing the bone plate to the long bone.\n[0007] The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the\n     disclosed technology will become more apparent from the following\n     detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying\n     figures.\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n[0008] FIGS. 1-3 are representative examples of saw blades that can be\n     used in the osteotomy procedures described herein.\n[0009] FIGS. 4A-4C illustrate a representative femoral neck angle\n     correction procedure.\n[0010] FIGS. 5A-5C illustrate a representative femoral version correction\n     procedure.\n[0011] FIGS. 6A-6C illustrate a representative distal femoral loading\n     angle correction procedure.\n[0012] FIGS. 7A-7C illustrate a representative humeral neck angle\n     correction procedure.\n[0013] FIGS. 8A-8C illustrate a representative proximal humeral version\n     correction procedure.\n[0014] FIGS. 9A-9C illustrate a representative high tibial osteotomy\n     procedure.\n[0015] FIGS. 10A-10C illustrate a representative tibial plateau leveling\n     osteotomy (TPLO) procedure.\n[0016] FIGS. 11A-11C illustrate medial and lateral patellar luxation.\n[0017] FIGS. 12A-12C illustrate a representative repair of a ruptured\n     cranial cruciate ligament by performing a TPLO.\n[0018] FIGS. 13A-13C illustrate operation of a representative embodiment\n     of a compression screw hole that can be used in combination with any of\n     the bone plates described herein.\n[0019] FIG. 14 is a plan view of a representative embodiment of a bone\n     plate.\n[0020] FIG. 15 is an end view of the bone plate of FIG. 14.\n[0021] FIG. 16 is a plan view of the bone plate of FIG. 14 illustrating\n     the location of protruding portions on the lower side of the bone plate.\n[0022] FIG. 17 is a cross-sectional view of a protruding portion taken\n     along line X-X of FIG. 16.\n[0023] FIG. 18 is a side elevation view of the bone plate of FIG. 14\n     illustrating the angle of the first end portion relative to the second\n     end portion.\n[0024] FIG. 19A is an end view of the bone plate of FIG. 14.\n[0025] FIG. 19B is a cross-sectional view of the bone plate taken along\n     line X-X of FIG. 19A illustrating the angles at which a bone screw may be\n     inserted through a screw hole.\n[0026] FIGS. 20A-20C illustrate the location and range of angles at which\n     bone screws may be inserted into a bone segment through the screw holes\n     of the first end portion of the bone plate of FIG. 14 in a TPLO\n     procedure.\n[0027] FIG. 21 illustrates a prior art bone plate.\n[0028] FIGS. 22A and 22B illustrate the location and range of angles at\n     which bone screws may be inserted into a tibia through the screw holes of\n     the second end portion of the bone plate of FIG. 14 in a TPLO procedure.\n[0029] FIG. 23 illustrates a left-handed configuration of the bone plate\n     of FIG. 14 in which the screw holes are marked with numbers indicating an\n     exemplary order in which bone screws may be inserted into the screw\n     holes.\n[0030] FIGS. 24-26 illustrate placement of the bone plate of FIG. 14 on\n     various aspects of the femur, humerus, and tibia.\n[0031] FIGS. 27 and 28 illustrate another embodiment of a locking screw\n     hole that can be used in combination with any of the bone plates\n     described herein.\n[0032] FIGS. 29 and 30 illustrate a representative embodiment of a locking\n     screw.\n[0033] FIGS. 31A-31C illustrate engagement of the locking screw of FIG. 29\n     with the screw hole of FIG. 27.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n[0034] In human and animal orthopedics, various saw blades are available\n     to make osteotomies in bone. Straight osteotomies, radial osteotomies,\n     and spherical osteotomies can be created at specific locations in long\n     bones to achieve realignment of a bone segment to the overall limb axis\n     for improved biomechanics. Representative examples of a flat saw blade, a\n     radial saw blade, and a spherical or dome saw blade are shown in FIGS.\n     1-3, respectively.\n[0035] There are multiple physiological problems associated with long\n     bones that can affect limb biomechanics, which can occur as a result of\n     trauma (e.g., bone fractures that heal in a misaligned position), or\n     birth defects. Surgical methods of re-establishing appropriate\n     biomechanics of a limb can include repositioning proximal and distal bone\n     segments to correct alignment issues. There are clinical examples for\n     many long bones (e.g., femur, tibia, humerus, radius, ulna, etc.), which\n     can be managed through corrective osteotomies to restore improved limb\n     function. With reference to the femur, there are proximal and distal\n     corrective osteotomies that can address different biomechanical alignment\n     issues.\n[0036] For example, a representative femoral neck angle correction is\n     shown in FIGS. 4A-4C. FIG. 4A illustrates a normal angle .theta. between\n     a longitudinal axis 12 of a femur 10 and a longitudinal axis 14 of the\n     femoral neck 16. FIG. 4B illustrates a case in which the angle .beta.\n     between the longitudinal axis 12 of the femur and the longitudinal axis\n     14 of the femoral neck is greater than normal. The angle of the femoral\n     neck can be corrected by performing an osteotomy (e.g., with flat saw\n     blade) to remove a wedge-shaped portion 18 of the femur (FIG. 4B) to\n     locate the femoral neck at the desired angle .theta. (FIG. 4C).\n[0037] A representative femoral version correction is shown in FIGS.\n     5A-5C, wherein the femoral anteversion angle .theta. between the\n     longitudinal axis 14 of the femoral neck 16 is corrected relative to a\n     horizontal plane 20. FIG. 5A illustrates a normal femoral anteversion\n     angle .theta., while FIG. 5B illustrates a femoral anteversion angle\n     .beta. that is less than normal. By performing an osteotomy (e.g., with a\n     flat saw blade) to rotate the femoral neck 16, the anteversion angle can\n     be corrected, as shown in FIG. 5C.\n[0038] A representative distal femoral loading angle correction is shown\n     in FIGS. 6A-6C. FIG. 6A illustrates a normal femoral loading angle\n     .theta. between a loading axis 22 and an anatomical axis 24, while FIG.\n     6B illustrates an abnormal loading angle .beta.. By performing an\n     osteotomy (e.g., with a radial saw blade) to rotate a distal end portion\n     26 of the femur 10, the loading angle can be corrected, as shown in FIG.\n     6C.\n[0039] There can be similar clinical issues with the humerus, as\n     illustrated in FIGS. 7A-7C and 8A-8C. For example, FIGS. 7A-7C illustrate\n     a representative humeral neck angle correction, with a normal humeral\n     neck angle .theta. between a longitudinal axis 28 of the humerus 30 and a\n     longitudinal axis 32 of the humeral neck 34 shown in FIG. 7A, and an\n     abnormal humeral neck angle .beta. illustrated in FIG. 7B. By performing\n     an osteotomy to rotate a proximal portion 36 of the humerus 30, the neck\n     angle can be corrected, as illustrated in FIG. 7C.\n[0040] FIGS. 8A-8C illustrate a representative proximal humeral version\n     correction, with a head-neck angle .theta. between a longitudinal axis 38\n     of the humerus 30 and an axis 40 of the proximal humerus 36 shown in FIG.\n     8A, and an abnormal humeral version angle .beta. shown in FIG. 8B. By\n     performing an osteotomy to rotate the proximal portion 36 of the humerus\n     30 in the manner indicated, the humeral version angle can be corrected,\n     as shown in FIG. 8C.\n[0041] Osteotomies of the tibia can involve plateau positional changes to\n     correct over-loading of areas of the articular surface (e.g., surfaces\n     with cartilage). In humans, a high tibial osteotomy (HTO) can be\n     performed to balance the loading in both compartments of the knee, as\n     shown in FIGS. 9A-9C. FIG. 9A illustrates a normal femuro-tibial loading\n     angle .theta. between a loading axis 42 of a femur 44 and a longitudinal\n     axis 46 of a tibia 48 wherein about 60% of the load applied by the femur\n     is borne by the medial aspect of proximal tibia and about 40% of the load\n     is borne by the lateral aspect of the proximal tibia. FIG. 9B illustrates\n     the case of an abnormal femuro-tibial loading angle .beta. wherein, in\n     some examples, about 80% of the load applied by the femur can be borne by\n     the medial aspect of the tibia and only about 20% of the load can be\n     borne by the lateral aspect of the tibia. The angle .beta. can be\n     corrected by performing an osteotomy to remove a wedge-shaped portion 50\n     of the proximal tibia (FIG. 9B) to restore a normal femuro-tibial loading\n     angle .theta., as illustrated in FIG. 9C.\n[0042] In veterinary medicine, a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO)\n     can be performed to re-position the tibial plateau to, for example,\n     function as a buttress to resist certain physiological movements or\n     address rupture of the anterior (cranial) cruciate ligament. FIGS.\n     10A-10C illustrate a representative example of a TPLO procedure. FIG. 10A\n     illustrates a normal angle .theta. between a plane 52 defined by the\n     tibial plateau 54 and a horizontal reference plane 56. In certain\n     circumstances, it can be beneficial to rotate the plane 52 of the tibial\n     plateau 54 to reduce the angle between the tibial plateau and the\n     reference plane 56. This can be accomplished by creating a radial cut in\n     a proximal portion 58 of the tibia 60 and rotating the excised portion 62\n     such that the angle between the tibial plateau 54 and the horizontal\n     reference plane 56 is lowered (e.g., to about 6 degrees in some\n     embodiments), as shown in FIGS. 10B and 10C.\n[0043] Patellar luxation is another example of a pathology that may be\n     addressed by osteotomy procedures. With reference to FIGS. 11A-11C,\n     patellar luxation can occur when there is a misalignment between the\n     quadriceps mechanism generally indicated at 64 and the trochlear groove\n     66 of the distal femur 68, and/or when there is a disparity between the\n     loading axis 70 of the leg and the anatomical axis 72, as illustrated in\n     FIG. 11A. In such circumstances, when the knee is flexed, the patella 74\n     can travel out of the trochlear groove 66, or luxate, resulting in pain\n     and limited motion and function. Lateral luxation of the patella 74 is\n     illustrated in FIG. 11B, while medial luxation is illustrated in FIG.\n     11C. By performing a distal femoral correction osteotomy in the manner of\n     FIGS. 6A-6C, the distal aspect of the femur 68 can be realigned with the\n     pull of the quadriceps 64 to re-establish alignment, stability, and\n     function.\n[0044] As another example, a TPLO may be performed to compensate for\n     ruptures of the cranial cruciate ligament (for example, in dogs). A\n     representative example of a TPLO to repair a ruptured cranial cruciate\n     ligament is illustrated in FIGS. 12A-12C. As illustrated in FIG. 12A, the\n     cranial cruciate ligament 76 can extend between the femur 78 and the\n     tibia 80, and can resist advancement of the tibia in the direction\n     indicated by arrow 82 due to force applied to the tibia by the femur.\n     FIG. 12B illustrates forward advancement of the tibia 80 in the direction\n     of arrow 82 due to rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament 76. In a\n     typical example, an osteotomy using any of the saw blades disclosed\n     herein can be made in the lateral plane on the medial side of the tibia\n     80 to reduce the angle .theta. of the tibial plateau 84 with respect to a\n     horizontal reference plane 86, as illustrated in FIG. 12C. This can\n     create a mechanical abutment in the caudal aspect of the knee, assisting\n     the soft tissues in preventing the femur from sliding off the back of the\n     tibia, mitigating the effects of a non-functional cranial cruciate\n     ligament.\n[0045] Bone plates used in association with osteotomy procedures such as\n     the procedures described herein can provide two primary functions, namely\n     stabilization of the osteotomy and compression of the osteotomy. In some\n     embodiments, the bone plates described herein can incorporate one or more\n     compression slots or compression screw holes that utilize an internal\n     ramp within the side walls of the screw hole to apply compression to the\n     underlying osteotomy. FIG. 13A illustrates a plan view of a\n     representative bone plate 88 including a compression screw hole 90, and\n     FIGS. 13B and 13C illustrate sectional views taken through the bone plate\n     88 along line X-X of FIG. 13A. A screw 92 can be inserted through the\n     opening of the compression slot 90, and the head 94 of the screw can\n     contact a ramp 96. As the screw 92 is tightened and advanced into the\n     bone, the head of the screw applies pressure to the sloped surface of the\n     ramp causing the bone plate to move in the direction indicated by arrow\n     98 shown in FIG. 13C. This can cause bone sections on opposite sides of\n     the osteotomy to be drawn together and compressed, reducing the space\n     between the bone sections at the osteotomy site. In some embodiments,\n     such ramp and screw configurations can close a gap of, for example, about\n     one (1) mm, and can provide compression (e.g., of about 10 pounds) of the\n     bone sections against one another at the osteotomy interface. The ramp\n     can have different configurations as, for example, an inclined plane or\n     an inclined curvilinear surface, as shown.\n[0046] FIG. 14 illustrates a bone plate 100 having an elongated body 101\n     including a first end portion 102 (also referred to as a proximal end\n     portion) and a second end portion 104 (also referred to as a distal end\n     portion). With reference to the coordinate axes of FIG. 14, the bone\n     plate can be curved in the X-Y plane such that the first end portion 102\n     is offset from the second end portion 104 in a direction along the\n     X-axis. The first end portion 102 can have a generally curved shape, and\n     can include a proximal lobe 128 and a distal lobe 130 separated from one\n     another by a recessed portion 132. The first end portion can also define\n     one or more screw holes. For example, in the illustrated embodiment the\n     first end portion includes three screw holes 116, 118, 120 for receiving\n     any of a variety of bone fixation screws. The screw holes 116, 118, 120\n     can be arranged in a generally triangular arrangement, with screw hole\n     116 being located on the proximal lobe 128 and the screw hole 120 being\n     located on the distal lobe 130. In the illustrated embodiment, the screw\n     hole 118 can be intermediate screw holes 116, 118, and offset from screw\n     holes 116, 118 along the X-axis. In some embodiments, the location of the\n     screw holes can be associated with optimal bone cross sections (for\n     example, areas in which the cortical bone is thicker to aid in fixation),\n     although it should be appreciated that the first end portion can include\n     any suitable number of screw holes located at any suitable location.\n[0047] Referring still to FIG. 14, the second end portion 104 can have a\n     generally curved shape, and can have a width dimension that is less than\n     a width dimension of the first end portion 102. For example, in the\n     illustrated embodiment, the first and second end portions can be joined\n     by a transition region generally indicated at 134, in which the width of\n     the bone plate tapers from the relatively wider first end portion to the\n     relatively narrower second end portion.\n[0048] The second end portion can also define one or more screw holes. For\n     example, in the illustrated embodiment the second end portion can define\n     three screw holes 122, 124, 126, with screw holes 122 and 126 being\n     configured as compression screw holes, although the second end portion\n     can include any suitable number of screw holes in any suitable\n     configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, the compression screw hole\n     122 can be oriented generally in the direction of the lobes 128, 130 of\n     the first end portion 102 such that a straight line 136 extending along a\n     longitudinal axis of the compression screw hole 122 passes through the\n     screw hole 116 of the first end portion. In some embodiments, the\n     straight line 136 can bisect the screw hole 116. Aligning the screw hole\n     116 with the longitudinal axis of the compression screw hole 122, which\n     can be generally representative of the direction of movement of the bone\n     plate when a screw is inserted through the compression screw hole 122,\n     can provide increased compression between bone segments at the osteotomy\n     site while reducing movement of the bone segments relative to one\n     another. In some embodiments, the straight line 136 along the\n     longitudinal axis of the screw hole 122 can define an angle .theta. of\n     from about 10 degrees to about 45 degrees with a vertical reference, such\n     as vertical line 138 bisecting the screw hole 124. In some embodiments,\n     the angle .theta. can be about 25 degrees.\n[0049] Referring again to the straight line 138, line 138 can extend in\n     the direction of a length dimension L of the bone plate and can bisect\n     the screw hole 124 of the second end portion. As illustrated in FIG. 14,\n     each of the screw holes 116, 118, 120 of the first end portion can be\n     offset from the straight line 138 along the X-axis. In the illustrated\n     embodiment, each of the screw holes 116, 118, 120 of the first end\n     portion are offset from the straight line 138 along the X-axis in the\n     same direction (to the right in FIG. 14) such that all of the screw holes\n     of the first end portion are on the same side of line 138 as one another.\n     However, it should be understood that in left-handed configurations of\n     the bone plate (see, e.g., FIG. 23), the screw holes of the first end\n     portion can be offset from a straight line bisecting the screw hole 124\n     along the X-axis in the opposite direction (e.g., to the left).\n[0050] In the illustrated embodiment, a longitudinal axis 146 of the\n     compression screw hole 126 can be oriented in a direction away from the\n     first end portion 102, as shown in FIG. 14. This can provide additional\n     compression of the osteotomy site and rotation of the bone plate and/or\n     of the bone segments in a counterclockwise direction upon fixation of the\n     bone plate to the bone to improve the stability of the joint. In the\n     illustrated embodiment, the longitudinal axis 146 of the compression\n     screw hole 126 can define an angle .alpha. of from about 20 degrees to\n     about 60 degrees as measured with respect to a vertical reference, such\n     as line 138. In some embodiments, the angle .alpha. can be from about 30\n     degrees to about 50 degrees. In some embodiments, the angle .alpha. can\n     be about 40 degrees.\n[0051] In some embodiments, the bone plate 100 can have an outer plate\n     contour (e.g., medial or lateral) such that overhang of a long bone to\n     which the bone plate is affixed is reduced or prevented. Reducing\n     overhang can be important to avoid soft tissue impingement, which can\n     result in reduced range of motion and pain post-operatively. For example,\n     in some embodiments, the ratio of the radius R.sub.1 of an outer edge 135\n     of the bone plate and the radius R.sub.2 of an inner edge 137 (see FIG.\n     16) can be from about 1.01 to about 4 along the length of the bone plate.\n     The bone plate can also be made in left or right configurations to\n     accommodate long bones on different sides of the body. For example, the\n     bone plate illustrated in FIG. 14 is a right-handed configuration. A bone\n     plate in a left-handed configuration is illustrated in FIG. 23.\n[0052] With reference to FIG. 15, the bone plate 100 can have an upper\n     surface 106 and a lower surface 108, with the lower surface 108 being\n     adjacent the surface of a bone on which the bone plate is placed. Many\n     conventional bone plates are contoured for a fit in which a large\n     proportion of the surface area of the bone plate is in contact with the\n     surface of the bone to which it is affixed. In contrast, the bone plate\n     embodiments disclosed herein can be contoured such that only a small\n     proportion of the surface area of the bone plate is in contact with the\n     underlying bone, while maintaining a low profile to aid with skin closure\n     over the bone plate. For example, in the embodiment shown, the lower\n     surface 108 is V-shaped in cross-section, in which respective angled\n     portions of the lower surface define an angle .beta. of from about 90\n     degrees to about 170 degrees and converge at an apex 142. In some\n     embodiments, the angle .beta. can be from about 120 degrees to about 170\n     degrees. In some embodiments, the angle .beta. can be about 155 degrees.\n     By angling the lower surface 108 in the shape of a V, contact with the\n     surface of the bone can be minimized to reduce damage to the periosteum\n     and allow blood flow to the bone, while reducing issues with tissue\n     closure over the bone plate. This can promote improved healing of the\n     bone since the periosteum contains fibroblasts and progenitor cells that\n     develop osteoblasts for maintaining and healing bone.\n[0053] In some embodiments, both the upper surface 106 and the lower\n     surface 108 can have V-shaped cross-sections. In other embodiments, the\n     upper surface 106 can be relatively level, or rounded, while only the\n     lower surface 108 has an angled cross-section. In some embodiments, the\n     apex 142 can be located at or near the center of the recessed portion\n     132, and can be continuous along the length of the bone plate such that\n     the entirety of the bone plate and/or the lower surface has a V-shaped\n     cross-section. In other embodiments, the apex 142 can be proximally or\n     distally offset from the center of the recessed portion 132, or can be\n     continuous along only a portion of the length of the bone plate. The bone\n     plate can also be relatively thin, such that the overlying tissue can be\n     closed over the bone plate without undue tension.\n[0054] In some embodiments, the lower surface 108 can include a plurality\n     of standoffs or protrusions to further reduce contact between the bone\n     plate and the surface of the underlying bone. For example, with reference\n     to FIGS. 16 and 17, the lower surface can include three protrusions\n     110A-110C, which can provide three points of contact to establish a\n     primary plane for reconstruction. In the representative embodiment of\n     FIG. 16, the protrusion 110A can extend from the lower surface of the\n     proximal lobe 128, the protrusion 110B can extend from the lower surface\n     of the distal lobe 130, and the protrusion 110C can extend from the\n     distal end of the second end portion 104. In this manner, when the bone\n     plate is affixed to a bone, the protrusions 110A-110C can be the primary\n     points of contact between the bone plate and the bone surface, thereby\n     reducing damage to the periosteum. The protrusions 110A-110C can have a\n     diameter D and a height dimension H, as shown in FIG. 17. In a\n     representative embodiment, the protrusions can have a diameter of about 2\n     mm and a height of about 1 mm, although it should be understood that the\n     protrusions can have any suitable size and/or shape. Additionally, it\n     should be understood that the bone plates disclosed herein are not\n     limited to three protrusions, but can have any suitable number of\n     protrusions, including no protrusions, as desired.\n[0055] In some embodiments, the bone plate 100 can be curved in multiple\n     planes to maintain a geometry capable of placement within the boundaries\n     of a bone following an osteotomy. For example, in addition to the\n     curvature of the bone plate 100 in the X-Y plane as shown in FIG. 14, the\n     bone plate can also be curved along the Z-axis out of the X-Y plane, as\n     shown in FIG. 18. More specifically, in the illustrated embodiment, the\n     first end portion 102 can be angled in the Z-direction to allow the first\n     end portion to conform to the shape of the proximal or distal portion of\n     a bone to which the bone plate is applied. In some embodiments, a plane\n     defined by the lower surface 108 of the first end portion 102 can define\n     an angle .phi. with a plane defined by the lower surface of the second\n     end portion 104 of from about 5 degrees to about 40 degrees. In some\n     embodiments, the angle .phi. can be from about 15 degrees to about 40\n     degrees. In some embodiments, the angle .phi. can be about 25 degrees.\n     The angle .phi. may be varied from application to application, including\n     by being bent to a desired angle by a surgeon during an osteotomy\n     procedure, as required.\n[0056] The screw holes of the bone plate can be configured for use with\n     locking screws, non-locking screws, or combinations thereof, which can be\n     driven into a bone to secure the plate to the bone. In some embodiments,\n     the bone plate 100 can be used in combination with one or more locking\n     bone screws, which can provide a locking feature in the head of the screw\n     that locks or engages the screw with the bone plate when the screw is\n     inserted into the bone. In some embodiments, using locking screws can\n     help prevent the bone plate from being compressed against the bone and\n     damaging the periosteum. Certain embodiments of locking screws that may\n     be used in combination with the bone plates described herein are\n     disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,696,715, which is incorporated herein by\n     reference.\n[0057] FIGS. 19A and 19B illustrate the use of a representative embodiment\n     of a locking screw 150 in combination with the bone plate 100. FIG. 19B\n     illustrates a cross-section X-X taken through screw hole 124 of the bone\n     plate 100 illustrated in FIG. 19A. Generally, locking screws include a\n     head 152 and a threaded body 154 capable of fixation in cancellous or\n     cortical bone. In some embodiments, the screw head 152 can have an\n     external feature (for example, a partial spiral groove) to engage an\n     internal wire (not shown) within the screw hole. This configuration can\n     allow the screw 150 to follow multiple paths through the screw hole into\n     the bone to address variations in the location of optimal bone between,\n     for example, the femur, tibia, and humerus. The free movement of the wire\n     and the diameter of the screw hole can provide for adjustment of the\n     angle of the screw 150 relative to the longitudinal axis 156 of the hole\n     while still providing locking between the screw and bone plate upon final\n     tightening of the screw. This can allow a surgeon to position the screw\n     to target desirable areas of cortical and/or cancellous bone that may not\n     be located directly in line with the longitudinal axis of the screw hole,\n     allowing improved fixation of the bone plate to the bone. In some\n     embodiments, the angle of the screw can vary up to about 12 degrees from\n     the longitudinal axis 156 of the screw hole.\n[0058] This concept is applicable to all of the screw holes and\n     compression screw holes of the bone plate, as illustrated in FIGS.\n     20A-20C and 21A-21B. For example, FIGS. 20A-20C illustrate exemplary\n     regions of a tibia 160 in which screws may be inserted through screw\n     holes 116, 118, and 120 of the first end portion 102 of the bone plate\n     100 in a representative TPLO procedure. In a TPLO procedure, a bone\n     segment 162 may be cut from the proximal portion of the tibia with a\n     radial saw blade. A circle indicated at 164 outlines the path of the\n     osteotomy. Thus, the radially-shaped cut can have a radius substantially\n     equal to a radius of the circle 164.\n[0059] With reference to FIG. 20A, the first end portion 102 of the bone\n     plate is located generally over the bone segment 162, while the second\n     end portion 104 is located generally over the portion of the tibia distal\n     to the osteotomy. FIG. 20B illustrates a plan view of the tibial head and\n     the tibial plateau 163 above a side elevation view of the bone segment\n     162. Lines 1-1, 2-2, and 3-3 indicate cross-sections taken through the\n     transverse plane of the tibia corresponding to the locations of the screw\n     holes 116, 118, 120 on the bone segment 162, with section 1-1 being the\n     cranial-most section and section 3-3 being the caudal-most section. The\n     cross-sections are illustrated in FIG. 20C, where the medial aspect of\n     the tibia is to the right in the figure. The region bounded by lines 165\n     and 166 illustrates the range of angles at which a bone screw can be\n     advanced into the bone segment 162 through the screw hole 118. The region\n     bounded by lines 167 and 168 indicates the range of angles at which a\n     bone screw can be advanced into the bone segment through the screw hole\n     116, and the region bounded by lines 169 and 170 indicates the range of\n     angles at which a bone screw can be advanced into the bone segment\n     through the screw hole 120. In some embodiments, the screws can be\n     advanced into the bone segment at an angle of up to about 12 degrees from\n     the longitudinal axis of the screw hole, allowing the surgeon to target\n     thicker and/or healthier areas of cortical bone for improved fixation, as\n     described above.\n[0060] In some embodiments, the screw hole 116 can be positioned at the\n     geometric center 172 of the circle 164 circumscribing the osteotomy, as\n     illustrated in FIG. 20A. Thus, the straight line 136 (see FIG. 14)\n     bisecting the compression screw hole 122 of the second end portion 104\n     can also pass near or through the geometric center 172 of the osteotomy,\n     which can improve compression applied to the osteotomy by the bone plate\n     and reduce movement of the bone segment 162 after fixation of the bone\n     plate 100. For example, FIG. 21 illustrates a prior art bone plate\n     positioned over a tibia in which the geometric center of the osteotomy\n     does not coincide with the location of a screw hole.\n[0061] FIGS. 22A and 22B illustrate exemplary regions of the tibia 160 in\n     which screws may be inserted through screw holes 122, 124, and 126 of the\n     second end portion 104 of the bone plate. Lines 4-4, 5-5, and 6-6\n     represent cross-sections taken in respective transverse planes of the\n     tibia 160 through the screw holes 122, 124, and 126, respectively. The\n     cross-sections are illustrated in FIG. 22B. The region bounded by lines\n     174 and 175 illustrates the range of angles at which a bone screw can be\n     advanced into the tibia through the compression screw hole 122. The\n     region bounded by lines 176 and 177 indicate the range of angles at which\n     a bone screw can be advanced into the tibia through the screw hole 124,\n     and the region bounded by lines 178 and 179 indicate the range of angles\n     at which a bone screw can be advanced into the tibia through the\n     compression screw hole 126. The screws can be advanced into the bone\n     segment at an angle of up to about 12 degrees from the longitudinal axis\n     of the screw hole, as described above.\n[0062] FIG. 23 illustrates a representative embodiment of the bone plate\n     100 in a left-handed configuration. In the bone plate of FIG. 23, the\n     screw holes 116-126 are also numbered in accordance with an exemplary\n     order in which bones screws can be inserted into the bone. The sequence\n     of use of these holes can be specific to surgical techniques for\n     particular long bone osteotomies. In some embodiments, the objective can\n     be to establish initial fixation between the plate and the bone, then to\n     provide compression to the osteotomy site, and then secure the bone plate\n     and bone together. Each screw hole and compression screw hole can be\n     marked with a number indicating its position in the sequence of screw\n     insertion for a particular operation.\n[0063] For example, in the illustrated embodiment, a screw can be inserted\n     through compression screw hole 122 first to provide fixation of the bone\n     plate to the proximal portion of the bone distal to the osteotomy. As\n     shown in FIG. 23, screw hole 122 can be marked with a "1". Next, a screw\n     can be inserted through the screw hole 120, which can be marked with a\n     "2". A screw can then be inserted through screw hole 116, marked with a\n     "3", to close the osteotomy gap and compress the bone segment against the\n     remainder of the bone. A screw can then be inserted through compression\n     screw hole 126, marked with a "4", to further compress the osteotomy and\n     provide additional resistance to rotation of the bone segment. Next, a\n     screw can be inserted through screw hole 124, marked with a "5", to\n     provide further fixation of the second end portion 104 to the bone. A\n     screw can then be inserted through screw hole 118 marked with a "6" to\n     complete fixation of the bone plate to the bone segment, although it\n     should be understood that insertion of bone screws into the screw holes\n     can be performed in any suitable order depending upon the nature of\n     procedure, etc.\n[0064] It should be understood that the bone plates and methods described\n     herein are applicable to any long bones in canids, as well as in other\n     mammals including felines and humans. More specifically, the ability to\n     adjust the angle of the screws in combination with the V-shaped\n     cross-section can allow the bone plate 100 to be used with a variety of\n     long bones and a variety of osteotomy procedures and/or fractures of\n     those bones. The bone plates described herein can also be used on\n     multiple sides of the body, and at the proximal or distal ends of bones\n     without significant modification, contrary to known bone plates. For\n     example, FIGS. 24, 25, and 26 illustrate use of the bone plate 100 in\n     combination with various long bones, including the proximal lateral,\n     distal medial, and distal lateral aspects of the femur (FIG. 24), the\n     proximal lateral and proximal medial aspects of the humerus (FIG. 25),\n     and the proximal medial aspect of the tibia (FIG. 26).\n[0065] The bone plate embodiments described herein can provide improved\n     initial stability and improved compression at the osteotomy interface,\n     which can yield faster healing in the desired realigned position. In some\n     embodiments, this can be accomplished with a single bone plate family\n     (including multiple sizes) in left and right orientations, as opposed to\n     multiple families of plates with multiple iterations in each family.\n[0066] In some embodiments, the bone plate 100 can be made of any\n     biocompatible metal such as, for example, stainless steel, titanium, etc.\n     In some embodiments, the bone plate 100 can comprise any of various\n     biocompatible polymers or plastics, including polylactic acid, or other\n     aliphatic polymers. When fabricated from polylactic acid, for example,\n     the bone plate can be configured to be naturally resorbed or dissolved by\n     the body after a period of time has elapsed sufficient to allow the\n     osteotomy to heal. For example, in some embodiments the bone plate can be\n     configured to dissolve over a period of from about 8 weeks to about 12\n     weeks.\n[0067] FIGS. 27-31 illustrate another embodiment of a multi-directional\n     locking screw and associated screw hole that may be used in combination\n     with the bone plates described herein. FIGS. 27 and 28 illustrate a\n     portion of a bone plate 200 including a screw hole 202 having threads 204\n     adapted to engage the head of a locking screw. The threads 204 can be,\n     for example, female threads, and can be relatively coarse, and can be\n     separated by groove portions 206 such that the threads are discontinuous\n     around the inner circumference of the screw hole. The screw hole 202 can\n     also be tapered such that the circumference of the screw hole decreases\n     in a direction from the top surface 208 to the bottom surface 210 of the\n     bone plate.\n[0068] FIGS. 29 and 30 illustrate a representative embodiment of a locking\n     bone screw 212 configured to be received in the screw hole 202. The screw\n     212 can include a head 214 and a threaded body 216. In some embodiments,\n     the head 214 can be relatively spherical, and can include relatively\n     coarse threads 218 (e.g., male threads) to engage the threads 204 of the\n     screw hole 202 in the bone plate. In some embodiments, the threads of the\n     body 216 can be have a relatively larger diameter to increase the\n     strength of fixation to the bone.\n[0069] With reference to FIGS. 30 and 31A-31C, the screw 212 can be\n     movable within the screw hole 202 such that an angle .theta. defined by a\n     longitudinal axis of the screw with reference to a longitudinal axis of\n     the screw hole 202 can vary. For example, in some embodiments, the angle\n     .theta. can be up to about 12 degrees with respect to the longitudinal\n     axis of the screw hole. FIG. 31A illustrates the screw 212 angulated to\n     the left with respect to the longitudinal axis of the screw hole, FIG.\n     31B illustrates the screw aligned with the longitudinal axis of the screw\n     hole, and FIG. 31C illustrates the screw angulated to the right with\n     respect to the longitudinal axis of the screw hole.\n[0070] As used herein, the term "long bone" refers to a bone that has a\n     length dimension greater than its diameter or width, and including, for\n     example, the tibia, the femur, and the humerus.\n[0071] As used herein, the term "proximal" refers to a direction toward\n     the point of origin or attachment, frequently toward the center of the\n     body.\n[0072] As used herein, the term "distal" refers to a direction away from\n     the point of origin or attachment, frequently away from the center of the\n     body.\nGeneral Considerations\n[0073] For purposes of this description, certain aspects, advantages, and\n     novel features of the embodiments of this disclosure are described\n     herein. The disclosed methods, apparatus, and systems should not be\n     construed as being limiting in any way. Instead, the present disclosure\n     is directed toward all novel and nonobvious features and aspects of the\n     various disclosed embodiments, alone and in various combinations and\n     sub-combinations with one another. The methods, apparatus, and systems\n     are not limited to any specific aspect or feature or combination thereof,\n     nor do the disclosed embodiments require that any one or more specific\n     advantages be present or problems be solved.\n[0074] Although the operations of some of the disclosed embodiments are\n     described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation,\n     it should be understood that this manner of description encompasses\n     rearrangement, unless a particular ordering is required by specific\n     language set forth below. For example, operations described sequentially\n     may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently. Moreover, for\n     the sake of simplicity, the attached figures may not show the various\n     ways in which the disclosed methods can be used in conjunction with other\n     methods. Additionally, the description sometimes uses terms like\n     "provide" or "achieve" to describe the disclosed methods. These terms are\n     high-level abstractions of the actual operations that are performed. The\n     actual operations that correspond to these terms may vary depending on\n     the particular implementation and are readily discernible by one of\n     ordinary skill in the art.\n[0075] As used in this application and in the claims, the singular forms\n     "a," "an," and "the" include the plural forms unless the context clearly\n     dictates otherwise. Additionally, the term "includes" means "comprises."\n     Further, the terms "coupled" and "associated" generally mean\n     electrically, electromagnetically, and/or physically (e.g., mechanically\n     or chemically) coupled or linked and does not exclude the presence of\n     intermediate elements between the coupled or associated items absent\n     specific contrary language.\n[0076] In some examples, values, procedures, or apparatus may be referred\n     to as "lowest," "best," "minimum," or the like. It will be appreciated\n     that such descriptions are intended to indicate that a selection among\n     many alternatives can be made, and such selections need not be better,\n     smaller, or otherwise preferable to other selections.\n[0077] In the following description, certain terms may be used such as\n     "up," "down," "upper," "lower," "horizontal," "vertical," "left,"\n     "right," and the like. These terms are used, where applicable, to provide\n     some clarity of description when dealing with relative relationships.\n     But, these terms are not intended to imply absolute relationships,\n     positions, and/or orientations. For example, with respect to an object,\n     an "upper" surface can become a "lower" surface simply by turning the\n     object over. Nevertheless, it is still the same object.\n[0078] Some of the Figures provided herein include an orientation system\n     that designates the X-axis, the Y-axis, and the Z-axis that are\n     orthogonal to each other. In a majority of these Figures, the Z-axis is\n     oriented out of the page. It should be understood that the orientation\n     system is merely for reference and can be varied. For example, the X-axis\n     can be switched with the Y-axis and/or the stage assembly 10 can be\n     rotated. Moreover, these axes can alternatively be referred to as first,\n     second, or third axes. For example, the X-axis can be referred to as the\n     first axis, the Y-axis can be referred to as the second axis, and the\n     Z-axis can be referred to as the third axis.\n[0079] In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of\n     the disclosed technology may be applied, it should be recognized that the\n     illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples and should not be\n     taken as limiting the scope of the disclosure. Rather, the scope of the\n     disclosure is defined by the following claims.\n* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n',
