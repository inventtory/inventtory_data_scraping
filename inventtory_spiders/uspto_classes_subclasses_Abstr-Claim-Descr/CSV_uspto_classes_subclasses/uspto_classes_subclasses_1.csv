 This disclosure generally relates to display units for vehicles, and more particularly, to an adapter for attachment of a display unit to a console of a vehicle and method of implementing the same.
BACKGROUND
 The ever increasing complexity of aircraft systems has witnessed a corresponding increase of complexity of flight instrumentation used in the cockpits of these aircraft systems.  A solution to this problem has been to implement one or more video
display units in the cockpit such that various flight instruments may be alternatively represented by images on the video display unit.  Using these video display units, the number of individual flight instruments in the cockpit of the aircraft has been
reduced.  A video display unit that has been implemented in a cockpit of an aircraft is commonly referred to as a glass cockpit.
SUMMARY
 In one embodiment, a device includes an adapter having a number of holes and a number of threaded studs.  The holes are arranged in a spaced apart pattern corresponding to a bolt pattern of a legacy cockpit display unit.  The threaded studs are
arranged in a spaced apart pattern similar to a bolt pattern of a display unit.
 In another embodiment, a method includes providing an adapter having a number of holes and a number of threaded studs, aligning the holes with a first bolt pattern of a receptacle in the console, mounting the adapter to a console of a vehicle,
aligning holes in the display unit with the threaded studs, and mounting the display unit.  The adapter may be secured to the receptacle and display unit using fasteners such as bolts or screws.
 Some embodiments of the present disclosure may provide numerous technical advantages.  A technical advantage of one embodiment may be to provide a glass display unit for a vehicle such as an aircraft that is generally less expensive than
previously known implementations.  One previous approach has been to redesign the cockpit in order to accept display units.  This approach may nevertheless incur significant costs due to stringent prove-in requirements of the new cockpit design.  Certain
embodiments may thus provide advantage over this as well as other approaches in that a generally inexpensive adapter may be implemented to allow retrofitting a display unit to a console of a vehicle with relatively lower costs than other implementations.
 Although specific advantages have been disclosed hereinabove, it will be understood that various embodiments may include all, some, or none of the disclosed advantages.  Additionally, other technical advantages not specifically cited may become
apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art following review of the ensuing drawings and their associated detailed description BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
 Legacy cockpit display units for aircraft cockpits have been implemented with a generally square-shaped aspect ratio.  The aspect ratio is generally referred to as the ratio of the width to the height of the display portion of a display unit. 
The square-shaped aspect ratio has been conventionally adopted by the aircraft industry for several reasons.  For example, these display units have been implemented to replace one or more flight instruments such as generally round-shaped dials or
indicators on the console of the aircraft.  The legacy cockpit display unit would be configured to display a representation of the instrument on the display and could be easily configured to alternatively display a representation of another instrument at
the desire of the user or pilot.  Thus, the legacy cockpit display unit has served to replace many of the plethora of flight instrumentation in the aircraft cockpit.
 The display unit having a display with a square-shaped aspect ratio would most easily accommodate a round-shaped instrument.  The aircraft industry has generally adopted this generally square-shaped aspect ratio for displays of legacy cockpit
display units.  Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated (ARINC) is an organization that has established various guidelines and standards to be used with various types of components that may be implemented on aircraft systems.  Of these guidelines, Aeronautical
Radio, Incorporated has established guidelines regarding the dimensional aspects of display units.  Thus, industrial convention as well as the type of images displayed on the display unit has led the aircraft industry to adopt display units having
generally square-shaped aspect ratios.
 Other industries, such as the general consumer industry, have adopted industry standards for display units that differ from the aircraft industry.  For example, display units having aspect ratios of 4:3 or 16:9 have been developed in order to
conform to various consumer devices, such as conventional television equipment.  The relatively large market provided by these non-square aspect ratio designs has enabled use of display units that are comparable in quality and less expensive to produce
than legacy cockpit display units having a generally square-shaped aspect ratio.  Thus, the teachings of the present disclosure recognize that it would be beneficial to provide a display unit that may be retrofitted to a vehicle cockpit having a
receptacle that is adapted to accept a legacy cockpit display unit.
 FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of an adapter 10 that may be implemented to provide attachment of a display unit 12 to a console 14 of a vehicle.  Adapter 10 generally includes a number of holes 16 and a number of threaded studs 18.  The holes
16 provide for attachment of the adapter 10 to a console 14 of a vehicle, and the threaded studs 18 provide for attachment of the adapter 10 to a display unit, which may be an industry standard display unit 12 in one embodiment.  As described in greater
detail below, the adapter 10 may provide for reciprocal attachment of display unit 12 to console 14 of a vehicle by disposing the adapter in between the console 14 and the display unit 12.  Thus, certain embodiments may provide an advantage in that a
commercially available display unit 12 may be provided for attachment to a console 14 that is adapted for use with legacy cockpit display units.
 Adapter 10 may have any shape that maintains holes 16 in a fixed spaced apart relation to threaded studs 18.  In this manner, display unit 12 may be rigidly secured in console 14.  In one embodiment, the adapter 10 may made of any generally
rigid material, such as metal or thermoplastic having a generally flat shape.  In one embodiment, the adapter 10 may be formed from one piece.  In this particular embodiment, adapter may have an aperture 20 sufficient in size to allow insertion of a
display unit 12.  In another embodiment, adapter 10 may be formed in two pieces in which each piece is has two holes 16 and two threaded studs 18.  In yet another embodiment, adapter 10 may be formed in four pieces in which each piece has one hole 16 and
one threaded stud 18.
 Console 14 may have one or more receptacles 22 for attachment of one or more corresponding legacy cockpit display units (not specifically shown).  Each receptacle 22 may include a number of threaded holes 26.  Threaded holes 26 are spaced apart
over the console 14 in a particular spaced apart pattern that is similar to a bolt pattern of a conventional legacy cockpit display.  In one embodiment, the bolt pattern may be four threaded holes 26 that are arranged in a rectangular fashion relative to
one another.  In another embodiment, the bolt pattern of the threaded holes 26 may be specified according to dimensions established by Aeronautical Radio, Incorporated (ARINC).  Holes 16 in adapter 10 may be disposed in any spaced apart pattern that
provides for attachment to receptacle 22.  In one embodiment, holes 16 may be arranged in a spaced apart pattern that is similar to bolt pattern of threaded holes 26.  In this manner, the adapter 10 may be attached to receptacle 22 using fasteners 24
such as screws that extend through holes 16 and are secured in threaded holes 26.
 Display unit 12 has a generally box-shaped electrical circuit enclosure portion 28 and a display head portion 30.  Display head portion 30 has a generally non-square shaped display glass 32.  In one embodiment, display glass 32 may have any
aspect ratio that is generally non-square is shape, such as a display glass having a 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio.  Display head portion 30 has a number of display head holes 34 arranged in a particular bolt pattern.  In this particular embodiment, the bolt
pattern incorporates a quantity of four display head holes 34 that are implemented on either corner of the display head portion 30 and are arranged in a rectangular fashion.
 Although the previously described display unit 12 is described with a particular bolt pattern, it should be appreciated that other embodiments of display units 12 may have other bolt patterns.  Threaded studs 18 may be disposed in adapter 10 in
any spaced apart pattern that provides for attachment of display unit 12 to adapter 10.  In one embodiment, threaded studs 18 may be arranged in a spaced apart pattern that is similar to bolt pattern of display head holes 34.  The display unit 12 may be
attached to adapter using fasteners 36, such as screws that extend through display head holes 34 and are secured in threaded studs 18.
 In one embodiment, threaded studs 18 may be disposed in the adapter 10 relative to the holes 16 such that two of the displays 12 may be attached in a console having two receptacles 22.  The console 14 may have two receptacles 22 for attachment
of two legacy cockpit display units as shown in FIG. 1.  However, a suitably sized display unit 12 may have a width that is greater than the width of a legacy cockpit display unit due to its aspect ratio.  An enlarged elevational view of two adapters 10
that may be disposed in a side-by-side arrangement are shown in FIG. 2.
 In one embodiment, threaded studs 18 may incorporate a lateral offset 40 relative to holes 16 to enable attachment of two display units 12 in this side-by-side arrangement.  The lateral offset 40 is shown in FIG. 2 wherein the spaced apart
pattern of the threaded studs 18 has been shifted laterally with respect to the spaced apart pattern of holes 16.  In this manner, two display units 12 may be attached in a side-by-side configuration in console 14 having two receptacles 22 arranged in a
side-by-side configuration.
 In another embodiment, display unit 12 may have a display head portion 30 and an electrical circuit enclosure portion 28 that may be physically separate from one another as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 respectively.  Display head portion 30 and
electrical circuit enclosure portion 28 are physically separated so that they may be separately attached to console 14.  As shown in FIG. 4, adapter 10 may be integrally attached to the electrical circuit enclosure portion 28.  In this particular
embodiment, electrical circuit enclosure portion 28 may be attached to console 14 independently of display head portion 30.
 FIG. 5 shows a sequence of acts that may be performed in order to attach display unit 12 to receptacle 22.  In act 100, the method is initiated.  In act 102, an adapter 10 and an in display unit 12 as described above may be provided.  Adapter 10
may be integrally attached to electrical circuit enclosure portion 28 as shown in FIG. 4 or may be physically separate from the electrical circuit enclosure portion 28 as shown in FIG. 1.  In act 104, holes 16 may be aligned with threaded holes 26 in
console 14.  The adapter 10 may then be secured to console 14 using fasteners 24 in act 106.  In the particular embodiment described above in which the adapter 10 is integrally attached to the electrical circuit enclosure portion 28 as shown in FIG. 4,
the electrical circuit enclosure portion 28 may first be inserted in receptacle 22.
 In act 108, display head holes 34 may be aligned with threaded studs 18.  If the display head portion 30 is physically separate from electrical circuit enclosure portion 28, any cable interconnections of circuitry in electrical circuit enclosure
portion 28 to display head portion 30 may be performed at this point in time.  If the display head portion 30 is integrally attached to electrical circuit enclosure portion 28 as shown in FIG. 1, electrical circuit enclosure portion 28 may first be
inserted through aperture 20.  In act 110, the display unit 12 may be mounted to the adapter using fasteners 36.  In act 112, display unit 12 has been mounted to console 14 and thus may be used by a user of the vehicle in a normal manner.
 An adapter 10 for attachment of a display unit 12 to a console 14 has been described that provides for implementation of commercial off the shelf (COTS) type display units 12 in a console 14 of a vehicle.  Although the foregoing description
disclosed implementation of the adapter 10 in a vehicle that was an aircraft, it should be appreciated that the teachings of the previously described embodiments may be applied to other types of vehicles, such as aircraft, land-based vehicles,
watercraft, as well as military and commercial versions of these vehicle types.  Thus, certain embodiments may provide advantage in that technological innovations that may have been applied to display units 12 may also be implemented for use in vehicles.
 It will be apparent that many modifications and variations may be made to embodiments of the present disclosure, as set forth above, without departing substantially from the principles of the present disclosure.  Therefore, all such
modifications and variations are intended to be included herein within the scope of the present disclosure, as defined in the claims that follow.

 The present invention relates to a lower vehicle-body structure of a vehicle, in which arm members constituting a suspension are supported at a sub frame at a front portion of a vehicle body of an automotive vehicle, for example.
 Conventionally, a lower vehicle-body structure of a vehicle, in which a crush space to absorb a collision impact in a vehicle frontal collision is provided at a front portion of a vehicle body, is known.  Specifically, this kind of lower
vehicle-body structure comprises a pair of front side frames extending in a longitudinal direction at both sides of the front portion of the vehicle body.  The front side frames are configured to easily have a buckling deformation receiving an impact
load caused by the vehicle frontal collision, so that the collision impact in the vehicle frontal collision can be absorbed properly.  The crush space is a space to absorb the collision impact though the buckling deformation of the front side frames. 
Thus, ensuring the crush space to absorb the collision impact sufficiently can prevent the impact load from being transmitted to a vehicle rear.
 In the above-described structure, a power train, such as engine, and the sub frame comprising a suspension cross member are arranged in the above-described crush space.  The suspension cross member supports a suspension member which is arranged
right below or in back of the power train.  Further, the power train and the sub frame are supported or fixed to interconnect both sides of the crush space in a vehicle width direction.
 Since the power train and the like interconnect both sides of the crush space in the vehicle width direction as described above, the front side frames may be restrained from deforming in the vehicle width direction against the impact load from
the vehicle front, so that the sufficient buckling deformation may not be obtained.  Thereby, there is a concern that the crush space to absorb the collision impact sufficiently may not be secured.
 Therefore, some technologies to secure the crush space by separating the power train or the sub frame off the vehicle body in the vehicle frontal collision have been proposed.
 Specifically, some weak portion is provided at a connection portion of the sub frame to the vehicle body, and the sub frame is separated off the vehicle body by this weak portion in the vehicle frontal collision, so that the crush space to
absorb the collision impact sufficiently can be secured (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2004-148960).
 Meanwhile, a structure in which arm members constituting the suspension, such as lower arms, are swingably supported at the sub frame is known as one of the lower vehicle-body structures at the front portion of the vehicle body.
 In this kind of structure, it may be considered, in order to provide effects of reducing the road noise during the vehicle traveling, that the attachment rigidity of the support portion at the rear portion of the arm members is improved by
supporting rear portions of the arm members at both the sub frame and the front side frames.
 However, there is a concern that this supporting of the rear portions of the arm members at both the sub frame and the front side frames may prevent a smooth separation of the sub frame together with the arm members in the vehicle frontal
collision.  Thus, there may be a possibility that the crush space to absorb the collision impact sufficiently is not secured.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention has been devised in view of the above-described matters, and an object of the present invention is to provide a lower vehicle-body structure of a vehicle which can secure the crush space to sufficiently absorb the collision
impact in the vehicle frontal collision, improving the attachment rigidity of the support portion at the arm members.
 According to the present invention, there is provided a lower vehicle-body structure of a vehicle, comprising a pair of front side frames extending in a longitudinal direction at both sides of a front portion of a vehicle body, a sub frame
arranged between the front side frames and supporting a suspension member, a pair of arm members constituting part of the suspension member, a front connecting member swingably supporting a front portion of the arm member at the sub frame, a rear
connecting member swingably supporting a rear portion of the arm member at the sub frame and the front side frame, the rear connecting member comprising a support portion to support the arm member, a first connection portion to connect a connected
portion of the sub frame and the support portion, and a second connection portion to connect a connected portion of the front side frame and the support portion, and a separation mechanism to separate the second connection portion of the rear connecting
member off the front side frame by an impact load from a vehicle front in a vehicle frontal collision.
 Herein, the above-described arm member is one of plural arm members constituting a vehicle suspension, which is located in a lower position and connects a wheel side and the sub frame.  This arm member may be a lower arm of a strut type of
suspension, for example.  Further, the above-described vehicle frontal collision may be a vehicle collision in which a vehicle collides at its entire front face or part of its front face (i.e., an offset collision).
 According to the present invention, the attachment rigidity of the support portion at the arm member can be improved, and the crush space to sufficiently absorb the collision impact in the vehicle frontal collision can be secured.  That is,
connecting the arm member of the suspension to both the sub frame and the front side frame via the rear connecting member can increase the attachment rigidity of the support portion at the rear portion of the arm member.  Accordingly, the road noise
which may generate during the vehicle traveling is reduced, so that conformability of passengers can be improved.  Moreover, separating the sub frame off the front side frame together with the arm member in the vehicle frontal collision can secure the
crush space at the front portion of the vehicle body.  Accordingly, the collision impact in the vehicle frontal collision can be absorbed sufficiently.
 According to an embodiment of the present invention, the second connection portion of the rear connecting member is fastened to the connected portion of the front side frame via a fastening member, and the separation mechanism comprises a
separation promotion portion to promote a downward separation of the fastening member off the connected portion of the front side frame by the impact load from the vehicle front in the vehicle frontal collision.  Herein, it may be preferable that the
above-described separation promotion portion of the separation mechanism comprises a slot-shaped opening portion which is formed at the connected portion of the front side frame to assist the downward separation of the fastening member off the connected
portion of the front side frame.  Thereby, some downward force to separate the sub frame off the front side frame acts on the slot-shaped opening portion in the vehicle frontal collision, so that the second connection portion can be easily separated off
the front side frame.
 According to another embodiment of the present invention, the sub frame comprises a suspension cross member extending in a vehicle width direction and supporting the arm members and a pair of longitudinal members extending in the longitudinal
direction below the front side frames and attached to a front portion of the suspension cross member.  Thereby, part of the collision impact generating in the vehicle frontal collision is absorbed through the buckling deformation of the longitudinal
member, so that the collision impact which may be transmitted to the suspension cross member can be reduced.  Further, the suspension cross member can be separated off the vehicle body by the collision impact reduced by the buckling deformation of the
longitudinal member.  Accordingly, the crush space can be secured, and thereby the collision impact from the vehicle front can be absorbed sufficiently.
 According to another embodiment of the present invention, a resilient member resiliently supporting the arm member is provided at the support portion of the rear connecting member.  Herein, the resilient member may be made from a resilient
material, such as rubber bush.  Thereby, in case the sub frame is rigidly fixed to the front side frame, for example, the resilient member can reduce the road noise which may be transmitted via the arm member.  Accordingly, any resilient member, such as
a rubber bush, may be eliminated in fixing the sub frame to the front side frame, so that the number of parts or assembling steps may be decreased.  Thereby, the costs reduction and the weight reduction can be obtained.
 According to another embodiment of the present invention, the separation mechanism constitutes a first separation mechanism, and a second separation mechanism is further provided, the second separation mechanism being configured to separate a
third connection portion which supports a rear end portion of the sub frame at the vehicle body off the vehicle body by an impact load from the vehicle front in the vehicle frontal collision.  Thereby, the rear end of the sub frame is connected to the
vehicle body, so that the support rigidity of the sub frame can be improved and the sub frame can be easily separated off the vehicle body in the vehicle frontal collision.
 According to another embodiment of the present invention, the second separation mechanism comprises a deformation promotion portion provided between the connected portion of the sub frame and the third connection portion.  Herein, the
deformation promotion portion may be comprised of a bead which is formed on a one-side face of the sub frame or plates which have different thickness and are combined together.  Thereby, the buckling deformation of the sub frame is promoted in the
vehicle frontal collision, and the impact load from the vehicle front is transferred to the downward force through the bucking deformation, so that the third connection portion can be separated off the vehicle body.  Further, some downward force to
separate the sub frame off the front side frame is made act on the second connection portion by the separation of the third connection portion, so that the second connection portion can be separated off the front side frame.  Accordingly, the buckling
deformation of the sub frame is caused, so that the impact load is transferred to some force to separate the sub frame, and thereby the sub frame can be easily separated.
 Other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description which refers to the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

 The sub frame 20, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, comprises a pair of longitudinal members 21, lower crush cans 22 which are connected to front ends of the longitudinal members 21, a front cross member 23 which interconnects both front portions of
the longitudinal members 21 in the vehicle width direction, and a suspension cross member 24 which interconnects both rear ends of the longitudinal members 21 in the vehicle width direction.
 As shown in FIG. 3, the sub frame 20 arranged below the front side frames 11 is fixed to the front side frames 11 via the first connection portion 25, the second connection portion 26, and the fourth connection portion 33, which will be
described later.  Further, the sub frame 20 is fixed to the vehicle body 10 via the third connection portion 27 which will be described later.
 Herein, the sub frame 20 is rigidly fixed to the front side frames 11 and the vehicle body 10 without using any resilient member.

 The lower arm 30 curves and projects inwardly, having a bow shape, and has a support arm 30a which projects inward at its middle portion, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.  This support arm 30a has at its tip a front connection portion 30b (see FIG. 2)
which swingably supports the lower arm 30 at the front portion of the suspension cross member 24.  A rear end of the lower arm 30 is swingably supported at both the fourth connected portion 17 and the fifth connected portion 24a via the rear connecting
member 31.  Herein, a ball joint 35 for connection of a knuckle arm (not illustrated) supporting a wheel is provided at a front end of the lower arm.
 The rear connecting member 31, as shown in FIG. 5, comprises a support portion 32 to support the rear end of the lower arm 30, the fourth connection portion 33 which is positioned on the outward side of the support portion 32, and the fifth

 The fifth connection portion 34 is formed in a flat-plate shape and extends inward from the peripheral face of the support portion 32, and has a bolt through hole 34a extending vertically at a central portion of its tip.  Herein, the fifth
connection portion 34 is fixed to the fifth connected portion 24a of the suspension cross member 24 with a bolt 37.
 Hereinafter, a state of the front portion of the vehicle body having the lower vehicle-body structure described above in the vehicle frontal collision will be described referring to FIGS. 6 and 7.
 FIG. 6 shows the state of the front portion of the vehicle body in an initial stage of the vehicle frontal collision.  FIG. 7 shows the state of the front portion of the vehicle body in a late stage of the vehicle frontal collision.
 In the initial stage of the vehicle frontal collision, as shown in FIG. 6, the upper crush cans 12 and the lower crush cans 22 crush and deform, receiving the impact load from the vehicle front.  Part of the collision impact is absorbed by the
crushing of these crush cans 12, 22.  The reduced collision impact is inputted from the front end of the front ends of the front side frames 11 and the front ends of the longitudinal members 21, then transmitted rearward.
 The impact load from the vehicle front causes buckling deformations of the front side frames 11 and the longitudinal members 21 so that they bend in zigzag, respectively, and get away from each other both in the vertical direction and in the
vehicle width direction.  Herein, the front side frames 11 and the longitudinal members 21 have bead or portions having a relatively small cross section to form some weak portion, so that a manner of the buckling deformation can be controlled properly.
 The above-described buckling deformations of the frost side frames 11 and the longitudinal members 21 cause some force to separate the first connection portion 25 and the second connection portion 26 off the front side frames 11, so that the
first connection portion 25 and the second connection portion 26 are separated off the front side frames 11.
 Moreover, part of the collision impact can be absorbed through the buckling deformation of the front side frames 11 and the longitudinal members 21.
 The rest of collision impact which has not been absorbed through the buckling deformation of the front side frames 11 and the longitudinal members 21 is transmitted from the longitudinal members 21 to the suspension cross member 24.  Herein,
when the impact load from the vehicle front acts on the bead 28 formed at the suspension cross member 24, the suspension cross member 24 bends in a V shape at the bead 28 which is the relatively weak portion.
 This bending of the suspension cross member 24 generates an upward rotational force around the bead 28 at a rear end of the suspension cross member 24.  This rotational force makes the third connected portion 18 and its surrounding portion be
pressed against the rear end of the suspension cross member 2 and then broken.  After this, the rear end of the suspension cross member 24 becomes a support point of a leverage, and the impact load from the vehicle front which acts on the bead 28 causes
a downward rotational force to act on the third connection portion 27.
 The impact load from the vehicle front is further transmitted rearward, and then the downward rotational force acting on the third connection portion 27 causes some force to withdraw the third connection portion 27 together with a bolt 29 and a
nut 18a from the third connected portion 18.  Thereby, the third connected portion gets broken and the nut 18a is withdrawn.  Accordingly, the third connection portion 27 of the sub frame 20 can be separated off the vehicle body 10.
 Further, in the separation process of the third connection portion 27, the downward rotational force with the leverage's support point of the rear end of the suspension cross member 24 also acts on the rear connecting member 31 supporting the
rear portion of the lower arm 30.
 This downward force acts on both the fourth connection portion 33 and the fifth connection portion 34 of the rear connecting member 31.  However, since the bolt through hole 17b of the fourth connected portion 17 is formed in the lens shape as
described above, the fourth connected portion 17 becomes a weaker portion compared with the other portion for the downward force, so that the fourth connected portion 17 may be easily influenced by the downward force compared with the fifth connected
portion 24a.
 Accordingly, the downward force acts on the rear connecting member 31, and the force to withdraw the fourth connection portion 33 together with the bolt 36 and the nut 17a from the fourth connected portion 17 acts, so that the fourth connected
portion 17 gets broken and the nut 17a is withdrawn, and finally the fourth connection portion 33 can be separated off the front side frames 11.
 Accordingly, the sub frame 20 is separated along with the lower arms 30, so that the crush space to absorb the collision impact can be secured.
 As described above, this lower vehicle-body structure of a vehicle comprises a pair of front side frames 11 extending in the longitudinal direction at both sides of the front portion of the vehicle body 10, the sub frame 20 arranged between the
front side frames 11 and supporting the suspension member, a pair of lower arms 30 constituting part of the suspension member, the front connection portion 30b swingably supporting the front portion of the lower arm 30 at the sub frame 20, the rear
connecting member 31 swingably supporting the rear portion of the lower arm 30 at the sub frame 20 and the front side frame 11, the rear connecting member 31 comprising the support portion 32 to support the lower arm 30, the fifth connection portion 34
to connect the fifth connected portion 24a of the sub frame 20 and the support portion 32, and the fourth connection portion 33 to connect the fourth connected portion 17 of the front side frame 11 and the support portion 32, and the separation mechanism
to separate the fourth connection portion 33 off the front side frame 11 by the impact load from the vehicle front in the vehicle frontal collision.  Accordingly, the sub frame 20 and the lower arm 30 are separated off the front side frame 11 by the
separation mechanism in the vehicle frontal collision, so that the attachment rigidity of the support portion 32 at the lower arm 30 can be improved and the crush space to absorb the collision impact sufficiently in the vehicle frontal collision can be
secured.
 That is, connecting the lower arm 30 of the suspension to both the sub frame 20 and the front side frame 11 via the rear connecting member 31 can increase the attachment rigidity of the support portion 32 at the rear portion of the lower arm 30. Accordingly, the road noise which may generate during the vehicle traveling is reduced, so that the conformability of passengers can be improved.
 Moreover, separating the sub frame 20 off the front side frame 11 together with the lower arm 30 in the vehicle frontal collision can secure the crush space at the front portion of the vehicle body.  Accordingly, the collision impact in the
vehicle frontal collision can be absorbed sufficiently.
 Further, since the separation mechanism comprises the bolt through hole 17b (separation promotion portion) to assist the separation of the bolt 36 (fastening member) fastening the fourth connection portion 33 to the fourth connected portion 17
off the front side frame 11, the downward force to separate the sub frame 20 off the front side frame 11 acts on the bolt through hole 17b in the vehicle frontal collision, so that the fourth connection portion 33 can be easily separated off the front
side frame 11.
 Also, since the sub frame 20 comprises the suspension cross member 24 extending in the vehicle width direction and supporting the lower arms 30 and a pair of longitudinal members 21 extending in the longitudinal direction below the front side
frames 11 and attached to the front portion of the suspension cross member 24, part of the collision impact in the vehicle frontal collision is absorbed through the buckling deformation of the longitudinal members 21, so that the collision impact which
may be transmitted to the suspension cross member 24 can be reduced.  Further, the suspension cross member 24 can be separated off the vehicle body 10 by the collision impact reduced by the buckling deformation of the longitudinal members 21. 
Accordingly, the crush space can be secured, and thereby the collision impact from the vehicle front can be absorbed sufficiently.
 Moreover, since the rubber bush 32a resiliently supporting the lower arm 30 is provided at the support portion 32, even in case the sub frame 20 is rigidly fixed to the front side frame 11, the rubber bush 32a can reduce the road noise which may
be transmitted via the lower arm 30.  Accordingly, any resilient member, such as the rubber bush, may be eliminated in fixing the sub frame 20 to the front side frame 11, so that the number of parts or assembling steps may be decreased.  Thereby, the
costs reduction and weight reduction can be provided.
 Further, the above-described separation mechanism constitutes a first separation mechanism, and a second separation mechanism is further provided, the second separation mechanism being configured to separate the third connection portion 27 which
supports the rear end portion of the sub frame 20 at the vehicle body 10 off the vehicle body 10 in the vehicle frontal collision.  Thereby, the rear end of the sub frame 20 is connected to the vehicle body 10, so that the support rigidity of the sub
frame 20 can be improved and the sub frame 20 can be easily separated off the vehicle body 10 in the vehicle frontal collision.
 Also, since the above-described second separation mechanism comprises the bead 28 provided between the fifth connected portion 24a of the sub frame 20 and the third connection portion 27, the buckling deformation of the sub frame 20 is promoted
in the vehicle frontal collision, and the impact load from the vehicle front is transferred to the downward force through the bucking deformation, so that the third connection portion 27 can be separated off the vehicle body 10.
 Further, the downward force to separate the sun frame 20 off the front side frame 11 is made act on the fourth connection portion 33 by the separation of the third connection portion 27, so that the fourth connection portion 33 can be separated
off the front side frame 11.  Accordingly, the buckling deformation of the sub frame 20 is caused, so that the impact load is transferred to the force to separate the sub frame 20, and the sub frame 20 can be easily separated.
 The lower arm of the present invention corresponds to the lower arm 30 of the embodiment.  Likewise, the front connecting member corresponds to the front connection portion 30b, the connected portion of the front side frame corresponds to the
fourth connected portion 17, the connected portion of the sub frame corresponds to the fifth connected portion 24a, the first connection portion corresponds to the fifth connection portion 34, the second connection corresponds to the fourth connection
portion 33, the slot-shaped opening portion corresponds to the bolt through hole 17b (separation promotion portion), the fastening member corresponds to the bolt 36, the resilient member corresponds to the rubber bush 32a, and the deformation promotion
portion corresponds to the bead 28.  The present invention should not be limited to the above-described embodiment, and any other modifications and improvements may be applied within the scope of a sprit of the present invention.
 For example, the bolt through hole 17b (separation promotion portion) may be formed in another kind of shape illustrated in FIG. 4B, or a piece or something to break the fourth connected portion 17 may be further provided.
 Further, while the weak portion is comprised of the bead 28, it may be formed by constituting an upper-face plate of the suspension cross member 24 which has a thinner thickness compared with its bottom-face plate.

 This Application claims priority to German Application No. DE 102011056016.5 filed on Dec.  5, 2011 in Germany and is herein incorporated by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The invention relates to a trim panel for the body of a motor vehicle.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Trim panels for the bodies of motor vehicles are known.  They serve to visually and aerodynamically bridge gaps between different outer skin parts of the body.  In addition, they serve as support structure for functional components such as for
example a seal.  A typical application example is the pillar panel, which covers the load-bearing bodywork parts of the A, B, C or D-pillar.  Another example is the frame-like trim panel in the region of the windscreen opening of the body.
 The requirements on trim panels, in particular on the surface quality on the outside, i.e. the visible side, are very high because of their function which co-shapes the vehicle outside, visually.  A very high surface quality is demanded, wherein
the surface is to be additionally embodied to be impact and scratch resistant as well as weather and aging-resistant.  Apart from this, the material of the trim panel must be employable over a large temperature range and must only have minor
temperature-related distortion values.  On the other hand, ductile-elastic characteristics are demanded for certain functions, namely in particular, where the material interacts with the body, for example in order to realize snap hooks, which are to
resiliently engage behind the vehicle body or of regions, into which the thread-shaping or thread-cutting screws are to cut.
 For the aforementioned reasons, trim panels were developed in the past, which are produced from thermoplastics by a multi-component injection molding method.  There, the portions of the trim panels located towards the non-visible side, which
frequently have a load-bearing function, are produced from a sufficiently ductile material such as for example from ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene).  By contrast, the portions located on the visible side of the trim panels are produced from a
material which makes possible a very high surface quality (""class A"") even without reworking.  Used for example is a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate).
 Such a construction however requires a high material strength of the trim panel, which in particular is due to the sufficiently known restrictions of the thermoplastic injection molding.  Added to this is that in the case of cross-sectional
chunks or material accumulations in the injection-molded trim panels, such as are typical for example in the region of the attachments of stiffening ribs, it has to be ensured with elaborate measures that as a consequence of the higher absolute shrinkage
during the cooling of the material at this location with material accumulation, no subsidence locations develop on the surface of the visible side directed to the outside.
 Starting out from this prior art, the invention is based on the object of providing a trim panel for the body of a motor vehicle, with which the disadvantages described above can be largely eliminated.  In particular, the trim panel may include
a design-appropriate embodiment preferably without production-related restrictions and has high-quality visual characteristics and a low weight.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 A trim panel according to the invention for the body of a motor vehicle, in particular a panel for the A, B, C, D-pillar of the body or for the windscreen-roof frame wherein the trim panel includes a basic body, which in a particular
configuration can also represent the entire trim panel, which is produced from a thermosetting plastic and is formed of a thermosetting plastic.
 The use according to the invention of one or a plurality of thermosetting plastics (preferentially 1-component) for forming the basic body of the trim panel has a multiplicity of advantages.  In addition to the favorable process ability of
thermosetting plastics also within the scope of a large series production, in particular through injection molding and pressing (including all sub and mixed forms of these methods, in particular injection stamping), in particular the following advantages
must be emphasized: thermosetting plastics can be adjusted with respect to their viscosity and their adhesive tendency in a wide range, as a result of which the production in particular within the scope of the abovementioned methods is simplified.  Added
to this is the favorable controllability of the hardening of the material, as a result of which, other than with the cooling of hardening thermoplastics, even thin and large-area components can be produced by injection-molding and/or pressing without
problems.  This makes thus possible the production of trim panels that are comparatively thin relative to conventional trim panels of thermoplastics.  Restrictions of the material thickness materialize only through the required mechanical strength of the
component and less through limits already posed by the production process.  The component weight can be reduced and the aerodynamic characteristics of the body provided with said component can be positively influenced through design measures, which a
designer was not able to use in the past.  This can also have a positive effect visually, for example through a more surface-flush appearance.  The high density of the thermosetting plastic can additionally improve the haptic and the acoustic behavior of
the trim panel.  Thermosetting plastics additionally have a very low distortion tendency in many instances, which makes possible the production of almost distortion-free trim panels.  In addition, thermosetting plastics are characterized by a low
post-shrinkage, which are particularly advantageous with respect to passing alternating climate tests, to which motor vehicles are exposed within the scope of the development.  Through the positive shrinkage characteristics, a wall thickness-rib ratio
can be additionally changed in the direction of 1:1, as a result of which sturdy trim panels with low weight can be produced.  Added to this are a very low expansion during heat storage and almost continuous mechanical characteristics in the temperature
range of -40.degree.  C. to 150.degree.  C. that is relevant for motor vehicle bodies.  Furthermore, many thermosetting plastics are characterized by low material costs, which lower the component costs.  Added to this is that sealing foams or other
elements in many cases favorably adhere to the thermosetting plastic even without additional process steps.
 In a preferred embodiment of the trim panel according to the invention, the basic body is at least partially or completely produced from BMC (bulk molding compound) or SMC (sheet molding compound), in particular in the form of so-called low
profile or low shrinkage molding compounds.  These plastic fiber composites include thermosetting plastics and may include further filling materials for a specific characteristic modulation and which are frequently present in the form of molding
compounds that are similar to plasticine.  The compounds make possible the cost-effective production of trim panels within the scope of the abovementioned methods for large series production, i.e. in particular by means of injection molding or pressing,
including all sub and mixed forms of these methods, in particular injection stamping.  The methods produce parts with simultaneously high mechanical strengths (among other things because of the fiber reinforcement) and favorable surface characteristics
(""class A"" surfaces).
 The use of thermosetting plastics for producing the trim panel or the basic body of the trim panel according to the invention makes possible in particular the advantageous production of components which with respect to conventional trim panels
of thermoplastics can be embodied very thinly.  It has proved to be advantageous if the thickness of the areal portions of the basic body, i.e. such portions without reinforcements, transitions, etc., does not amount to substantially more than 3 mm and
preferentially not more than approximately 2 mm.  Because of this, in conjunction with the mechanical strengths of the thermosetting plastics and in particular of BMC or SMC, a trim panel can be created, which despite relatively low wall thickness has a
strength that is adequate for non-load bearing components of the outer skin of a body.  With a wall thickness of approximately 2 mm, the wall thickness of conventional trim panels, which amounts to approximately 4 mm, can be reduced by up to 50%.
 The advantageous characteristics of thermosetting plastics, which make possible the production of particularly thin areal components also in the mentioned methods for the large series production, also make possible a preferred configuration of
the basic body such that the latter tapers towards the edge in at least one edge region.  Because of this, the possibility of an aerodynamically and also visually advantageous configuration of the trim panel is created for a configuration becoming
thinner towards the edge cannot only positively influence the aerodynamics, for example in the form of a preferably low separation edge, but also improves the possibilities for realizing as surface-flush an appearance of the body as possible.  With a
view to the advantageous aerodynamic characteristics that can be achieved, such a taper should be provided in particular for such edges of the trim panel which by forming a step-like shoulder to the adjoining vehicle surface, in particular to the
adjoining window surface, constitute a flow separation edge on which wind noises or turbulences can undesirably occur.  It is pointed out that such a material thickness tapering cannot be realized with conventional trim panels from thermoplastics,
because on the one hand the material strength of thermoplastics does not permit such a reduction of the material thickness and because on the other hand the necessary low spacing of the injection mold jaws necessary for such a material thickness
reduction is problematic on account of the cooling of the injection molding compound that is too rapid with the injection molding process.  The chemically hardening molding compounds provided for the trim panels according to the invention ensure a
uniform molded part filling in the injection molding process even with low wall thicknesses, in part due to a favorable flow behavior within the tool.
 The tapered edge region of the trim panel can for example be achieved through an angled-off and/or arch-shaped curve of a side of the basic body serving as a visual side of the trim panel.
 Furthermore, the basic body of the trim panel can be provided with a coating in at least one portion, which in particular can be designed in the form of a paint layer and/or in addition to a paint layer, can comprise further layers such as for
example a priming layer.  This makes possible the color coating matched to the remaining outer skin parts of the body, provided the desired color coding cannot already be achieved through suitable filler materials.  Thus, even minute color deviations
relative to the body paintwork later on can be avoided.  Particularly preferably, a high-gloss black paint coating may be employed as a coating.  Since the coating of the basic body, in particular with a paint layer, because of the corrosion resistance
of the thermosetting plastics frequently serves only for visual reasons, it can be preferentially provided to provide the coating on a side of the basic body serving as visible side of the trim panel and in particular only on this visible side.  The
component surface can for example be provided with a paint system such as a urea based, EPS polyester based or polyurethane bases paint system.  Alternatively, the use of thermosetting plastics for forming the basic body of the trim panel according to
the invention can also make possible a through-coloring of the plastic, as a result of which a cost-effective possibility of coloring can be realized.  In an additional preferred embodiment of the trim panel according to the invention it can be provided
to form the thermosetting plastic for forming the basic body in an electrically conductive manner, which can be achieved by admixing electrically conductive filler materials.  Through the electrically conductive compounding, the possibility is created in
particular to coat the trim panel according to the invention, if required jointly with other metallic outer skin components of the body, in an electrostatic coating and in particular painting method in a particularly scratch-resistant manner.
 The trim panel according to the invention can furthermore comprise one or a plurality of functional elements fastened to the basic body.  These can in particular consist of elastomers or also of a liquid silicone and for example serve as sealing
elements and/or elastic spacing members which make possible the vibration-free and low-noise fastening of the trim panel to the body.  The forming of the basic body from thermosetting plastic according to the invention in this case has the advantage that
many elastomers can be fixed to the plastic even without additional process steps or adhesive means.  In addition it offers the possibility of integrating the functional element or functional elements in the basic body within the scope of its production,
as is possible for example within the scope of a multi-component injection molding method. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 FIG. 1 shows a trim panel 1 for the body of a motor vehicle according to the prior art in a cross section.  Concretely, this is a trim panel 1, which exemplarily additionally forms a guide for a vertically displaceable side window 2 of the motor
vehicle and which via fastening elements that are not shown is connected to a support structure of the body.
 The window frame 1 is produced as multi-component injection molding from thermoplastics and comprises a basic body 3 of a tough-ductile thermoplastic (e.g. ABS), which forms the non-visible side of the trim panel 1 and because of its specific
mechanical characteristics, forms holding members of the trim panel 1.  The basic body 3 forms a U-shaped mounting in the wider sense via a web originating on the inside, within which, subject to the intermediate connection of a sealing element inserted
in the mounting, an edge region of the side window 2 is guided.
 Since an injection molding of a tough-ductile thermoplastic is not suitable for the visible side of a trim panel, which does not allow achieving an adequate surface quality and scratch-resistance, the basic body 3 is connected to a covering body
4 of impact-tough rather glass-like thermoplastics (e.g. PMMA).  The latter forms the surfaces which constitute the visible side of the trim panel.  The use of for example PMMA makes possible forming ""class A""-appropriate surfaces directly during
injection molding, i.e. without relevant reworking.  The connection of the two components is preferably realized in the two-component injection molding process.
 The production of the trim panel 1 in the multi-component injection molding process required for visual reasons in conjunction with the material-specific restriction of the minimal thicknesses of the basic body 3 that can be achieved for example
from ABS and of the covering body 4 for example from PMMA results in that such conventional trim panels 1 are currently not produced with a wall thickness ""S"" lower than approximately 4 mm and additionally not with different regions having varying
material thicknesses.  Edges tapering towards the margin as would be desirable for visual and aerodynamic reasons cannot be realized.  Added to this is that the height ""H"" of the step-like transition from the visible side surface of the trim panel 1 to
the surface of the window pane 2 is relatively large, so that in this region undesirable and aerodynamically unfavorable turbulences due to the headwind ""W"" occur.  In addition to this, indentations 5 on the non-visible side have to be provided with such
conventional trim panels in many cases in order to avoid material agglomerations, which, because of the thin uneven shrinkage behavior, could lead to subsidence locations which are noticeable also on the visible side and are therefore unacceptable. 
During the production, these indentations 5 frequently constitute undercuts, which could render de-molding of the components more difficult and unnecessarily complicate an injection molding tool.
 The FIGS. 2 to 4 show three exemplary embodiments of a trim panel.  The features shown in the respective Figures can be realized jointly or in each case individually and are, each taken on its own and also in their entirely as independent
inventions.
 The trim panel 1 of the three embodiments includes a basic body 3, which forms the entire (FIG. 2 and FIG. 4) or almost the entire window frame (FIG. 3).  The basic body 3 was produced from BMC as part of an injection molding process, as a
result of which a component was created that not only has adequate strength to fulfill the load-bearing function of the part but also makes available a ""class A""-appropriate surface quality even without reworking.  Because of this, the trim panel 1, when
colored through with the desired tone of color, can be directly employed as outer skin part of the body or with paint without further coatings provided for improving the surface quality.  FIG. 3 shows such an embodiment of a window frame according to the
invention, in the case of which the basic body 3, if required, after the applying of a prime coat (not shown) was coated with a thin paint layer 6.
 Through the production of the basic body 3 from a glass fiber-permeated thermosetting plastic molding compound a material thickness ""s"" of the window frame can be achieved, which in the areal portions is configured thinner than the counterpart
of thermoplastics known from FIG. 1 (s.quadrature.S applies).  Despite this, an adequate mechanical strength is achieved, namely even with a preferred material thickness of the basic body of approximately 2 mm.  With a coating with a paint layer (see
FIG. 3), the paint layer thickness, which depending on the applied coating method or paint used, can amount up to approximately 500 .mu.m, has to be added so that the overall thickness then amounts to approximately 2.5 mm.  A component that is light
compared with a conventional trim panel and visually more unobtrusive component can be created.  Further, the spacing of the visible side surface from the window surface ""h"" can be significantly reduced (h.quadrature.H applies), namely at least by the
amount by which the material is reduced such as by approximately 2 mm.
 Additionally, because of the substantially non-existing shrinkage behavior of the thermosetting plastic employed, the forming of the indentations 5 in the region of the transverse web attachments frequently required with the conventional trim
panels can be omitted (see relevant locations at the trim panels of FIGS. 2 to 4), as a result of which a de-molding of the component after the production is facilitated and the tool manufacture simplified.
 With the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 4, the marginal region constituting a part of the visible side of the window frame 1 tapers towards the margin to a thickness of approximately 0.4 mm, as a result of which not only an aerodynamic advantage
through the formation of a small separation edge can be achieved (the arrow in FIG. 3 shows the direction of the headwind W), but as surface-flush a transmission from the trim panel 1 to the surface of the window pane 2 as possible which is desired in
many cases for visual reasons, is obtained.  Such a tapering, in the shown example from 2 mm to approximately 1 mm, with favorable technical preconditions to up to 0.5 mm or even 0.4 mm, cannot be realized by the injection molding method with
thermoplastics that harden because of the cooling, since the process-safe entering of the thermoplastics in the injection molding process in such narrow tool gaps with the lengths and surfaces to be produced in this application case cannot be guaranteed. The targeted temperature-controlling of a tool, with which this would be at least theoretically conceivable even with thermoplastics, is no alternative for the production of a cost-effective motor vehicle body component because of the tool expenditure
and the required cycle times.
 Here, the tapering region evidently extends over a length (L) which is longer by a multiple than the material thickness ""s"".  Preferably, L>2.times.s applies, further preferably L>3.times.s applies.
 FIG. 5 shows the window frames 1 of FIGS. 1 to 4 in a lateral view initially for illustration purposes.  There it is evident that it is divided into two portions, which significantly differ in the width.  While the upper, wider portion 7 is a
visible portion of the window frame 1, the lower, narrower portion 8 in the assembled state dips into the breast of the door of the motor vehicle and is therefore is not visible from the outside on the produced motor vehicle.
 With the configuration of the window frame 1 according to the prior art (FIG. 1) it is necessary to provide the covering body 4 serving in particular visual reasons only in the visible portion 7; the lower portion 8 of the trim panel 1 by
contrast merely consists of the basic body 3, which dips into the door breast 9 and in the assembled state is covered by the panel 10 of the vehicle door.  The cross-sectional overlap resulting from this and shown in the longitudinal section of FIG. 6
constitutes a weak point that is subjected to stress peak loads as a result of a notch effect, which increases the fracture tendency of the trim panel 1 at this point and as a consequence can lead to a component failure.
 Such a cross-sectional overlap is not present with the trim panels (FIGS. 2 to 4) according to the invention because of the constant thickness design.  At most, an extremely small cross-sectional overlap can be provided when the visible portion
7 is coated with a paint layer 6 (see FIG. 7).  The notch effect connected with this however is negligible, since the paint layer 6 exclusively serves for visual reasons and other than the covering layer 5 with the trim panel 1 according to the prior art
does not cause any stress peaks as a result of the low layer thickness.
 The design details of the three exemplary embodiments described cannot only be applied merely in the concrete combination disclosed, but these can also be applied in any combination even with any other trim panels according to the invention. 
For example, the embodiment according to FIG. 4 can be provided with a coating (paint layer 6) according to the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3.

 This application claims the priority, under 35 U.S.C.  .sctn.119, of German application DE 10 2010 055 039.6, filed Dec.  17, 2010; the prior application is herewith incorporated by reference in its entirety.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
 The invention relates to a roof construction of a motor vehicle.
 European patent EP 0 845 378 B1 discloses a roof construction of a motor vehicle with a fixed roll bar.  The roof construction furthermore has a roof part which, in a closed position, is positioned between the roll bar and an upper cowl of a
windshield above front seats of the motor vehicle, and which, in an open position, is positioned behind the roll bar in a convertible-top compartment.  The convertible-top compartment, which receives the roof element in the open position, is closed by a
convertible-top compartment cover both in the open position and in the closed position.  The roof element can be shifted from the open position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position beyond the fixed roll
bar via an opening and closing mechanism which, according to this prior art, is formed by a plurality of links.
 It is furthermore known from European patent EP 0 845 378 B1 that the links of the opening and closing mechanism extend beyond the roll bar in the closed position of the roof element.  Corresponding cutouts or recesses in the roll bar, through
which the links of the opening and closing mechanism extend when the roof element is closed, are covered on the outside both in the open position and in the closed position of the roof element by a covering of the roll bar.  According to European patent
EP 0 845 378 B1, a section of the covering, which section extends substantially in the horizontal direction, a ""transverse part"", which covers the roll bar on the outside in the region of a transverse strut both in the closed position of the roof element
and in the open position thereof is assigned to the convertible-top compartment cover and can be shifted together with the convertible-top compartment cover relative to the roll bar during the transfer of the roof element from the open position into the
closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a roof construction of a motor vehicle which overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art devices of this general type, which has a simple roof construction.
 With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention a roof construction of a motor vehicle having an upper cowl of a windshield and a convertible-top compartment.  The roof construction contains a
fixed roll bar, an opening and closing mechanism, and a roof element which, in a closed position, is accommodated in front of the fixed roll bar, namely between the fixed roll bar and the upper cowl of the windshield, and, in an open position, is
accommodated behind the fixed roll bar in the convertible-top compartment and which can be shifted from the open position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position beyond the fixed roll bar via the opening
and closing mechanism.  The roof construction further having a covering with a transverse part and side parts for covering the fixed roll bar on an outside in the open position of the roof element and in the closed position of the roof element.  The side
parts of the covering extend substantially in a vertical direction, and can be shifted at least partially, or at least in sections, relative to the fixed roll bar during a shifting of the roof element from the open position into the closed position and
vice versa from the closed position into the open position.  The transverse part of the covering extends generally in a horizontal direction, and is fastened to the fixed roll bar so as not to be able to be shifted relative thereto.
 According to the invention, side parts of the covering, the side parts extending substantially in the vertical direction, can be shifted at least partially, relative to the roll bar during the shifting of the roof element from the open position
into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position, whereas a transverse part of the covering, which transverse part extends generally in the horizontal direction, is fastened to the roll bar so as not to be able to
be shifted relative thereto.
 In the case of the roof construction according to the invention, side parts of the covering, the side parts extending substantially in the vertical direction, can be shifted at least partially relative to the roll bar, namely during the shifting
of the roof element of the roof construction from the open position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position.  In this case, the transverse part of the covering, which transverse part extends substantially
in the horizontal direction, is fitted fixedly to the roll bar and cannot be shifted relative to the roll bar.
 According to a first advantageous development of the invention, the side parts of the covering can be shifted completely, including curved transition sections thereof to the transverse part of the covering, relative to the roll bar during the
shifting of the roof element from the open position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position.
 According to a first advantageous development of the invention, the side parts of the covering of the roll bar can be shifted completely relative to the roll bar during the shifting of the roof element from the open position into the closed
position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position.  This results in a three-part division of the outer covering of the roll bar, namely into the fixed transverse part and the shiftable side parts.
 According to a second advantageous development of the invention, exclusively curved transition sections of the side parts to the transverse part of the covering can be shifted relative to the roll bar during the shifting of the roof element from
the open position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position.
 According to the second advantageous development of the invention, the side parts of the covering can be shifted only partially relative to the roll bar, namely during the transfer of the roof element from the closed position into the open
position and vice versa from the open position into the closed position, wherein curved transition sections of the side parts, which define a transition of the side parts of the covering to the transverse part, can be shifted.  This development of the
invention results in a five-part division of the covering of the roll bar, namely into two fixed sections of the side parts, a fixed transverse part and two shiftable sections of the side parts, wherein the shiftable sections of the side parts are the
curved transition sections of the side parts.
 Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims.
 Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a roof construction of a motor vehicle, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made
therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 The invention relates to a roof construction 10 of a motor vehicle.
 Preferred exemplary embodiments of the roof construction 10 according to the invention are described in detail with reference to FIGS. 1 to 5b.
 FIG. 1 shows a first exemplary embodiment of the roof construction 10 according to the invention of the motor vehicle, wherein the roof construction 10 which is shown in FIG. 1 has a fixed roll bar 11.
 Furthermore, the roof construction 10 has a roof element 12 which is shown in FIG. 1 in a closed position thereof, wherein, in the closed position, the roof element 12 is positioned between the roll bar 11 and an upper cowl 13 of a windshield 14
above non-illustrated seats of the motor vehicle.
 The roof element 12 of the roof construction 10 according to the invention can be transferred from the closed position, which is shown in FIG. 1, into an open position, wherein, in the open position, the roof element 12 is positioned or put away
in a convertible-top compartment 15 below the roll bar 11.
 The convertible-top compartment 15 is closed by a ""convertible-top compartment cover"" 16 both in the closed position of the roof element 12 and in the open position thereof, wherein the convertible-top compartment cover 16 is open only during
the transfer of the roof element 12 from the closed position into the open position and vice versa from the open position into the closed position.  In the exemplary embodiment shown, a rear window 17 is preferably part of the convertible-top compartment
cover 16.
 In order to shift the roof element 12 from the open position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position, use is made of an opening and closing mechanism 18 which is formed by links 19 and 20 and
shifts the roof element 12 beyond the roll bar 11.  The links 19 and 20 are coupled on one side to the roof element 12 and on the other side to a body section behind the roll bar 11, in particular to the convertible-top compartment 15.
 The roll bar 11 has a substantially U-shaped contour with two lateral side struts running substantially vertically, and with a transverse strut which connects the two side struts and runs substantially horizontally.  In this case, the roll bar
11 is covered on an outside by a covering 21 both in the closed position of the roof element 12 and in the open position, namely both in the region of the longitudinal struts and of the transverse strut of the roll bar 11.
 In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1, side parts 22 of the outer covering 21 of the roll bar 11, the side parts extending substantially in the vertical direction, can be shifted completely, including curved transition sections 23 thereof to a
transverse part 24 of the covering 21, relative to the roll bar 11 during the shifting of the roof element 12 from the open position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position.  Whereas the transverse part 24
of the covering 21, the transverse part 24 extending substantially in a horizontal direction and covering the transverse strut of the roll bar 11 on the outside, is fastened to the roll bar 11, namely so as not to be able to be shifted with respect
thereto.
 Accordingly, during the transfer of the roof element 12 from the open position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position, the complete side parts 22 of the covering 21, including the curved
transition sections 23 to the transverse part 24, are shifted relative to the roll bar 11 and therefore to the fixed transverse part 24 of the covering 21.
 In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1, the side parts 22, including the curved transition sections 23 of the covering 21, are fastened to the convertible-top compartment cover 16 and can be shifted relative to the roll bar 11 via the
convertible-top compartment cover 16 during the shifting of the roof element 12.  The side parts 22, including the curved transition sections 23 thereof, are fitted or fastened to the convertible-top compartment cover 16 in such a manner that the side
parts are preferably not able to be shifted relative to the convertible-top compartment cover 16.
 Accordingly, in the variant embodiment of FIG. 1, the complete side parts 22 of the covering 21 are shifted relative to the roll bar 11 by the shifting of the convertible-top compartment cover 16.  Accordingly, a separate drive is not required
therefor; on the contrary, the drive of the convertible-top compartment cover 16 takes on the shifting of the side parts 22.
 A second exemplary embodiment of a roof construction 10' according to the invention for a motor vehicle is shown in FIG. 2, wherein, in FIG. 2, the same reference numbers as in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1 are used for identical
subassemblies in order to avoid unnecessary repetitions.
 The exemplary embodiment of FIG. 2 differs from the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1 only in that, in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 2, the side parts 22 of the covering 21 for the roll bar 11 cannot be shifted completely, but merely partially,
relative to the roll bar 11 during the shifting of the roof element 12 from the closed position into the open position and vice versa from the open position into the closed position.  In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 2, exclusively the curved
transition sections 23 of the side parts 22 of the covering 21, which transition sections provide the transition between the two side parts 22 and the transverse part 24 of the covering 21, can be shifted in relation to the roll bar 11 during the
shifting of the roof element 12 from the closed position into the open position and vice versa from the open position into the closed position.
 According to FIG. 2, the curved transition sections 23, in turn, are mounted on the convertible-top compartment cover 16, namely in such a manner that, although the transition sections can be shifted in relation to the roll bar 11, they cannot
be shifted relative to the convertible-top compartment cover 16.  The other sections of the side parts 22, and the transverse part 24 are fastened fixedly to the roll bar 11 so as not to be able to be shifted relative thereto.
 Also in the variant embodiment of FIG. 2, a separate drive is not required in order to shift the transition sections 23 of the side parts 22; on the contrary, the convertible-top compartment cover 16, to which the transition sections 23 are
fastened, takes over the shifting of the transition sections.
 FIG. 3 shows a further exemplary embodiment of a roof construction 10'' according to the invention.  In accordance with the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 2, in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, only the curved transition sections 23 of the side
part 22 of the covering 21 of the roll bar 11 can be shifted relative to the roll bar 11 during the shifting of the roof element 12 from the closed position into the open position and vice versa from the open position into the closed position.  However,
the difference over the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 2 is that, in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, the transition sections 23 are not fastened to the convertible-top compartment cover 16 and cannot be shifted relative to the roll bar 11 via the
convertible-top compartment cover.  Rather, in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, the curved transition sections 23 are fastened to the roll bar 11 and can be shifted relative thereto.  The remaining sections of the side parts 22 and the transverse part
24 of the covering 21 are fastened to the roll bar 11 so as not to be able to be shifted.
 FIG. 3 clarifies, by means of an arrow 25, the shifting of the curved transition sections 23, which is visible in FIG. 3, of the side part 22 of the covering 21 relative to the roll bar 11 during the transfer of the roof element 12 from the open
position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position.  According to FIG. 3, the curved transition section 23 is shifted upward in the direction of the transverse part 24 of the covering 21.  However, in
contrast thereto, it is also possible to shift the particular transition section 23 in the opposite direction downward toward those sections of the side parts 22 of the covering 21 which are mounted fixedly on the roll bar 11.
 FIGS. 4A to 5B show various kinematics, with the aid of which the shifting of the transition sections 23 relative to the roll bar 11 can be realized.  The kinematics involve shifting mechanisms in order to shift the transition sections 23 of the
side part 22 of the covering 21 in relation to the roll bar 11.
 In FIGS. 4A and 4B, the curved transition section 23 shown in each case is preferably coupled to the roll bar 11 at a pivot point 26, the transition section 23 being shifted downward in FIG. 4A, and the transition section 23 being shifted upward
in FIG. 4B.
 In FIGS. 5A and 5B ""four-bar linkages"" are formed via two links 27 in each case, wherein two positionally fixed pivot points 28 are assigned in particular to the roll bar 11 and two shiftable pivot points 29 are assigned to the links 27.  The
links 27 are preferably coupled to the roll bar 11 via the positionally fixed pivot points 28 and are coupled to the respective transition section 23 via shiftable pivot points 29.
 Dashed lines in FIGS. 4A to 5B span regions 30 within which the links 19 and 20 of the opening and closing mechanism 18 of the roof element 12 are moved during the transfer of the roof element 12 from the closed position into the open position
and vice versa from the open position into the closed position.
 It can be gathered from FIGS. 4A to 5B that the transition sections 23 can be moved out of the region 30, and therefore the movement of the links 19 and 20 of the opening and closing mechanism 18 of the roof element 12 is not obstructed by the
transition sections 23 during the transfer of the roof element 12 from the open position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position.
 The shifting mechanisms shown in FIGS. 4A to 5B may be assigned a separate drive in order to ensure the shifting of the respective transition section 23 relative to the roll bar 11.  The drive may be configured hydraulically or electrically or
in another manner.
 In contrast thereto, it is also possible not to provide a separate drive for the shifting mechanism of the transition sections 23 but rather to couple the shifting mechanism of the transition sections 23 to the opening and closing mechanism 18
of the roof element 12, i.e. to the links 19 and 20.  In this case, the shifting of the curved transition sections 23 is then taken over by the drive of the opening and closing mechanism of the roof part or roof element 12.
 A common feature of all of the exemplary embodiments shown is that side parts 22 of the covering 21 of the roll bar 11, the side parts extending substantially in the vertical direction, can be at least partially shifted relative to the roll bar
11 during the shifting of the roof element 12 from the open position into the closed position and vice versa from the closed position into the open position, wherein the transverse part 24 of the covering 11, which transverse part extends substantially
in the horizontal direction, is fastened to the roll bar 11 and cannot be shifted relative thereto.

 The present invention relates to systems and methods for classifying a vehicle occupant.
 Modern vehicles include sensors for sensing a variety of conditions of a vehicle.  For example, wheel speed sensors, yaw rate sensors, steering angle sensors, and the like are used by electronic stability control (""ESC"") systems to improve
vehicle stability.  Vehicles also include sensors for improving the safety of a vehicle.  For example, front and rear impact sensors and force sensors are used to classify vehicle occupants and control the deployment of airbags and other occupant
restraints.
 Current occupant classification systems include, for example, four force sensors.  Each sensor provides an output which is summed to generate what is referred to as a reaction force on the seat.  The reaction force is used to determine the mass
of a control volume (i.e., the seat above the sensors and any objects located on the seat).  Using a known mass of the seat and the reaction force, the occupant weight is calculated.  The vehicle occupant is then classified based on the calculated
weight.
SUMMARY
 Although embodiments of the invention are described below with respect to a vehicle such as a passenger car, in other embodiments, the invention is installed in other vehicles, such as, aircraft, trains, trucks, buses, boats, all-terrain
vehicles, snowmobiles, and the like.  Additionally, although a vehicle occupant classification system is described below primarily with respect to the passenger seat of the vehicle, the vehicle occupant classification system may be included in other
seats and seat types within the vehicle (e.g., a driver's seat, one or more back seats, a bench seat, a bucket seat, etc.) to classify a vehicle occupant in each seat.
 In one embodiment, the invention provides a system for classifying an occupant using a reduced quantity of force sensors.  The system includes one or more force sensors (e.g., two force sensors), an electronic control unit (""ECU""), and a vehicle
safety system.  The force sensors are, for example, i-Bolt.TM.  sensors, or other suitable force sensors or force sensing systems.  The ECU includes, among other things, an occupant classification module and a safety monitoring module.  The occupant
classification module receives signals from the force sensors, determines one or more moments about a fixed point of a vehicle occupant control volume, and determines an occupant classification metric associated with a mass of the control volume and a
center of gravity of the control volume.  The occupant classification module uses the occupant classification metric to classify an occupant into one of a plurality of occupant classifications.  Based on the occupant classification, the safety monitoring
module controls one or more vehicle safety systems (e.g., an airbag deployment system, a seatbelt pre-tensioning system, or the like).  For example, when the occupant classification module classifies the vehicle occupant as a one-year-old child, the
airbag deployment system disables one or more airbags associated with the child's seat.
 In another embodiment, the invention provides a system for vehicle occupant classification and safety.  The system includes at least one force sensor and a controller.  The controller includes an occupant classification module configured to
receive an output signal from the at least one force sensor, determine a change in the output signal from the at least one force sensor, and generate an occupant classification metric.  The occupant classification metric is based on the change in the
output signal from the at least one force sensor and at least one auxiliary datum.  The occupant classification metric corresponds to a product of a mass and a location of a center of gravity of a control volume.  The occupant classification module is
also configured to classify a vehicle occupant based on the occupant classification metric.
 In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of classifying a vehicle occupant and controlling a system based on the classification.  The method includes receiving an output signal from at least one force sensor, determining a change
in the output signal from the at least one force sensor, and generating an occupant classification metric.  The occupant classification metric is based on the change in the output signal from the at least one force sensor and at least one auxiliary
datum.  The occupant classification metric corresponds to a product of a mass and a location of a center of gravity of a volume.  The method also includes classifying the vehicle occupant based on the occupant classification metric.
 In another embodiment, the invention provides a vehicle occupant classification system.  The system includes at least one force sensor, an auxiliary sensor, and a controller.  The controller includes an occupant classification module that is
configured to receive output signals from the at least one force sensor and the auxiliary sensor, and generate an occupant classification metric.  The occupant classification metric is based on the output signals from the at least one force sensor and
the auxiliary sensor.  The occupant classification module is also configured to classify a vehicle occupant based on the occupant classification metric.  The occupant classification metric is associated with a product of a mass and a height of a center
of gravity of a volume.

 Embodiments of the invention described herein relate to systems and methods for classifying one or more types of occupants within a vehicle, and controlling the operation of at least one vehicle safety system (e.g., an airbag deployment system,
a seatbelt pre-tensioning system, or the like) in response to the classification of the occupants.  The system includes one or more force sensors (e.g., two force sensors), an electronic control unit (""ECU""), and a vehicle safety system.  In one
embodiment of the invention, the force sensors are i-Bolt.TM.  sensors.  In other embodiments of the invention, other suitable force sensors or force sensing systems are used.  The ECU includes, among other things, an occupant classification module and a
safety monitoring module.  The occupant classification module receives signals from the force sensors, calculates one or more moments about a fixed point of a vehicle occupant control volume, and calculates an occupant classification metric associated
with a mass of the control volume and a center of gravity of the control volume.  The occupant classification module uses the occupant classification metric to classify an occupant into one of a plurality of occupant classifications.  Based on the
occupant classification, the safety monitoring module generates one or more control signals to compensate, enable, disable, or otherwise modify at least one vehicle safety system.  For example, when the occupant classification module classifies the
vehicle occupant as a one-year-old child, the airbag deployment system disables one or more airbags associated with child's seat.
 FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle 110 that includes a plurality of sensors.  The sensors are connected to, for example, an ECU 115 which uses the sensor signals to determine a plurality of conditions of the vehicle 110.  The sensors include wheel
speed sensors 120, brake sensors 125, a steering angle sensor (""SAS"") 130, a torque sensor 135, a front impact sensor 140, a rear impact sensor 145, side impact sensors 150, a lateral acceleration sensor 155, a yaw rate sensor 160, a wheel angle sensor
165, and force sensors 170.  The seat sensors include, for example, occupant force sensors such as i-Bolt.TM.  sensors (manufactured by Robert Bosch GmbH), strain gauges, or the like.  Data from each of the vehicle sensors is used by one or more vehicle
control systems or subsystems, such as an electronic stability control (""ESC"") system, a vehicle safety system, or a traction control system.
 FIG. 2 is a diagram of a vehicle control system 200 that includes the ECU 115, a vehicle safety module 205, and a vehicle data recorder 210.  The ECU 115 includes, among other things, a safety monitoring module 215, an occupant classification
module 220, a processing unit 230, a memory 235, and a bus 240.  The bus 240 connects various components of the ECU 115 including the memory 235 to the processing unit 230.  The memory 235 includes, for example, read only memory (""ROM""), random access
memory (""RAM""), and/or electrically erasable programmable read only memory (""EEPROM""), or other suitable memory types.  The ECU 115 also includes an input/output system that includes routines for transferring information between components within the ECU
115 and the various sensors and modules connected to the ECU 115.  Software included in the ECU 115 is stored in a memory such as the EEPROM or ROM, and includes, for example, firmware applications and other executable instructions.  The ECU 115 receives
signals from the vehicle sensors over, for example, a controller-area network (""CAN"") bus.  The ECU 115 conditions and processes the signals, and transmits the processed and conditioned signals to the vehicle safety module 205, the vehicle data recorder
210, or other vehicle control systems over the CAN bus.  The vehicle safety module 205 receives the processed and conditioned signals, and controls its operation accordingly.  In other embodiments, the ECU 115 includes additional, fewer, or different
components, or is connected to additional vehicle subsystems, such as a traction control system or an ESC system.
 The safety monitoring module 215 receives signals from the occupant classification module 220 and vehicle sensors such as the impact sensors 140, 145, and 150, the wheel speed sensors 120, the yaw rate sensor 160, and the lateral acceleration
sensor 155.  The safety monitoring module 215 uses these and other sensors to generate one or more control signals to control, among other things, the activation/deactivation of airbags and/or seatbelt pre-tensioning.  The safety monitoring module 215
sends control signals to the vehicle safety module 205 which interprets the control signals and applies them to, for example, an airbag control module 245 and/or a restraint control module 250 as necessary.
 Signals produced by the force sensors 170 are indicative of forces exerted on the seat.  The forces exerted on the seat include, for example, forces due to an occupant or other objects located on the seat, vehicle dynamics, intrinsic loads, and
other forces.  Vehicle dynamics depend on a travel surface, vehicle speed, vehicle acceleration, and the physical characteristics of the vehicle (such as tire inflation, tilt, and suspension).  Intrinsic loads are generally a result of tolerance
deviations in the sensors, and represent energy stored in the structure of the seat.  The other forces are due to gravity, such as the self-mass of the seat located above the sensors.  Additionally, the force exerted on the seat includes intrinsic forces
(those not due to the occupant), such as those caused by seatbelts under tension and objects wedged in the seat, and other objects or occupants leaning on the seat.
 The signals from the force sensors 170 are sent to the occupant classification module 220 in the ECU 115 which includes, for example, an offset module 260, a classification metric module 265, and an occupancy module 270.  The occupant
classification module 220 and the force sensors 170 are collectively referred to as an occupant classification system.  In one embodiment, the occupancy module 270, classification metric module 265, and the offset module 260 work together to classify a
vehicle occupant.  Using the signals received from the force sensors 170, the occupancy module 270 determines whether the seat is empty.  If the seat is empty, the occupancy module 270 communicates a signal to the offset module 260 instructing the offset
module 260 to determine an offset of the signals from the force sensors 170.  The offset corresponds to, for example, the intrinsic loads, the intrinsic forces, and the forces due to gravity which act on the seat when the seat is not occupied.  The
offset module 260 determines the offset using the signals from the force sensors 170, and communicates the offset to the classification metric module 265.  If the seat is not empty, the occupancy module 270 instructs the classification metric module 265
to determine an occupant classification metric based on one or more moments about a fixed point or a fixed axis of the seat, as described in greater detail below.  In some embodiments, the occupant classification metric is compensated using the offset
from the offset module 260.  In other embodiments, the occupancy module 270 determines that the occupancy of the seat is unknown and instructs the classification metric module 265 to determine the occupant classification metric without correcting for
offset errors.  The occupant classification module 220 then generates an occupant classification signal based on the occupant classification metric.  The occupant classification signal is sent to the safety monitoring module over the bus 240.
 The safety monitoring module 215 generates one or more control signals for controlling the vehicle safety module 205.  For example, if the occupant classification module 220 classifies an occupant as a child (e.g., a six-year-old child), the
safety monitoring module 215 produces a control signal that instructs the airbag control module 245 to deploy the airbag with a lower deployment force than would be used if the occupant were classified as an adult.  Alternatively, if the occupant
classification module 220 classifies an occupant as an infant, the safety monitoring module 215 produces a control signal that instructs the airbag control module 245 to disable the airbag to prevent it from being deployed.
 As shown in FIG. 2, the force sensors 170 are connected directly to the ECU 115 and the occupant classification module 220 is included in the ECU 115.  In another embodiment, the force sensors 170 are connected to a separate control unit that
includes the occupant classification module 220.  The separate control unit is then connected to the ECU 115.
 The force sensors 170 are generally located under one or more of the seats in the vehicle 110.  A type of sensor known as an intelligent bolt or i-Bolt.TM.  sensor (manufactured by Robert Bosch GmbH) is used in the embodiments of the invention
described herein.  However, other force or force sensor systems, such as a strain gauge system, an occupant classification (""OC"") sensor mat, a capacitive force measurement system, a passenger occupant detection (""POD"") system, or a belt tension sensor
(""BTS"") are used in other embodiments of the invention.
 FIG. 3 is a force diagram 300 for a vehicle seat 305.  The forces associated with the vehicle seat 305 are described with respect to an x-axis 310, a y-axis 315, and a z-axis 320.  The axes are used to identify, for example, accelerations acting
on the vehicle seat 305 in an x-direction 325, a y-direction 330, and a z-direction 335, respectively.  The illustrated vehicle seat 305 includes an infant car seat 340 carrying an infant.  The seat 305 and an occupant or object in the seat 305 cause
reaction forces R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.3, and R.sub.4 in the z-direction at junction points 345, 350, 355, and 360, respectively, where the seat 305 is connected to the vehicle.  An occupant classification system is coupled to the seat 305 for
classifying an occupant.  In other embodiments, the occupant classification system is installed in other vehicle seats or in another part of the vehicle.
 In contrast to vehicle occupant classification systems which use, for example, four force sensors to calculate an occupant weight, a reduction in the number of sensors needed to classify a vehicle occupant is achieved by using a relationship
between a mass of a control volume and a center of gravity (""COG"") 365 of the control volume.  The control volume is, in many instances, considered to be the entire vehicle seat above the force sensors 170 including the space occupied by any objects or
persons in the seats.  In some embodiments of the invention, the control volume is defined differently, such as only the space occupied by the objects or persons in the seats, or the area including the seat and up to the COG of the objects or persons in
the seats.  As such, in some embodiments, the control volume is dynamically changing based on conditions of the seat.
 As the diagram 400 in FIG. 4 illustrates, there is a relationship between the weight of a vehicle occupant and the height of the center of gravity of the control volume.  The diagram 400 illustrates an average weight of a vehicle occupant in
each of five occupant classes.  The occupant classes include a one-year old child class, a three-year-old child class, a six-year-old child class, an adult female in the lower-fifth weight percentile class, and an adult male in the fiftieth weight
percentile class.  FIG. 4 is illustrative and the occupant classification system includes additional or different occupant classifications in other embodiments.  As the weight of the occupant increases, the location of the center of gravity increases in
a similar manner.  Such a relationship allows for the classification of vehicle occupants based on a new occupant classification metric, a product of the mass of the control volume or the mass of an occupant (depending on sensor compensation) and a
height of the COG of the control volume.  The product of the mass of the control volume and a height of the COG of the control volume is determined indirectly using other sensor values, such as changes in the output values of force sensors and
accelerations, or other auxiliary data or signals.
 Auxiliary data or signals are data or signals received from or based on sensors such as the wheel speed sensors 120, the brake sensors 125, the SAS 130, the torque sensor 135, the front impact sensor 140, the rear impact sensor 145, the side
impact sensors 150, the lateral acceleration sensor 155, the yaw rate sensor 160, the wheel angle sensor 165, a lateral seat acceleration sensor, a longitudinal seat acceleration sensor, a vertical seat acceleration sensor, a lateral seat speed sensor, a
longitudinal seat speed sensor, a vertical seat speed sensor, a seat belt buckle sensor, a seatbelt tension sensor, a door sensor, or the like that are used in the calculation of the occupant classification metric.  Normally, four force sensors are used. Using the auxiliary data or signals permits the calculation of the occupant classification metric using, for example, two force sensors.
 Therefore, by using this occupant classification metric for classifying vehicle occupants, it is not necessary to directly calculate the height of the COG of the control volume or the mass of the occupant (although each can be calculated if
desired).  Instead, the product of the height of the COG and the mass of the control volume is derived based on a summation of moments about a stationary portion of the control volume.  For example, a support point, a support axis, or a support plane is
a portion of the control volume (e.g., a portion of the vehicle seat) that is fixed to the vehicle's floor.  A change in a velocity or an acceleration, such as a change in an acceleration in the x-direction, .DELTA.a.sub.x, and the moments which are
correspondingly generated about the support portion, are used to generate the occupant classification metric.  A summation of the moments about the support portion has a value equal to zero because the vehicle seat is stationary.  As a consequence of
summing the moments about the support portion of the seat, the number of force sensors required to classify an occupant is reduced.  For example, the number of force sensors is reduced from four sensors to three sensors, four sensors to two sensors, or
four sensors to one sensor, depending on the embodiment of the invention.
 As previously described, the offset module 260 is used to calculate an offset value for the seat when the seat is not occupied.  The offset value corresponds to vehicle dynamics, intrinsic loads, and intrinsic forces, as described above.  In
some embodiments, the offset value is used for compensating signals from the force sensors 170 or the occupant classification metric.  In other embodiments, the offsets in the outputs of the force sensors 170 are not compensated by the offset value. 
Instead, the values and ranges associated with each occupant classification are increased to account, at least in part, for the vehicle's dynamics, intrinsic loads, and intrinsic forces.  As such, the occupant classification metric is a product of the
height of the center of gravity, COG.sub.Z, of the control volume and the mass of the control volume (sometimes referred to as CGZM), not the mass of the occupant.
 A process 500 for implementing the occupant classification metric is illustrated in FIG. 5.  When a vehicle seat is installed or replaced, it is necessary to secure the seat to the vehicle.  The seat is secured using a plurality of bolts (e.g.,
four bolts).  According to one embodiment of the invention, two of the bolts are traditional fastening bolts, and two of the bolts are force sensing bolts.  The positions of the two fastening bolts are selected to define the support axis or the support
portion (step 505), which is then used as a reference for calculating moments of the seat.  A condition of the seat is then detected (step 510).  For example, one or more acceleration sensors located in the vehicle or, in some embodiments, in the vehicle
seat, are used to determine a change in acceleration of the vehicle.  Other auxiliary data can also be used individually or in combination with the acceleration sensors to determine the condition of the seat or occupant.
 Depending on the position of the selected support portion of the seat, a change in the acceleration along the x-axis or along the y-axis is used by the occupant classification system.  Based on the change in acceleration, a plurality of values
is identified related to the moments about the support portion (step 515).  For example, the forces acting on the seat in response to the change in acceleration and the respective distances of those forces from the support portion are determined.  Using
these values, the occupant classification metric is calculated (step 520).  The occupant classification metric is compared to predetermined values or ranges of values which correspond to different occupant classifications.  The occupant is classified
(step 525) according to the value or range of values which most closely correspond to the occupant classification metric.  The occupant classification system then generates a signal which is sent to the vehicle safety module 205.  The vehicle safety
module 205 is controlled (e.g., airbags enabled or disabled) based on the classification of the occupant (step 530).
 FIG. 6 provides an illustrative example of the invention.  A support portion 600 is selected as an axis in the Y-direction (see FIG. 3) which includes the first seat junction 345 and the second seat junction 350.  The sum of the moments, M,
which are generated about the support portion 600 with respect to a change in, for example, the acceleration in the x-direction, .DELTA.a.sub.x, is equal to zero, as shown by EQN.  1.  .SIGMA.M.sub.@R.sub.1,2=0 EQN.  1
 The change in the acceleration in the x-direction, .DELTA.a.sub.x, results in two moments about the support portion 600.  The first moment is a result of the distance or width, W, between the support portion and third and fourth seat junctions
355 and 360, and the change in the reaction forces of the force sensors 170 at the third and fourth junctions, .DELTA.R.sub.3+4.  The second moment results from the product of the mass, m, of the control volume and the change in the acceleration in the
x-direction, .DELTA.a.sub.x, and the height of the center of gravity of the control volume, COG.sub.Z, above the support portion.  The height of the center of gravity, COG.sub.Z, is measured from the z-plane formed by the x-axis 310 and the y-axis 315. 
As noted above, the summation of the first and second moments has a value equal to zero, as shown below in EQN.  2.  .DELTA.R.sub.3+4*W+m.DELTA.a.sub.x*COG.sub.Z=0 EQN.  2 Using EQN.  2, the product of the height of the center of gravity, COG.sub.Z, and
the mass of the control volume is determined as shown below in EQN.  3.
 .DELTA..times..times..DELTA..times..times..times.  ##EQU00001## The product of the height of the center of gravity, COG.sub.Z, and the mass, m, of the control volume is the occupant classification metric (i.e., CGZM).  In embodiments of the
invention that include, for example, a single force sensor, the change in the reaction forces or output of the single force sensor is used in combination with auxiliary data to generate the occupant classification metric.  To generate the occupant
classification metric using a single force sensor, additional or different auxiliary data than that described above with respect to FIG. 6 is used (e.g., a belt tension sensor, etc.).  In some embodiments, a second force sensor is assumed to have the
same output or changes in output as the single force sensor.  As such, the occupant classification metric can be calculated using EQN.  3 above with a single sensor.  Such embodiments may be less accurate than two sensor embodiments, but the same or
similar occupant classifications are achieved.
 The occupant classification system includes a plurality of pre-programmed or pre-loaded occupant classifications corresponding to different values of the occupant classification metric.  The occupant classification information associated with
the occupant classification metric, and used in various embodiments of the invention, is collected, for example, through the testing of moments about various support portions under different vehicle and/or seat conditions.  In one embodiment, the test
information is collected in a controlled manner using a vehicle car seat and test subjects of varying classifications.  Using the reduced force sensor system and method described above, information regarding the test subjects is gathered for a plurality
of test conditions, including accelerations in multiple directions (e.g., the x-direction and the y-direction) and velocities in multiple directions (e.g., a summation or integral of velocities can be used in place of a measured acceleration).  The test
subjects vary in weight and the vehicle seat is configured in a variety of positions.  In other embodiments, alternative test information concerning occupant classification is collected and stored (e.g., different sensor configurations, different seat
configurations, and different test subjects).  Although the invention is described above with respect to an embodiment that includes two force sensors, some embodiments of the invention use a single force sensor, and a summation of the moments about a
support point is used to generate the occupant classification metric and classify an occupant.
 The occupant classification metric is used to generate an occupant classification signal corresponding to an occupant classification.  The occupant classification signal is sent to the safety monitoring module 215 and the vehicle safety module
205 to control the operation of, for example, an airbag deployment system (e.g., to control the airbag deployment timing or airbag deployment force) or a restraint control module which controls, for example, seat belt pre-tensioning.
 Classifying occupants in the manner described above allows the ECU 115 to perform a variety of additional functions which are unable to be performed using conventional vehicle occupant classification techniques.  For example, FIG. 7A illustrates
a first diagram 700 of responses for two sensors coupled to a vehicle seat.  One of the sensors is located in a front portion of the vehicle seat, and the second sensor is located in a rear portion of the vehicle seat.  As the acceleration of the vehicle
increases in a forward direction, the occupant's weight shifts from the front of the seat to the rear of the seat.  In an occupant classification system that uses a sum of, for example, four force sensors to classify an occupant, the sum of the sensors
does not change.  Instead, for two properly functioning force sensors, the output of the front sensor will decrease as the output of the rear sensor increases, as shown in the diagram 700.
 Alternatively, if one of the front or rear sensors is faulty, the conventional occupant classification system may mis-classify the occupant.  As shown in diagram 705 of FIG. 7B, the output of the front sensor decreases significantly slower than
the output of the rear sensor increases.  Such a discrepancy between the changes in the forces alters the sum of the force sensors and causes the conventional occupant classification system to incorrectly classify the vehicle occupant.  Such an error is
avoided using the occupant classification metric described above.  For example, the occupant classification system is able to determine if one of the force sensors is faulty by calculating a first occupant classification metric with the support portion
at the front sensor.  The occupant classification system then calculates a second occupant classification metric with the support portion at the rear sensor.  Because the moments of the seat are based on changes in, for example, acceleration, and not the
magnitude of the output of the force sensors, when the first and second occupant classification metrics are compared, the classifications are the same (e.g., the metrics may have opposite signs but result in the occupant being classified into the same
occupant classification).  If the metrics are not the same, the occupant classification system uses, for example, previously calculated occupant classification metrics to determine which of the force sensors is faulty.
 Additionally or alternatively, the occupant classification metric described above avoids potential errors associated with load-shunted force sensors.  For example, if an object is wedged between the vehicle seat and the floor or against the
force sensor, the output of the force sensor is prevented from increasing as shown in diagram 710 of FIG. 8.  As the acceleration in an x- or y-direction increases, the output of the force sensors increases when there are no wedged objects present.  If,
however, a wedged object is present, the output of the force sensor is prevented from increasing as the acceleration continues to increase.  Because the force sensor output does not change, the occupant may be misclassified by the conventional occupant
classification system.  The occupant classification metric, which relies, in part, on the change in the acceleration of the vehicle, is able to detect the load-shunted condition because a shunted response of the force sensor does not change
correspondingly with the change in acceleration.
 An additional application of the occupant classification metric enhances the safety of the vehicle safety module 205.  Although the occupant classification technique described above is capable of reducing the number of sensors needed, using such
a technique in a vehicle occupant classification system having four force sensors per seat, enables the occupant classification system to determine the actual acceleration of an object in the seat.  In such an instance, the occupant classification metric
is not based on the acceleration of the vehicle, but rather on the acceleration of the object in the seat.  Accordingly, the timing of, for example, airbag deployment or the seatbelt pre-tensioning force is modified to provide optimum protection to a
vehicle occupant based on the occupant's actual acceleration in the seat.  Determining the occupant's actual acceleration is accomplished by generating a series of equations using multiple support portions as references.  The series of equations include,
for example, two or more unknown values, such as the occupant classification metric and the occupant's acceleration.  The series of equations are solved for the two unknown values, and the occupant classification metric and the occupant acceleration are
output from the occupant classification system.  In some embodiments, such a calculation is performed for the acceleration of the occupant in both the x-direction and the y-direction, and a resultant acceleration vector for the occupant is calculated.
 In some embodiments of the invention, the signals and information from the vehicle sensors, the vehicle safety module 205, and the occupant classification system are sent to the vehicle data recorder 210 over the CAN bus.  For example, collision
information, sensor offset information, airbag force and timing information, and occupant classification information is stored in an internal memory of the vehicle data recorder 210 for later analysis by, for example, an insurance company to assist in
determining which driver may be at fault in a collision, and/or if a seat or force sensor is defective.
 The force sensors described above with respect to occupant classification are configured such that when their measurement axis is aligned with gravity (e.g., is perpendicular to the ground), the force sensors generate an output which includes
two components.  The total output of the force sensor is given as mg+F(a) EQN.  4 where m*g is a weight and F(a) is an inertial force due to the acceleration of the platform to which the seat is attached.  The occupant classification system described
above is described with respect to the F(a) component.  For example, the occupant classification system requires, in some embodiments, a subtraction of the weight component m*g to obtain the F(a) component.  As such, a seat with integrated force sensors
forms a large accelerometer in which inertial properties are defined by the seat and occupant centers of mass.  Using the information from the force sensors, the following can be determined: 1) if the mass configuration is known, then the measured
dynamic forces can be used to infer accelerations (i.e., vehicle state estimation); 2) if the accelerations are known, then the measured dynamic forces can be used to infer mass configuration (i.e., occupant classification); and 3) if both the mass
configuration and the accelerations are known, the measured dynamic forces can be used to infer internal dynamics of the seat and/or the occupant which can then be used for system diagnostics and classification.
 The capabilities and limitations of such a system are based on the number, location, and properties of the force sensors, as well as the design of the seat.
 Thus, the invention provides, among other things, a system for classifying a vehicle occupant and controlling the operation of at least one vehicle safety system in response to the occupant classification.  Various features and advantages of the
invention are set forth in the following claims.

",,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The present invention relates to the pick-up type utility vehicle.
 2.  Description of the Related Art
 Generally, a pick-up type utility vehicle has a comparatively large cargo bed in the division behind the seat in comparison with the bar steering wheel type utility vehicle belonging to all terrain vehicles.  Therefore, the pick-up type utility
vehicle is used for practical use such as movement in golf courses, golf course maintenance, hunting in fields, conveyance of lumber, and the like.
 The present applicants have formerly developed inventions relating to the pick-up style utility vehicle with an expandable cargo bed.  These applications have been filed and registered.  For example, these are U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  6,905,159;
6,994,388; and 7,249,798.
 FIG. 13 shows the pick-up type utility vehicle 901 described in each of the above documents.  The pick-up type utility vehicle 901 has a front seat 902, a rear seat 903, and a cargo bed CN.  The cargo bed CN is configured by a bottom plate 907
and a plate part 904 which is arranged on the bottom plate 907.  The pick-up type utility vehicle 901 can change a normal state where 4 passengers can ride the pick-up type utility vehicle 901, and an expanded state where 2 passengers can ride the
pick-up type utility vehicle 901 and the cargo bed is expanded.  In addition, a screen 905 is arranged on the bottom plate 907 between the plate part 904 and the rear seat 903.
 FIG. 14 is a side view which shows the pick-up type utility vehicle 901 in the normal state.  In the normal state, a passenger can ride on both the front seat 902 and the rear seat 903.  The rear seat 903 is rotatably supported around a
horizontal shaft 935 which is arranged at the front end portion of the rear seat 903.  In FIG. 14, the rear seat 903 in the use position P1 and the cargo bed CN in the normal state are shown.  The rear seat 903 in the use position P1 indicates the rear
seat 903 which is on the bottom plate 907.
 FIG. 15 is a side view which shows the pick-up type utility vehicle 901 in the expanded state.  In the expanded state, the rear seat 903 is in the shunting position P2.  The rear seat 903 in the shunting position P2 is standing and is forward
relative to the bottom plate 907.  Therefore, a passenger can not ride on the rear seat 903 in the shunting position P2.  On the other hand, as the rear seat 903 shunts forward relative to the bottom plate 907, the whole surface of the bottom plate 907
is opened.  Therefore, the cargo bed CE in the expanded state is expanded relative to the cargo bed CN in the normal state.
 Change from the normal state to the expanded state is performed as follows.  Firstly, the rear seat 903 which is rotatable around the horizontal shaft 935 is toppled forward from the use position P1 to the shunting position P2.  Secondly, the
position of the screen 905 is changed forward depending on the change of the position of the rear seat 903.  As a result, the front portion of the bottom plate 907 is opened, too.  Therefore, the whole surface of the bottom plate 907 can be used as the
bottom surface of the cargo bed.  In addition, the expansion side plate is stored in the plate part 904, and the expansion side plate 943 is expanded forward.  In this way, the cargo bed CE in the expanded state is constituted.
 FIG. 16 shows one example of the screen shield 905.  For example, the screen shield 905 consists of steel frames and wire nettings.  Therefore, the screen shield 905 is a heavy load.  In addition, the screen shield 905 is supported in the
chassis by inserting projection portions 905a, 905a of the screen shield 905 in attachment bores arranged in both end portions of the chassis in the right and left direction.  In other words, it is necessary to lift the screen shield 905 in order to move
the screen shield 905.  Therefore, two persons were necessary to change a position of the screen shield 905, and it was difficult to work only with one person.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The present inventions have been made in view of the above problems.  An object of the present inventions is to make lifting the screen unnecessary for movement of the screen with the change of the cargo bed.
 The first invention provides a pick-up type utility vehicle with an expandable cargo bed, comprising: a front seat; a rear seat; the cargo bed; and a screen separating between the rear seat and the cargo bed, on the chassis.  The pick-up type

a shaft oriented in the right and left direction.  The rear main seat 31 is rotatably supported by the rear support stand 16 around a horizontal shaft 35.
 As the rear main seat 31 is rotatable around the horizontal shaft 35, the rear seat 3 is movable between the use position P1 and the shunting position P2.  The use position P1 is shown in FIG. 1-FIG. 3.  In the use position P1, the passengers
can ride on the rear seat 3.  The shunting position P2 is shown in FIG. 4.  Although mentioned later in detail, the screen 5 can move forward by moving the rear seat 3 to the shunting position P2.
 FIG. 2 is a plan view which shows the cargo bed 4 in the normal state.  The cargo bed 4 is configured by the bottom plate 7, the screen 5, two side cases 41L and 41R, and a rear plate 42.  The bottom plate 7 is fixed to the rear support stand
16.  The two side cases 41L and 41R are fixed to the end of the bottom plate 7 in the right and left direction.  The rear plate 42 is arranged at the rear end of the bottom plate 7.  The screen 5 is arranged on the bottom plate 7 so that the screen 5
faces the rear plate 42.  Here, the bottom plate 7 configures the bottom surface of the cargo bed 4.  The two side cases 41L and 41R configure the side surfaces.  The rear plate 42 configures the rear surface of the cargo bed 4.  The screen 5 configures
the front surface of the cargo bed 4.
 FIG. 3 is a side view which shows the cargo bed 4 in the normal state.  In FIG. 3 (the normal state), the rear seat 3 is in the use position P1, the screen 5 is a rear side position Q1.
 The pick-up type utility vehicle 1 has a steering wheel 90 (the operating part) and a movement mechanism 100 as a means for moving the screen 5.  The movement mechanism 100 moves the screen 5 in the front and back direction by the rotative force
generated by rotation of the steering wheel 90.  The movement mechanism 100 is stored in a side case 41L of the left side.  The side case 41L is a hollow case.
 In FIG. 3, the movement mechanism 100 has a first sprocket 101, a second sprocket 102, and a chain belt 110.  The first sprocket 101 and the second sprocket 102 are rotatably supported by the side case 41L.  The first sprocket 101 is arranged at
the front portion in the side case 41L, and the second sprocket 102 is arranged at the rear portion in the side case 41L.  The chain belt 110 is wound around the first sprocket 101 and the second sprocket 102.  An engagement hole 101a is formed in the
shaft center portion of the first sprocket 101.  The distal portion 90a of the steering wheel 90 engages the engagement hole 101a.  In addition, the movement mechanism 100 has a slider 120 and a connecting tool 130.  The slider 120 is fixed to the left
end portion of the screen 5.  The slider 120 is arranged so that the slider 120 contacts the upper surface 41a of the side case 41L.  The connecting tool 130 connects the left end portion of the screen 5 and the chain belt 110.
 The passengers can move the screen 5 by rotating the steering wheel 90.  First, the first sprocket 101 rotates by rotation of the steering wheel 90.  By rotation of the first sprocket 101, the chain belt 110 drives and the connecting tool 130
moves in the front and back direction.  Therefore, the screen 5 moves in the front and back direction.  In FIG. 3, when the steering wheel 90 rotates in the clockwise direction, the first sprocket 101 rotates in the clockwise direction.  At this time,
the upper portion of the chain belt 110 moves backward, and the lower portion of the chain belt 110 moves forward.  Here, the connecting tool 130 is fixed to the lower portion of the chain belt 110.  Therefore, the screen 5 moves forward by rotation of
the steering wheel 90 in the clockwise direction.  On the contrary, the screen 5 moves backward by rotation of the steering wheel 90 in the counterclockwise direction.
 A guide mechanism of the screen 5 is configured by the slider 120, the connecting tool 130, and the side case 41L.  Here, an elongate hole 41b for passing the connecting part 130 is formed in the right wall of the side case 41L.  In addition,
the connecting tool 130 is arranged so that the connecting tool 130 contacts the upper surface of the elongate hole 41b.  Therefore, the posture of the screen 5 under movement is maintained in the slider 120, the connecting tool 130, and the side case
41L.
 The screen 5 is movable in a moving range R. The moving range R is a range from the front side position Q2 to the rear side position Q1 in the front and back direction.  The capacity of the cargo bed 4 is changed according to the position of the
screen 5.  As shown in FIG. 3, when the screen 5 is in the rear side position Q1, the cargo bed 4 in the normal state.  As shown in FIG. 4, when the screen 5 is in the front side position.  Q2, the cargo bed 4 in the expanded state.
 In FIG. 3, the steering wheel 90 is removable with respect to the movement mechanism 100'.  By pulling the steering wheel 90 to the left side along the axial direction of the first sprocket 101, the engaging of the engagement hole 101a and the
distal portion 90a is canceled.  On the contrary, when the steering wheel 90 is stuffed into the first sprocket 101, the distal portion 90a engages with the engagement hole 101a.  In FIG. 1, the through hole 41c for passing the distal portion 90a of the
steering wheel 90 is formed in the left wall of the side case 41L.
 In FIG. 3, the movement mechanism 100 further has a lock mechanism of the screen 5.  The lock mechanism is configured by two or more pin holes 151 formed in the side case 41L, and a pin which can be inserted in the pin hole 151.  The pin holes
151 are respectively set in the positions where the screen 5 in the rear side position Q1 and the front side position Q2 can be locked.
 FIG. 4 is a side view which shows the cargo bed 4 in the expanded state.  In FIG. 4 (the expanded state), the rear seat 3 is in the shunting position P2, and the screen 5 is in the front side position Q2.
 First, the passengers move the rear seat 3 from the use position P1 to the shunting position P2 in the change from the normal state to the expanded state.  The rear seat 3 in the shunting position P2 is standing and is at the front side of the
bottom plate 7.  By shunting the rear seat 3, an empty space occurs in the front portion of the bottom plate 7.  The screen 5 can be advanced to the empty space.  Second, the passengers move the screen 5 from the rear side position Q1 to the front side
position Q2 by operating the steering wheel 90.  As a result, the capacity of the cargo bed 4 is extended.
 In the first embodiment, the screen 5 can be moved by operation of the steering wheel 90.  The capacity of the cargo bed 4 changes with movements of the screen 5.  Therefore, in the pick-up type utility vehicle 1, it is not necessary to lift the
screen 5 to reposition the screen 5 in accordance with changes of states in the cargo bed 4.
Second Embodiment
 FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 show the pick-up type utility vehicle 1 in the second embodiment.  The second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment except for differences in the movement mechanism.  The second embodiment has a movement mechanism 200
instead of the movement mechanism 100 in the first embodiment.  The same numerals are used for the portions which are common in the first embodiment and the second embodiment.
 FIG. 5 is a front view which snows the screen 5 and the movement mechanism 200.  The movement mechanism 200 also moves the screen 5 in the front and back direction by the rotative force generated by rotation of the steering wheel 90.  The
movement mechanism 200 has a deceleration mechanism 210, main movement mechanisms 220L and 220R, first guide mechanisms 230L and 230R, second guide mechanisms 240L and 240R, a transmission shaft 250.  The main movement mechanism 220L, the first guide
mechanism 230L, and the second guide mechanism 240L are stored in the side case 41L of the left side.  The main movement mechanism 220R, the first guide mechanism 230R, and the second guide mechanism 240R are stored in the side case 41R of the right
side.
 The operation is as follows.  The rotative force by the steering wheel 90 is inputted into the deceleration mechanism 210.  The rotative force is transmitted to both sides of the main movement mechanisms 220L and 220R via the transmission shaft
250.  As a result, the screen 5 moves in the front and back direction.  Here, the posture of the screen 5 under movement is maintained by the first guide mechanisms 230L and 230R, and the second guide mechanisms 240L and 240R.
 FIG. 6 is a side view which shows the screen 5 and the movement mechanism 200.  Referring to FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, the configuration of the movement mechanism 200 is explained in detail.
 In FIG. 6, the deceleration mechanism 210 has a first deceleration sprocket 211, a second deceleration sprocket 212, a third deceleration sprocket 213, and a fourth deceleration sprocket 214.  The first deceleration sprocket 211 can removably
engage with the distal portion 90a of the steering wheel 90.  The second deceleration sprocket 212 engages with the first deceleration sprocket 211, and the third deceleration sprocket 213 engages with the second deceleration sprocket 212.  The third
deceleration sprocket 213 and the fourth deceleration sprocket 214 are connected via a connecting shaft 215, and rotate integrally.  Here, as the diameter of the first deceleration sprocket 211 is smaller than the diameter of the third deceleration
sprocket 213, the rotative force is reduced.
 In FIG. 6, the main movement mechanism 220L has a first sprocket 221, a second sprocket 222, a third sprocket 223, a chain belt 224, and a connecting tool 225.  The sprockets 221, 222, and 223 are rolled with the chain belt 224.  The fourth
deceleration sprocket 214 of the deceleration mechanism 210 also engages the chain belt 224.
 In FIG. 5, the connecting tool 225 connects the chain belt 224 and the screen 5.  The connecting tool 225 is configured by, a chain bracket 226, a screen bracket 227, and a connecting shaft 228.  The chain bracket 226 is fixed to the upper
portion of the chain belt 224.  The screen bracket 227 is fixes to the right end portion of the screen 5.  The connecting shaft 228 connects the chain bracket 226 and the screen bracket 227.  Therefore, the screen 5 interlocks with movement of the chain
belt 224.  The main movement mechanism 220R has the same configuration as the main movement mechanism 220L.
 In FIG. 5, the transmission shaft 250 connects the first sprocket 221 of the main movement mechanism 220L and the first sprocket 221 of the main movement mechanism 220R.
 In FIG. 6, the first guide mechanism 230L of the left side has guide rails 231 and 232, and a guide roller 233.  The guide rails 231 and 232 are rails which extend toward the front and back direction.  The guide rails 231 and 232 are fixed to
the side case 41L.  The guide roller 233 is arranged between the guide rail 231 and the guide rail 232.  Therefore, the guide roller 233 is movable only in the front and back direction.
 In FIG. 5, the guide roller 233 is rotatably supported by the above connecting shaft 228.  Therefore, the guide roller 233 is supported by the screen 5 via the connecting shaft 228 and the screen bracket 227.  The first guide mechanism 230R of
the right side has also the same configuration as the first guide mechanism 230L of the left side.

plates 161 and 161 are hidden, and the cargo bed 4 in the normal state is configured.  When the screen 5 is in the front side position Q2, the expansion side plates 161 and 161 are exposed, the cargo bed 4 in the expanded state is configured (FIG. 9).
 FIG. 8 is a side view which shows the cargo bed 4 in the normal state.  The movement mechanism 300 is configured by a feed screw.  The movement mechanism 300 has a feed screw shaft 310, a nut 320, two bearings 330 and 330, and a telescopic axis
340.  The bearings 330 and 330 are fixed to the bottom surface of the bottom plate 7.  The feed screw shaft 310 is rotatably supported by the bearings 330 and 330.  The nut 320 is geared to the feed screw shaft 310.  Here, a long hole 70 is formed in the
front portion of the bottom plate 7 of the third embodiment.  The lower end of the screen 5 projects on the lower side of the bottom plate 7 via the long hole 70.  The nut 320 is fixed to the bottom surface of the screen 5.  In addition, the long hole 70
is formed along the front and back direction to correspond with the moving range R of the screen 5.  The telescopic axis 340 connects the rear end of the feed screw shaft 310 and the steering wheel 90.
 FIG. 9 is a side view which shows the cargo bed 4 in the expanded state.
 By rotation of the steering wheel 90, the feed screw shaft 310 rotates, and the nut 320 moves along the axial direction of the feed screw shaft 310.  As a result, the screen 5 moves in the front and back direction.
 The passengers can adjust the position, of the steering wheel 90 in the front and back direction by elongating and contracting the telescopic axis 340.  In addition, a screw formed in the feed screw shaft 310 is preferably an acme screw.
 Next, the interlocking device 500 is explained.  The interlocking device 500 is a device which moves a rear seat 103 in conjunction with the screen 5.  The interlocking device 500 is configured by a linkage mechanism.
 In FIG. 8, the rear seat 103 has the rear main seat 31, the rear backrest 32, two support brackets 37 and 37, and a horizontal shaft 38.  The two support brackets 37 and 37 are fixed to the lower end of the screen 5.  The rear main seat 31 is
rotatably supported by the two support brackets 37 and 37 via the horizontal shaft 38.  The horizontal shaft 38 is a shaft of the right and left direction.  The rear backrest 32 is fixed to the front face of the screen 5.

both ends of the link arm 510.
 In FIG. 8, the screen 5 is in the rear side position Q1, and the rear main seat 31 is in the use position P1.  If the screen 5 moves forward by rotation of the steering wheel 90, the horizontal shaft 38 moves forward.  Here, as the second shaft
502 is supported by the side plate 141, the second shaft 502 is not interlocked with the screen 5.  In addition, the length of the link arm 510 does not change.  Therefore, if the screen 5 moves forward, the link arm 510 rotates around the second shaft
502 and the first shaft 501 moves backward.  As a result, the rear main seat 31 rotates backward around the horizontal shaft 38 and the rear main seat 31 stands up.  As shown in FIG. 9, when the screen 5 reaches the front side position Q1, the rear main
seat 31 is in the shunting position P2.
 In the third embodiment, rotation of the steering wheel 90 not only moves the screen 5 in the front and back direction, but also moves the rear main seat 31 so as not to interfere with the screen 5.

 The present invention relates to the field of vehicle storage consoles, and more particularly, to a vehicle console having a storage retention structure.
BACKGROUND
 It is well known to provide consoles in motor vehicles that have storage compartments integrated therein.  Such storage consoles are often located in between a front driver's seat and a front passenger's seat of the vehicle, but such consoles
may be positioned in various other locations throughout the vehicle.  Central to vehicle console design is the requirement that meaningful storage options be provided to the users of the vehicle.  In pursuit of this goal, vehicle designers have proposed
a vast array of designs for console storage compartments, including console storage compartments that may be reconfigured by the user to suit their specific needs.
 Providing a console having a storage compartment that is reconfigurable presents some unique challenges.  The reconfigurable elements must be easily repositionable by the user, but, at the same time, must be secured firmly in place.  Firm
securement of the moveable components ensures that they do not become inadvertently dislodged.  Additionally, the presence of squeak and rattle noise within the vehicle should be minimized.  Balancing these competing design goals while at the same time
providing meaningful storage options for the user has proven difficult, and past designs have met varying degrees of success.  Need remains for improvement in the field of console storage retention structures.

substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction.
 A first channel 40 is disposed adjacent to the first wall 32 and includes an opening 40 that is oriented in an upward direction.  A second channel 44 is disposed adjacent to the second wall 34 and includes an opening 46 that is oriented in an
upward direction.  The first channel 40 and the second channel 44 may be elongate structures that extend along the first wall 32 and the second wall 34, respectively (e.g., along at least a majority of the first wall 32 and the second wall 34,
respectively, as shown in FIG. 3).  In particular, the first channel 40 is defined in part by an elongate wall 48 that is positioned opposite the first wall 32 of the compartment 20.  Similarly, the second channel 44 is defined in part by an elongate
wall 50 that is opposite the second wall 34 of the compartment 20.  Furthermore, the first channel 40 and the second channel 44 may each define a substantially U-shaped cross-section having either rectilinear, curvilinear, or substantially arcuate sides
including the elongate walls 48, 50, respectively.  Additionally, the first channel 40 and the second channel 44 may be formed unitarily with the first wall 32 and the second wall 34, respectively.  For example, the first channel 40, the second channel
44, the first wall 32, and/or the second wall 34 may be formed as a single component during a molding process.
 The first channel 40 and the second channel 44 are configured and spaced with respect to one another such that they may cooperate to support hanging file folders of a conventional type.  While the entire width of the first channel 40 and the
second channel 44 could be used for this purpose, alternatively, a portion of the width of the first channel 40 and the second channel 44 could be utilized to support the hanging file folders while the remainder of the width of the first channel 40 and
the second channel 44 could be utilized to support a removable tray member 52 having a width that is less than the width of the first channel 40 and the second channel 44.
 The tray member 52 is supported within the compartment 20 of the console 10 by the first channel 40 and the second channel 44.  As will be explained in detail herein, a plurality of retainer structures 54 are provided within the first channel 40
and the second channel 44 to secure the tray member 52 with respect to the body portion 18 of the console 20.  In particular, the plurality of retainer structures 54 includes a first pair of retainer structures 54a and a second pair of retainer
structures 54b, both of which are disposed within the first channel 40.  Similarly, the plurality of retainer structures 54 includes a third pair of retainer structures 54c and a fourth pair of retainer structures 54d, both of which are disposed within
the second channel 44.
 The individual retainer structures 54 that make up each pair of retainer structures 54a through 54d are laterally-spaced apart from one another.  In particular, the individual retainer structures 54 that make up each pair of retainer structures
54a through 54d are spaced apart by a width that is slightly less than the width of the tray member 52.  Furthermore, the first pair of retainer structures 54a and the second pair of retainer structures 54b are positioned in an overlapping configuration,
such that a single retainer structure of the first pair of retainer structures 54a is positioned between the second pair of retainer structures 54b and a single one of the second pair of retainer structures 54b is positioned between the first pair of
retainer structures 54a.  The third pair of retainer structures 54c and the fourth pair of retainer structures 54d are positioned in a similar, staggered manner within the fourth channel 44, such that the first pair of retainer structures 54a and the
third pair of retainer structures 54c are aligned with respect to each other in the first or longitudinal direction, while the second pair of retainer structures 54b and the fourth pair of retainer structures 54d are aligned with respect to each other in
the first or longitudinal direction.
 As shown in FIG. 4, the tray member 52 is a unitary body that extends from a first end 56 to a second end 58 in the first or longitudinal direction and extends between a first side 60 and a second side 62 in the second or lateral direction.  The
tray member 52 defines one or more upwardly-facing storage areas 53 for holding various articles, as desired by a user.
 In order to support the tray member 52 with respect to the first channel 40 and the second channel 44 of the console 10, a first pair of engagement structures 64 is positioned at the first end 56 of the tray member 52, and a second pair of
engagement structures 66 is positioned at the second end 58 of the tray member 52.  The first pair of engagement structures 64 is spaced apart in the second or lateral direction such that each is adjacent to a respective one of the first side 60 and the
second side 62 of the tray member 52.  The second pair of engagement structures 66 are likewise spaced-apart in the lateral direction such that each is adjacent to a respective one of the first side 60 and the second side 62 of the tray member 52.  As
will be explained in detail herein, the first pair of engagement structures 64 is configured to be received within the first channel 40, while the second pair of engagement structures 66 is configured to be received within the second channel 44. 
Furthermore, the first pair of engagement structures 64 are selectively engageable with either the first pair of retainer structures 54a or the second pair of retainer structures 54b.  Similarly, the second pair of engagement structures are selectively
engageable with the third pair of retainer structures 54c or the fourth pair of retainer structures 54d.
 FIG. 5 shows one of the engagement structures of the first pair of engagement structures 64 as representative of both the first pair of engagement structures and the second pair of engagement structures 66.  The engagement structure 64 is
located at the first end 56 of the tray member 52 adjacent to the first side 60 of the tray member 52.  More particularly, the engagement structure 64 includes an outer portion 68 that is disposed directly adjacent to the first side 60 of the tray
member, and an inner portion 70 that is disposed inward of the outer portion 68 and spaced therefrom by a slot 72.  Provision of the slot 72 between the outer portion 68 and the inner portion 70 of the engagement structure 64 allows the inner portion 70
of the engagement structure 64 to deflect outward toward the outer portion 68, as will be explained further herein.  On both of the outer portion 68 and the inner portion 70, bottom surfaces 74 are provided for engagement with the bottom of the first
channel 40 when the engagement structure 64 is disposed within the first channel 40.
 As shown in FIG. 6, slots 76 are defined through the first side 60 and second side 62 of the tray member 52.  The slots 76 are downwardly facing and are disposed between both the first pair of engagement structures 64, as well as the second pair
of engagement structures 66 (not shown in FIG. 6), and a wall 78 that at least partially defines the storage areas 53 of the tray member 52.  The slots 76 extend across the tray member 52 in the second, lateral direction.  The elongate walls 48, 50 of
the first channel 40 and the second channel 44, respectively, are receivable within the slots 76 to further support and retain the tray member 52 with respect to the compartment 20 of the console 10.  As shown in FIG. 7, the slots 76 that are defined
through the first side 60 and the second side 62 of the tray member 52 may be aligned with or integrally-formed with a downwardly-facing groove 79 that is provided on an underside 80 of the tray member 52 at each of the first end 56 and the second end 58
thereof.  As with the slots 76, the elongate walls 48, 50 of the first channel 40 and the second channel 44, respectively, are receivable within the downwardly facing groove 79.  It should be apparent that engagement of any of the engagement structures
64, 66, the slots 76 and/or the grooves 79 with respective portions of the first channel 40 and the second channel 44 is operable to restrain movement of the tray member 52 with respect to the console 10 in the first or longitudinal direction.
 Engagement of the tray member 52 with the first channel 40 and the second channel 44 will be further understood with reference to FIG. 8, which shows the second pair of engagement structures 66 of the tray member 52 disposed within the second
channel 44 and in engagement with the third pair of retainer structures 54c.  The retainer structures 54c, 54d extend upward from a bottom wall 41 of the second channel 44 for engagement with the second pair of engagement structures 66 of the tray member
52.  Through engagement of the engagement structures 64, 66 with the retainer structures 54a-54d, movement of the tray member 52 with respect to the console 10 is restrained in the second or lateral direction.
 In the illustrated embodiment, the third and fourth pairs of retainer structures 54c, 54d are substantially J-shaped members having hooked portions 55 opposite the bottom wall 41 of the second channel 44.  Since the third and fourth pairs of
retainer structures 54c, 54d are formed integrally with the second channel 44 from a plastic material, the third and fourth pairs of retainer structures 54c, 54d exhibit some resiliency at their hook-shaped portions 55.  This, coupled with the fact that
the inner portions 70 of the second pair of engagement structures 66 also exhibit some resiliency, serves to define a snap-fit engagement between the second pair of retainer structures 66 and any of the third pair of retainer structures 54c and the
fourth pair of retainer structures 54d (shown in phantom in FIG. 8).  Alternatively, it will be readily understood that a friction fit could be defined between the engagement structures 64, 66 and the retainer structures 54a-54d, for example, by
providing either of the engagement structures 64, 66 or the retainer structures 54a-54d in the form of openings, while providing the other of the engagement structures 64, 66 and the retainer structures 54a-54d in the form of projections that are
dimensioned to be received within the openings by a friction fit.
 As can be appreciated from the foregoing, the tray member 52 is positionable within the compartment 20 of the console 10 in a first position, as shown in FIG. 9, and a second position, as shown in FIG. 10.  In the first position, the first pair
of engagement structures 64 of the tray member 52 are disposed within the first channel 40 and are engaged with the first pair of retainer structures 54a.  Similarly, the second pair of engagement structures 66 of the tray member 52 are disposed within
the second channel 54 and are engaged with the third pair of retainer structures 54c when the tray member 52 is in the first position.  In this manner, a space is defined between the second side 62 of the tray member 52 and the third wall 36 along the
first channel 40 and the second channel 44.  This defines a first storage area in which hanging files may be stored between the third wall 36 and the tray member 52 when the tray member 52 is disposed within the compartment 20 and in the first position.
 In the second position, the first pair of engagement structures 64 of the tray member 52 is disposed within the first channel 40 and is engaged with the second pair of retainer structures 54b.  Similarly, the second pair of engagement structures
66 of the tray member 52 are disposed within the second channel 44 and are engaged with the fourth pair of retainer structures 54d such that a second space is defined between the first side 60 of the tray member 52 and the fourth wall 38 along the first
channel 40 and the second channel 44.  This provides a second storage area for hanging files within the compartment 20 when the tray member 52 is disposed in the second position within the compartment 20 of the console 10.
 Herein, the engagement structures 64, 66, the slots 76 and/or the grooves 79 are described as cooperating with respective portions of the first channel 40 and the second channel 44 to restrain movement of the tray member 52 with respect to the
console 10 in the first or longitudinal direction, while the engagement structures 64, 66 are described as cooperating with the retainer structures 54a-54d to restrain movement of the tray member 52 with respect to the console 10 in the second or lateral
direction.  However, it should be understood that any of these elements could be reoriented to provide restraint in any desired direction.  For example, the engagement structures 64, 66 and the retainer structures 54a-54d could be rotated 90 degrees such
that they cooperate to restrain movement of the tray member 52 with respect to the console 10 in the first or longitudinal direction.
 In use, a user may install the tray member 52 within the compartment 20 of the console 10 of the vehicle 12 in the first position or the second position.  Alternatively, the user could remove the tray member 52 from the compartment 20 of the
console 10 and then utilize the compartment 20 without the tray member 52.
 While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments but, on the
contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, which scope is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and
equivalent structures as is permitted under the law.

 ",,"TECHNICAL FIELD
 The disclosure relates to the field of storage within motor vehicles, and more particularly, to tool mounting assemblies for motor vehicles.
BACKGROUND
 Motor vehicles are typically provided with a spare tire and tools for changing a tire in the event that one of the tires of the vehicle requires replacement.  These tools often include a jack, a jack handle, and a wrench.  The tools may further
include a hoist handle that is used to operate a tire hoist that stores a spare tire underneath the body of the vehicle, as commonly found on trucks and vans.
 During design of a vehicle, a location must be provided for storing the tools.  In cars having a trunk, the tire is typically stored in a well that is defined beneath a removable panel in the trunk, and the tools are often stored in that area as

 In certain trucks, sport utility vehicles, and vans, it is necessary to store the tools within the passenger compartment or within an area that is contiguous with the passenger compartment.  Thus, the tools must be stored in a secure manner,
such that they do not become dislodged in the case of an abrupt change in acceleration.  Also, the tools should be mounted such that they may be easily removed when they are needed.  Finally, to the extent that the tools are exposed to the passenger
compartment, aesthetic considerations dictate that the manner of storage be attractive, as not to detract from the aesthetics of the passenger compartment of the vehicle.
SUMMARY
 Tool mounting assemblies for motor vehicles are taught herein.
 One tool mounting assembly includes a vehicle body structure, a first storage container portion that is configured to receive at least one jack operation tool, and a second storage container portion that is fixed to the first storage container
portion and is configured to receive at least one wheel chock.  A first bracket is attached to the vehicle body structure and fully surrounds the first storage container portion in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal
direction of the first storage container portion.  A second bracket is attached to the vehicle body structure and at least partially surrounds the first storage container portion.  The second storage container portion is positioned between the first
bracket and the second bracket.
 Another tool mounting assembly includes a vehicle body structure, a first storage bag, a second storage bag, an upper bracket and a lower bracket.
 The first storage bag is configured to receive at least one jack operation tool.  The second storage bag is fixed to the first storage bag and is configured to receive a first wheel chock and a second wheel chock.  The first storage bag extends
from a first end to a second end in a longitudinal direction, and the second storage bag is fixed to the first storage bag such that it is spaced apart from both the first end and the second end of the first storage bag.
 An upper bracket is attached to the vehicle body structure and at least partially surrounds the first storage bag.  A circumference of the upper bracket corresponds to a circumference of the first storage bag.  A lower bracket is attached to the

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 FIG. 1 shows a tool mounting assembly 10 for a motor vehicle.  The tool mounting assembly 10 includes a vehicle body structure 12 of the motor vehicle, a storage container 30, an upper bracket 42, and a lower bracket 44.
 The vehicle body structure 12 includes a structural pillar of the motor vehicle, such as a rearmost structural pillar 14 (e.g., a D-pillar) of the motor vehicle.  The rearmost structural pillar 14 is generally upright, and extends upward from a
floor 16 of the motor vehicle, and is located at a rear corner of the vehicle where a rear door 18 and a side wall 22 meet.  The rearmost structural pillar 14 provides structural support to the side wall 22 and the rear door 18.
 The rear door 18 is hingedly connected to a first side 20 of the rearmost structural pillar 14 for pivotal motion of the rear door 18 with respect to the rearmost structural pillar 14.  The side wall 22 is connected to the rearmost structural
pillar 14 at a second side 24 thereof, opposite the first side 20.  When the rear door 18 is in a closed position, the rear door 18 and the side wall 22 could extend substantially perpendicular to one another.
 A jack 26 is disposed adjacent to the rearmost structural pillar 14 of the motor vehicle and is supported by the floor 16 of the motor vehicle.  The jack 26 may also be adjacent to the side wall 22 of the motor vehicle.  The jack 26 could be any
conventional type of jack for partially lifting vehicles, such as a conventional bottle jack.  The jack 26 could include retaining structures 28 that support and secure the jack 26 with respect to the floor 16 of the motor vehicle.
 The storage container 30 is configured to receive one or more tools (not shown in FIGS. 1-2).  The storage container 30 has an upper portion 32, a lower portion 34, and a central portion 36.  The central portion 36 of the storage container 30
could have a circumference that is greater than the circumference of the upper portion 32 as well as the lower portion 34.  As will be explained further herein, the storage container 30 could be defined by first and second storage container portions,
such as a first storage bag 38 and a second storage bag 40 that is fixed to the first storage bag 38.  The upper portion 32 and the lower portion 34 of the storage container 30 are each defined solely by the first storage bag 38.  The central portion 36
of the storage container 30 is defined by the first storage bag 38 and the second storage bag 40 in combination.
 The upper bracket 42 is attached to the vehicle body structure 12 and at least partially surrounds the upper portion 32 of the storage container 30.  The lower bracket 44 is spaced from the upper bracket.  For example, the lower bracket 44 could
be spaced from the upper bracket 42 vertically along the rearmost structural pillar 14 of the motor vehicle.  The lower bracket 44 is attached to the vehicle body structure 12 and at least partially surrounds the lower portion 34 of the storage container
30.  Thus, the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 each at least partially surround the first storage bag 38, and the second storage bag 40 is positioned between the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44.
 The upper bracket 42 has a circumference that corresponds to the circumference of the upper portion 32 of the storage container 30, and the lower bracket 44 has a circumference that corresponds to the circumference of the lower portion 34 of the
storage container 30.  A circumference of the second storage bag 40 is larger than the circumference of each of the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44.
 The upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 are positioned with respect to the vehicle body structure 12, such as the rearmost structural pillar 14, such that the storage container 30 is secured by the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44
in a generally upright orientation.  The upper and lower brackets 42, 44 could be configured to secure the storage container 30 in a substantially vertical orientation.  The upper and lower brackets 42, 44 could be aligned along a bracket axis 130 that
is generally upright or substantially vertical.
 The upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 could be positioned with respect to the rearmost structural pillar 14 of the motor vehicle such that the lower portion 34 of the storage container 30 contacts the floor 16 of the motor vehicle, and
is disposed adjacent to the jack 26.  For example, the lower portion of the storage container 30 could be positioned between the jack 26 and the rearmost structural pillar 14 of the motor vehicle.  The central portion 36 of the storage container 30 is
positioned directly above and at least partially overhangs the jack 26, such that the jack 26 is at least partially disposed between the central portion 36 of the storage container 30 and the floor 16 of the motor vehicle.
 As shown in FIGS. 3-5, the storage container 30 includes the first storage bag 38 and the second storage bag 40.  The first storage bag 38 is connected to the second storage bag 40.  The first storage bag 38 could be permanently affixed to the
second storage bag 40.  For example, the first storage bag 38 and the second storage bag 40 could be sewn together.
 The first storage bag 38 and the second storage bag 40 are each fabricated from a flexible material.  For example, the first storage bag 38 and the second storage bag 40 could be fabricated from fabric materials, either natural or synthetic.  As
another example, the first storage bag 38 and the second storage bag 40 could be fabricated from plastic or rubber materials.  In this case the first storage bag 38 and the second storage bag could be integrally formed.  These examples are not
necessarily limiting, and other materials could be utilized.
 The first storage bag 38 is configured to receive at least one jack operation tool 46A-46D.  The second storage bag 40 is configured to receive at least one wheel chock, such as a first wheel chock 48A and a second wheel chock 48B.  The first
storage bag 38 and the second storage bag 40 are configured to prevent the at least one jack operation tool 46A-46D and the wheel chocks 48A-48B from contacting one another.
 The first storage bag 48 extends from a first end 54 to a second end 56.  The first end 54 of the first storage bag 38 is located on the upper portion 32 of the storage container 30.  The second end 56 of the first storage bag 38 is located on
the lower portion 34 of the storage container 30.  The first storage bag 38 defines a first compartment 58 and a second compartment 60.
 The first compartment 58 and the second compartment 60 of the first storage bag 38 have open ends that are disposed at the second end 56.  The first storage bag 38 includes a flap 62 that is moveable between open and closed positions.  The flap
62 is adjacent to the open ends of the first compartment 58 and the second compartment 60.  The first storage bag 38 includes a hook-and-loop fastener 64 that is operable to secure the flap 62 in the closed position.
 The first storage bag 38 could be defined by a plurality of panels, such as a first panel 50 and a second panel 52.  The first panel 50 and the second panel 52 are sewn together to define the first compartment 58 and the second compartment 60. 
The second compartment 60 could also be further subdivided into additional compartments using additional panels 61A and 61B in order to prevent jack operation tools 46A-46C from contacting one another.
 The first storage bag 38 is attached to the second storage bag 40 at a first lateral edge 66 and a second lateral edge 68 of the storage container 30.  For example, the first storage bag 38 could be connected to the second storage bag 40 by a
first seam 70 that is positioned adjacent to the first lateral edge 66 of the storage container 30 and by a second seam 72 that is positioned adjacent to the second lateral edge 68 of the storage container 30.  The first seam 70 and the second seam 72
extend along a longitudinal direction of the storage container 30, and extend from the first end 54 of the first storage bag 38 to a second end 56 of the first storage bag 38.
 The first panel 50 and the second panel 52 of the first storage bag 38 are connected to one another by the first seam 70, a third seam 74, and a fourth seam 76.  The third seam 74 and the fourth seam 76 extend along the longitudinal direction of
the storage container 30, and extend from the first end 54 of the first storage bag 38 toward the second end 56 of the first storage bag 38, and terminate at the open ends of the first compartment 58 and the second compartment 60 of the first storage bag
38.
 The first seam 70 is positioned at the first lateral edge 66 of the storage container 30 and passes through the first panel 50 and the second panel 52 of the first storage bag 38, as well as through one or more panels of the second storage bag
40.  The second seam 72 passes through the first panel 50 of the first storage bag 38, as well as through one or more panels of the second storage bag 40.  The third seam 74 passes through the first panel 50 and the second panel 52 of the first storage
bag 38 adjacent to a terminal edge 78 of the second panel 52.  The fourth seam 76 passes through the first panel 50 and the second panel 52 at a location that is disposed between the first seam 70 and the third seam 74.
 The first compartment 60 is defined between the first panel 50 and the second panel 52 between the first seam 70 and the fourth seam 76.  The second compartment 60 is defined by the first panel 50 and the second panel 52 between the third seam
74 and the fourth seam 76.  A bridge panel portion 78 is defined solely by the first panel 50 and extends between the second seam 72 and the third seam 74, from the second lateral edge 68 of the storage bag 30 to the second compartment 60 of the first
storage bag 38.
 The second storage bag 40 extends from a first end 80 to a second end 82.  The second storage bag 40 could be defined by one or more panels that are fixed to one another.  For example, the first storage bag 40 could be defined by a first panel
86 and a second panel 88.
 The second storage bag 40 defines a third compartment 90.  The third compartment 90 is defined at least partially by the third panel 86 and the fourth panel 88 in cooperation with one another.  The third compartment 90 has an open end that is
positioned adjacent to the first end 80 of the second storage bag 40.  The second storage bag 40 could include a flap 92 that is moveable between open and closed positions with respect to the open end of the third compartment 90.  The flap 92 could be
defined by part of either of the third panel 86 or the fourth panel 88.  A hook-and-loop fastener 94 is provided to secure the flap 92 in a closed position.
 The third panel 86 and the fourth panel 88 are connected to one another.  The third panel 86 and the fourth panel 88 could be permanently affixed to one another.  For example, the third panel 86 and the fourth panel 88 could be sewn together at
the first seam 70 and the second seam 72.  Thus, the first seam 70 could extend through the third and fourth panels 86, 88 of the second storage bag 40, as well as through one or more panels of the first storage bag 38.  Likewise, the second seam 72
could extend through the third and fourth panels 86, 88 of the second storage bag 40, as well as through one or more panels of the first storage bag 38.
 The first wheel chock 48A and the second wheel chock 48B are received within the third compartment 90.  A moveable barrier in the form of a divider flap 96 is fixed to an interior surface of the second storage bag 40.  For example, the divider
flap 96 could be fixed to the third panel 86 of the second storage bag 40 by a seam 98.  The divider flap 96 is positionable between the first wheel chock 48A and the second wheel chock 48B to prevent the first wheel chock 48A and the second wheel chock
48B from directly contacting one another.  By preventing direct contact between the first wheel chock 48A and the second wheel chock 48B, the divider flap 96 minimizes or eliminates rattle noise emanating from the first wheel chock 48A and the second
wheel chock 48B during operation of the vehicle.
 The second panel 52 of the first storage bag 38 has an exterior surface 100 and the third panel 86 of the second storage bag 40 has an exterior surface 102.  In the area between the first and second lateral edges 66, 68 of the storage container
30, as well as between the first seam 70 and the second seam 72, the exterior surface 100 of the first storage bag 38 is in contact with the exterior surface 102 of the second storage bag 40.
 The storage container 30 includes a first retainer strap 104 and a second retainer strap 106.  The first and second retainer straps 104, 106 are each fixed to one of the first storage bag 38 or the second storage bag 40, and in the illustrated
embodiment are fixed to the first storage bag 38 by seams 108.  The first retainer strap 104 and the second retainer strap 106 each extend around both the first storage bag 38 and the second storage bag 40 to secure the first storage bag 38 with respect
to the second storage bag 40.
 The first retainer strap 104 is positioned in alignment with the first wheel chock 48A.  The second retainer strap 106 is positioned in alignment with the second wheel chock 48B.  The first retainer strap is engageable with the second storage
bag 40 adjacent to the first wheel chock 48A.  The second retainer strap 106 is engageable with the second storage bag 40 adjacent to the second wheel chock 48B.
 The first retainer strap 104 and the second retainer strap 106 each include a tensioning structure, such as a first tensioning structure 110 of the first retainer strap 104 and a second tensioning structure 112 of the second retainer strap 106. 
The first and second tensioning structures 110, 112 are operable to tighten and release the first and second retainer straps 104, 106, respectively.  The first and second tensioning structures 110, 112 could be in the form of two-part strap buckles that
allow the first and second retainer straps 104, 106 to be tensioned as well as released by separation of the parts of the two-part strap buckles.
 By provision of the first retainer strap 104 and the second retainer strap 106, the second storage bag 40 can be secured with respect to the first storage bag 38.  This prevents motion of the wheel chocks 48A, 48B with respect to the jack tools
46A-46D.  This also reduces the stress imposed upon the first seam 70 and the second seam 72 in response to dynamic loading experienced by the storage container 30.
 The upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 can be substantially identical in construction and will be described with reference to the upper bracket 42.  As shown in FIGS. 6-8, the upper bracket 42 includes a mounting portion 120 and a
retaining portion 122.  When assembled, the retaining portion 122 of the upper bracket 42 at least partially surrounds the upper portion 32 of the storage container 30, and may fully surround the upper portion 32 of the storage container 30.  When
assembled, the retaining portion 122 of the lower bracket 44 at least partially surrounds the lower portion 34 of the storage container 30, and may fully surround the lower portion 34 of the storage container 30.  Additionally, either or both of the
upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 could fully surround the storage container 30 in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal direction of the first storage bag 38 of the storage container 30.  The mounting portions 120 of
the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 are, when assembled, attached to the vehicle body structure 12.
 The retaining portions 122 of the upper and lower brackets 42, 44 each include a base flange 124 that is connected to a first arm 126 by a hinge 128.  The first arm 126 pivots with respect to the base flange 124 between a closed position and an
open position.  The first arm 126 could pivot with respect to the base flange 124 in a plane that is substantially perpendicular to the bracket axis 130 (FIG. 2) that is defined between the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44.
 The retaining portion 122 of each of the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 also includes a second arm 132 and a third arm 134.  The second arm 132 is opposite the base flange 124, and is spaced from the base flange 124 by the third arm
134.  In combination, the base flange 124, the first arm 126, the second arm 132, and the third arm 134 may define a closed cross-sectional shape for the retaining portion 122 of each of the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44.  For example, the
base flange 124 and the first through third arms 126, 132, 134 could define a closed polygon, such as a trapezoid.  Thus, the retaining portion 122 defines an opening 136 that is surrounded by the base flange 124, the first arm 126, the second arm 132,
and the third arm 134.  The opening 136 is configured to receive a portion of the first storage bag 38, such as the upper portion 32 of the storage container 30 or the lower portion 34 of the storage container 30, each of which are defined by the first
storage bag 38.
 The second arm 132 of the retaining portion 122 of each of the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 includes a main portion 138 that extends outward from the third arm 134 and an attachment portion 140 that is opposite the third arm 134 and
extends at an angle with respect to the main portion 138 of the second arm 132.  When the upper or lower bracket 42, 44 is in its closed position, the attachment portion 140 of the second arm 132 and the first arm 126 are in a substantially coplanar
relationship and are positioned adjacent to one another.
 To connect the first arm 126 to the attachment portion 140 of the second arm 132, a fastener 142 is provided at an outboard end of the first arm 126, opposite the hinge 128.  For example, the fastener 142 could be a bolt having a head and a
threaded shaft or any other suitable fastener.  The fastener 142 extends through an aperture that is formed through the first arm 126 and is retained on the first arm 126 by a retainer member 146 that resists removal of the fastener 142 from the first
arm 126 when the respective one of the upper bracket 42 or the lower bracket 44 is in the open position to positively retain the fastener 142 on the first arm 126.  The second arm 132 defines a threaded aperture 148 that is formed through the attachment
portion 140 of the second arm 132.  The second arm 132 also defines extruded threads that are formed on the periphery of the threaded aperture 148 and are threadedly engageable with the fastener 142 of the first arm 126 in order to secure the first arm
126 with respect to the second arm 132 in the closed position.
 The mounting portion 120 includes a mounting surface 150 having a fastener aperture 152 formed therethrough.  A fastener 154 is receivable in the fastener aperture 152 and is engageable with the rearmost structural pillar 14 or other portion of
the vehicle body structure 12 in order to secure each of the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 with respect to the vehicle body structure 12.
 A flange 156 extends outward from the mounting surface 150 and may extend substantially perpendicular to the mounting surface 150.  The flange 156 is received within an aperture 158 that is defined by a portion of the vehicle body structure 12,
such as the rearmost structural pillar 14.  Engagement of the flange 154 with the rearmost structural pillar 14 in the aperture 158 aids positioning and alignment of each of the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 during assembly, and restrains
rotation of each of the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 with respect to the rearmost structural pillar 14 of the vehicle.
 The mounting portion 120 includes an offset bend 160 that connects the mounting surface 150 to the base flange 124 of the retaining portion 122.  The offset bend 160 may extend through a radius of approximately 90.degree.  and interconnects the
mounting portion 120 and the retaining portion 122 such that the base flange 124 and the mounting surface 150 extend substantially parallel with respect to one another but are offset with respect to one another.  Thus, the base flange 124 could extend
substantially parallel to the rearmost structural pillar 14 of the vehicle, but at the same time be spaced apart therefrom.
 Although the structure described above is suitable for both the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44, it should be understood that the upper and lower brackets 42, 44 could, alternatively, be any suitable attachment mechanism now known or
later developed that is configured to fully or partially surround either of the upper portion 32 or the lower portion 34 of the storage container 30.  For example, the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 could be either rigid or flexible; the upper
bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 could be either hinged or unhinged; and the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 could each be either of a one-piece structure or a multiple piece structure.
 In use, the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 are installed with respect to the rearmost structural pillar 14 of the vehicle.  The upper and lower brackets 42, 44 are moved to their opened positions, and the storage container 30 is
received within the openings 136 of the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44 such that the central portion 36 of the storage container 30 is disposed between the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44.  The upper and lower brackets 42, 44 are
moved to their closed positions, and the storage container is secured by the upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44.  If the upper and lower brackets 42, 44 are again moved to their opened positions, the storage container 30 is then removable from the
upper bracket 42 and the lower bracket 44.
 The foregoing description relates to what is presently considered to be the most practical embodiment.  It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments but, on the contrary, is intended to
cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims, which scope is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures as is
permitted under the law.

",,"FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention relates to a door having an automotive-style handle and locking mechanism for a refrigerated trailer.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 A prior art refrigerated trailer includes a body formed from a pair of rectangular sidewalls, at least one door provided in a sidewall, a front wall, a rear frame, at least one door supported in the rear frame, a roof or top panel, and a floor
structure.  The doors are hingedly mounted by hinges.  The body defines an interior cargo compartment for carrying cargo.  A refrigeration unit is mounted in the front wall and provides conditioned air to the interior cargo compartment.  The floor
structure may be supported by conventional axles and wheels, or may be supported by a rear undercarriage assembly and a landing gear.  The trailer can be connected to a tractor having a cab by conventional means, such as a fifth wheel assembly.  Each of
the sidewalls, front wall and roof includes a foamed plastic core between first and second skins formed from fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) (this structure is commonly known in the industry as a composite plate).
 Conventional door lock mechanisms include an elongated, cylindrical lockrod which extends along the height of the respective door.  A generally U-shaped bearing plate is provided proximate each end of the lockrod and the bearing plates are
secured to the respective door by fasteners, such as rivets.  The lockrod rotates within the bearing plates, and a handle is provided for manipulating the position of the lockrod.  The handle is provided partway up the lockrod on the respective door.  A
cam which is integrally formed at each end of the lockrod is configured to engage corresponding keeper on the body, thereby locking the doors into a closed position.  Each keeper is attached to the body by suitable means, such as a weldment.  Brackets
are typically provided on the doors for engaging and securing the handles.  Typically, the brackets are configured such that padlocks can be engaged with the brackets, thereby locking the handles in place on the doors (and thereby locking the doors in
the closed position).
 Because the handles are provided partway up the doors and extend outwardly from the doors, when the doors are swung to the open position, the handles may bear against the body, possibly causing damage.  In addition, the handles are large and
heavy, which makes the handles difficult for an operator to use.
 The present disclosure provides a locking mechanism which addresses various disadvantages presented by the prior art.  Other features and advantages will become apparent upon a reading of the attached specification, in combination with a study
of the drawings.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention recognizes and addresses considerations of prior art constructions and methods.  One embodiment of a door for a refrigerated trailer includes a door pan formed of fiberglass reinforced plastic, the door pan having an inner
surface and an outer surface.  A door sheet is formed of fiberglass reinforced plastic and has an inner surface and an outer surface.  A foamed plastic core is provided between the inner surfaces of the door pan and the door sheet.  A housing is mounted
between the inner surfaces of the door pan and the door sheet and is substantially encapsulated within the foamed plastic core.  An automotive-style handle and locking mechanism is mounted to the housing.
 In another embodiment, a refrigerated trailer includes a body defining an interior cargo compartment, a refrigeration unit mounted on the body for providing conditioned air to the interior cargo compartment, and at least one door hingedly
mounted to the body.  The at least one door includes a door pan formed of fiberglass reinforced plastic, the door pan having an inner surface and an outer surface, a door sheet formed of fiberglass reinforced plastic having an inner surface and an outer
surface, a foamed plastic core provided between the inner surfaces of the door pan and the door sheet, a housing mounted between the inner surfaces of the door pan and the door sheet and substantially encapsulated within the foamed plastic core, and an
automotive-style handle and locking mechanism mounted to the housing.
 In another embodiment, a method of forming a door for a refrigerated trailer includes providing a door pan formed of fiberglass reinforced plastic, providing a door sheet formed of fiberglass reinforced plastic, attaching the door pan to the
door sheet such that a space is formed therebetween, cutting an access aperture into the door pan such that the space can be accessed, inserting a housing through the access aperture in the door pan and securing the housing to the door sheet, mounting a
wire through the door pan and the housing, injecting foam into the space, thereby substantially encapsulating the housing within the foam, cutting aligned holes through the door pan and the housing, cutting an access aperture through the door sheet,
inserting an automotive-style handle and locking mechanism through the access aperture in the door sheet, mounting the automotive-style handle and locking mechanism to the housing and the wire and at least through the aligned holes, inserting a foam plug
through the access opening in the door pan, and attaching a panel over the access opening in the door pan.

the three-sided flange 214 of the inner backing plate 174 to form an enclosure in which at least a portion of the automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 is seated.  The inner backing plate 174 and the outer backing plate 176 are suitably
secured together, for example by adhesive, to form the latch housing 180.
 The base wall 210 of the inner backing plate 174 is proximate to the access opening 198 in the door pan 166.  The side wall 220 of the outer backing plate 176 seats against the legs 172c, 172d of the backing channel 172.
 The automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 is a standard automotive handle and lock constructed for opening and closing an automobile side door which is known in the art.  The automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 is
mounted to the outer backing 176 and is accessed through access aperture 204 in the door sheet 168.
 The automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 includes a handle base 230 seated in aperture 228 and a handle 232 swing ably connected to the handle base 230.  The handle 232 has a horizontally long shape and one end thereof is swingably
connected to the handle base 230.  The handle 232 is mounted to the door sheet 168 such that its axis of rotation is perpendicular to the height of the door 34.  The handle 232 is swingable between its initial position in which an outer surface of the
handle 232 lies substantially flush with the door sheet 168, and its opening position reached when the handle 232 is pulled away from the door sheet 168.
 The automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 also includes known mechanical and electronic assemblies 234 for interconnecting the handle 232 and the locking assembly on the trailer when the door 34 is in the closed and locked position. 
The mechanical and electronic assemblies 234 preferably includes a receiver 236 for receiving signals for unlocking/locking the automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 as is known in the art, a key hole 238 into which a key is inserted for
manually locking/unlocking the door 34, and a linkage 240 (see FIG. 6 which shows the outer backing plate 176 as transparent so the inner components can be seen) which extends through the access hole 222 in the outer backing plate 176.  The receiver 236
may be wired to locks in the tractor/cab to receive signals therefrom (which may be generated by a key fob).  The linkage 240 is connected to a rotary strike 242 that is seated within the recessed portion 190c.  This rotary strike 242 interacts with a
corresponding lock (not shown) on the body 22 to maintain the door 34 in the closed and locked position as is known in the art.  The handle 132 can be easily grasped by a user and pulled to open the door 34 in the same way that a car door handle is
activated.
 A wire 244 (shown broken in FIGS. 4 and 5) is inserted through a receptacle in the wire access hole 196 and is in electrical connection with the automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152.  The wire 244 provides electrical signals from
the tractor/cab to the automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 and supplies power from the power supply in the tractor/cab or on the trailer to the automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152.
 Now that the specifics of the door 34 have been described, the method of forming the door 34 is described.
 The access aperture 198 is cut into the base wall 182 of the door pan 166.  The backing channels 170, 172 are mounted in the recess 186 of the door pan 166 and are secured thereto by suitable means, such as adhesive.
 The door pan 166 is attached to the door sheet 168 by suitable means, for example by adhesive, and clamped in a press.  Thereafter, the door sheet 168 is trimmed to conform to the shape of the lip 188 on the door pan 166.
 The outer backing plate 176 is attached to the inner backing plate 174 by suitable means, for example by adhesive, and the latch housing 180 is formed.  The wiring aperture is drilled into the inner backing plate 174.
 Next, the access aperture 204 is cut into the door sheet 168.  The latch housing 180 is inserted through the access aperture 198 in the door pan 166 and using the access aperture 204 in the door sheet 168, the latch housing 180 is properly
positioned within the recess 186 using an alignment plug (not shown).  When properly positioned, the apertures 224, 226, 228 in the outer backing plate 176 align with the access aperture 204 in the door sheet 168.  The outer backing plate 176 is secured
to the door sheet 168 by suitable means, for example by adhesive.
 The wire access hole 196 is drilled in the base wall 182 of the door pan 166 and the wiring receptacle is inserted therethrough.  The wire 244 is run into the inner backing plate 174 through the wiring aperture.  Thereafter, the wiring aperture
in the inner backing plate 174 is sealed by suitable means by a user through the access aperture 204.  As a result, the enclosure formed by the latch housing 180 is completely separated from the remainder of the interior space between the door pan 166
and the door sheet 168.
 A foaming plug (not shown) is then installed in the access aperture 198 in the door pan 166.  Foam is injected into the recess 186 through the foaming plug by suitable known means.  The door 34, along with the door foaming equipment, preferably
contains foam with a foam expansion pressure of 8 PSI.  This provides sufficient structural rigidity to the resulting door 34.  As a result, the latch housing 180 is substantially encapsulated by foam on three sides.  The remaining side of the latch
housing 180 abuts against the FRP door sheet 168.
 Next, the strike hole 194 in the door pan 166 and the access hole 222 in the outer backing plate 176 are cut by suitable means and in this process, any foam in this pathway is removed.
 The automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 is then inserted through the access aperture 204 in the door sheet 168 and is mounted to the inner backing plate 174 by suitable means, such as adhesive.  The automotive-style handle and
locking mechanism 152 is connected to wire 244.  The linkage 240 is installed through the aligned holes 194, 222.  A rotary strike gasket 246 is installed into the strike hole 194 and the rotary strike 242 is installed therein and connected to the
linkage 240.  The handle 232 and base 230 are mounted through the access aperture 204 in the door sheet 168.  A cover plate 250 is secured to the outer surface of the door sheet 168 to cover the access aperture 204.
 A foam plug 248 is inserted through the access opening 198 to encapsulate the remainder of the automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 on its inner side.  The access panel 202 seats over the access opening 198 and is attached thereto
by suitable means, such as adhesive.  Thereafter, the hinges 36 are installed and the completed door 34 is attached to the body 22.
 The door 34 can be unlock by pressing the ""Unlock"" button on the key fob or using the keyed lock 238 on the automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152.  The handle 232 is pulled to release the automotive-style handle and locking mechanism
152 and thereafter, is used to pull the door 34 open.  The door 34 can be closed by pushing the door 34 closed to engage automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152.  The door 34 is locked by pressing the ""Lock"" button on the key fob or using the
keyed lock 238 on the automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152.
 The doors 34 formed by the present invention can be up to four, five or six inches thick.  This results in a thicker door 34 than prior art trailer doors, which can result in increased insulating properties.
 The doors 34 are easy to operate and include the aesthetically appealing automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152.  The doors 34 provide ergonomics which potentially result in reduced fatigue and improved efficiencies of delivery route
personnel.  The automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 is lightweight and has a low profile to improve fuel mileage.  The automotive-style handle and locking mechanism 152 can be electronically controlled through a key fob.  The ease and
convenience of the electronic lock decreases the chance of product theft.
 While one or more preferred embodiments of the invention are described above, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope
and spirit thereof.  It is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations as come within the scope and spirit of the appended claims and their equivalents.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention relates in general to storage compartments in motor vehicles, and, more specifically, to an expandable compartment on a door panel.
 Typical automobiles and other transportation vehicles include a variety of storage features such as a compartment located along the bottom interior surface of a vehicle side entry door.  This compartment is commonly referred to as a map pocket. 
This pocket is usually molded from hard plastic as an outward extension from the door panel.  The conventional pocket creates a dedicated space/volume for storage intruding into the passenger area regardless of whether anything is actually stored there. 
Furthermore, the opening is usually not covered which detracts from the overall appearance and may allow items to fall out of the map pocket while driving on bumpy surfaces, for example.  Thus, a closable and retractable map pocket would be desirable.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 In one aspect of the invention, a storage compartment is provided for a transportation vehicle.  The vehicle has a door panel with a recess.  A frame comprises a U-shaped member and a flexible spring piece, wherein the U-shaped member has a
first terminus and a second terminus separated by a predetermined distance.  The flexible spring piece has first and second ends connected to the first terminus and the second terminus, respectively.  The flexible spring piece has a length between the
first and second ends greater than the predetermined distance so that the flexible spring piece tends to assume either a closed position proximate the recess or an open position away from the recess.  A pocket cover has a front portion concealing the
frame and has a folding side portion disposed between side and bottom edges of the frame and the door panel along corresponding edges of the recess.  A tether is coupled to the frame for urging the frame toward the door panel while permitting the frame
to be moved away from the door panel. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 The present invention provides a flexible storage compartment having an upper side that is closable and an outer surface that is expandable to accommodate contents placed therein while minimizing protrusion into the passenger compartment.  The
pocket has a foldable material along the sides and bottom, and includes a soft cover made of PVC, leather, or other material that conforms to the surrounding door panel surfaces when closed thereby providing an improved visual appearance.  A
substantially rigid frame along the sides and bottom of the cover may be constructed of stamped aluminum, or a stiff, injection-molded reinforced plastic resin, for example.  A spring steel member across the top of the U-shaped frame has a length greater
than the distance between the ends of the U-shaped frame in order to provide an opening/closing effect.  Cover material is folded over the frame which also bridges the area between the cover and the door panel when the map pocket is expanded.  Tethers
(such as an elastic cord or mechanical springs) attach the frame to the door panel in order to contract the pocket against the door panel or the contents within the map pocket.  A recess is provided in the door panel in order to obtain a flush fit of the
cover with the door panel when the map pocket is empty.
 Referring now to FIG. 1, a door panel 10 includes a map pocket 11 with an upper edge 12.  A contoured shelf 13 is disposed along upper edge 12 and has a finger notch 14 to create a gap to facilitate grasping of upper edge 12 to pull open map
pocket 11.  Shelf 13 preferably has a concave contoured edge 15 shaped to receive map pocket upper edge 12 when it is closed.  FIG. 2 shows map pocket 11 pulled to an open position creating access to a recess 16 in door panel 10 and the storage space
behind pocket 11.
 The main components of the map pocket are shown in FIG. 3.  A U-shaped member 20 is attached to a flexible spring piece 21.  U-shaped member 20 is substantially rigid and may be comprised of a stamped metal or a molded plastic, for example. 
U-shape member 20 has a first terminus 22 and a second terminus 23 for receiving spring piece 21.  Spring piece 21 has first and second ends 24 and 25 coupled to terminus 22 and terminus 23, respectively.  The length of spring piece 21 between ends 24
and 25 is greater than a distance between terminus 22 and terminus 23.  Thus, spring piece 21 tends to spring to one side or the other between its ends, corresponding to the open and closed positions of the map pocket.
 Spring piece 21 may be connected to U-shaped member 20 via various types of hard connection, such as a weld, a screw, or other fastener.  Preferably, a pivotable connection may be provided by using posts 26 and 27 that are pivotally coupled to
terminus 22 and terminus 23, respectively.  Posts 26 and 27 may include slots (not shown) for receiving ends 24 and 25, thereby allowing spring piece 21 to be moved between its open and closed positions more easily.
 The rectangular frame comprised of U-shaped member 20 and spring piece 21 is retained in a pocket cover 30, including a front portion 31 and a folding side portion 32.  Portions 31 and 32 are preferably constructed of a soft cover stock material
such as PVC, leather, or a durable fabric of a type used in automobile interiors.  Portions 31 and 32 may be a single piece or may be separate pieces as shown in FIG. 3.  The separate pieces may be sewn together, for example.  Front portion 31 is folded
along dashed lines 33 and 34 in order to attach to and conceal U-shaped member 20 and spring piece 21.  After folding, the folds may be glued or sewn in order to permanently retain the frame.
 The map pocket is tethered to the door panel using tethers 35-38.  Each tether has one end connected to the map pocket, e.g., by attaching it to U-shaped member 20 or to a corresponding portion of pocket cover 30 on the outboard side of the
folds (i.e., closest to member 20).  Tethers 35 and 38 connect at the upper ends of the left and right sides of pocket 30, and tethers 36 and 37 connect along the bottom edge of pocket 30.  Tethers 35-38 preferably pass through the door panel and have
their other ends attach to anchor points (not shown) sufficiently removed along the door panel to provide a stretching capacity that accommodates the desired expansion while maintaining an appropriate amount of force for urging the pocket frame toward
the door panel.  The tethers must be sufficiently long to permit the frame to be pulled away from the door panel when inserting contents into the pocket.  Tethers may be preferably comprised of stretchable elastic (commonly referred to as a bungee cord). The majority of the length of the tethers formed of stretchable elastic would be concealed behind the door panel in order to accommodate the desired lengths.  Instead of stretchable elastic, a mechanical spring system or tensioner can be used.
 Each tether can expand independently to achieve different arrangements of contents being placed inside the pocket.  As shown in FIG. 4, upper edge 12 is pulled to an open position and tether 38 is stretched so that cover 30 is expanded along its
upper edge, thereby increasing the opening size for the map pocket.  As shown in FIG. 5, expansion along the bottom edge of the map pocket is obtained by stretching tether 37 in a similar manner.
 FIG. 6 shows a side view of another embodiment in which a door panel 40 has a recess 41.  A frame and pocket cover assembly 42 has a closed, unexpanded position shown at 43.  By pulling on the spring piece of the frame without stretching the
tethers, assembly 42 moves to the open position shown at 44.  By expanding the tethers, frame and pocket cover 42 can be moved to the position shown at 45.
 In the top view of FIG. 7, a tether 46 passes through an opening 47 in door panel 40 proximate an edge of recess 41 and attaches to an anchor point 48 and to frame and pocket cover 42.  Similarly, a tether 50 passes through another opening 51
and attaches to an anchor point 52 and to the opposite side of frame and pocket cover 42 at 53.  The majority of the length of each tether 46 and 50 is disposed between openings 47 and 51 and anchor points 48 and 52, respectively.  The extra length
allows expansion to the position shown at 45 while maintaining a closing force in both positions that urges frame and cover 42 toward door panel 42 at all times, while maintaining the force at an appropriate level to allow expansion away from door panel
40.

 The present invention relates to Tonneau Covers, particularly Tonneau Covers including a flexible cover and an apparatus for attaching the flexible cover to a cargo box of a pick up truck; the apparatus includes a flexible cover securing plate
and securing plate engagement members cooperating to impart tension to the flexible cover when the flexible cover securing plate pivots into or is positioned in a closed position with respect to the securing plate engagement members; and, preferably a
locking member or members preventing unauthorized detachment of the flexible cover securing plate from the securing plate engagement members.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART
 Numerous protective covers for preventing rain, debris and wind from damaging or disrupting the contents of a pickup truck bed are currently available.  Generally, the covers are made of some sort of fabric, often coated with a polymeric
material, which is detachably fastenable to a rigid frame so as to enclose and protect a given area.  The covering materials used are generally stretchable to the extent that once they are in a position, they are pulled taut and then attached to the
frame by numerous methods such as snaps, grommets, or hook-and-loop fasteners and stretcher bars.
 The use of hook-and-loop type fasteners and stretcher bars to fasten a cover to a frame structure forms the subject matter of U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,076,338 ('338 patent) and 5,174,353 ('353 patent) issued to Steven Schmeichel et al., the
disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
 In the Schmeichel et al. patents, an edge portion of a covering fabric is attached to a generally L-shaped end plate or stretcher bar.  The end plate is provided with a peak or crest, which pivotally contacts ends of the frame structure as the
end plate is rotated into a fixed, stretching position.  As the end plate rotates into the fixed, stretching position, an enlarged ridge of the end plate is either captured by a spring loaded lock element as depicted in a first embodiment, or engages and
deflects a biased pawl element as depicted in a second embodiment.  After the enlarged ridge passes the lock or pawl element, the lock or pawl element springs back to its undeflected state thereby maintaining the end plate in the fixed, stretching
position.  In order to move the end plate out of the fixed stretching position, the biasing force of the lock or the pawl element must be overcome.  In the first embodiment, this biasing force may be overcome by the movement of the enlarged ridge as the
end plate is pivoted out of the fixed stretching position.  In the second embodiment, deflection of the pawl is best accomplished by manipulating a release member which projects from a portion of a latching member, or by opening the tailgate and manually
disengaging the pawl from the enlarged ridge.
 Although the Schmeichel et al. patents teach a number of significant improvements over the prior art, there are several limitations of the prior art, which are addressed and improved upon by the present invention.
 One limitation of the first embodiment of the Schmeichel et al. patents, as depicted, is that the L-shaped lock member, by virtue of its resilient nature, merely imparts a dynamic force, which tends to maintain the end plate in the fixed
stretching position.  This force, however, can be overcome by the action of the enlarged ridge as it moves past the inclined portion of the L-shaped lock.  Thus, the L-shaped lock does not function as a lock in a conventional sense.
 A limitation of the second embodiment of the Schmeichel et al. patents is in the location and construction of the lock element.  As depicted, the lock element comprises a pawl element, which is attached to one end of an elongated leaf spring. 
The other end of the leaf spring is attached to a connector, which in turn is connected to a side rail of the support frame structure.  While this embodiment functions to lock the end plate and support frame structure in the fixed stretching position, it
would appear that absent support, the pawl element may be forcibly disengaged and/or damaged by forcible movement of the end plate out of the fixed, stretching position.
 Another limitation of the second embodiment of the Schmeichel et al. patents is that the flexible cover securing plate may be disengaged from the lock member by a person with knowledge of the location of the release member.
 A limitation common to both the first and second embodiments of the Schmeichel et al. patents regards the attachment point and the design of the engagement member (or strike) which engages the flexible cover securing plate.  As depicted in the
drawings the strike is attached to the frame structure by a fastening element located a substantial distance from the inclined portion of the strike.  This allows the strike to be flexed or bent upwardly in reaction to the stress forces exerted on the
strike when the flexible cover securing plate is pivoted into and out of the fixed stretching position.  Repeated flexure and/or bending may result in loosening and/or premature failure of the strike.  Additionally, the strike includes a relatively thin
lip portion which extends beyond the body of the strike and which rotatingly contacts the flexible cover securing plate as it is pivoted into and out of the fixed stretching position.  This lip portion is subject to high amounts of stress and is subject
to flexure and/or bending which may lead to premature failure.
 Another limitation common to both the first and second embodiments of the Schmeichel et al. patents is in the attachment of the support frame about the perimeter of a cargo box of the vehicle.  In Schmeichel et al., a support frame is attached
to an inner side-wall by a C-shaped clamp.  The effectiveness of the clamp may, however, become compromised by overtightening the clamping bolt and may lead to deformation and/or failure the body of the clamp.  Additionally, due to the tapered vertical
attachment portion of the frame support, there is a tendency for the clamp to become dislodged from the clamping position.
 The present invention provides improvements which address these and other limitations associated with the prior art.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 Preferred embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a tonneau cover apparatus for attaching and locking a flexible cover about a cargo box of a vehicle, such as a pickup truck.  The tonneau cover apparatus comprises a flexible
cover and a support frame for attachment to the cargo box.  The support frame has two opposing side rails, each having a lock engaging surface.  When in use, each opposing side rail is secured to respective opposing side walls of the cargo box.  The
support frame further includes a pair of securing plate engagement members, each of which can be secured to one of the respective opposing side rails.
 The preferred tonneau cover apparatus further comprises a flexible cover securing plate attached to the flexible cover.  The flexible cover securing plate has first and second ends and a channel extending from the first end to the second end. 
The flexible cover securing plate is engageable with the respective securing plate engagement members.  The flexible cover securing plate additionally includes at least one locking member that is slidably secured within the channel proximate one of the
ends of the flexible cover securing plate.  The locking member is preferably spring biased and there will preferably be one at each end of the securing plate.  When the locking members are in the first position, each respective locking member is engaged
with a lock engaging surface of the respective opposing side rail and the flexible cover securing plate is secured to each respective side rail.  In the first position, the respective flexible cover securing plate is prevented from pivoting or
disengaging with respect to the respective side rail.  When the locking members are in a second position, the flexible cover securing plate can pivot and disengage with respect to the respective side rail.
 These and various other advantages and features of novelty which characterize the present invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and forming a part hereof.  However, for a better understanding of the invention,
its advantages and objects obtained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to the accompanying descriptive matter, in which there is illustrated and described a preferred embodiment of the present

latched position by a compression spring 980 pushing the locking member 960 to such position rather than operating in the manner the tension spring 774 shown in FIG. 17, that biases the locking member 760 by pulling on it.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
 Referring now to the drawings, and specifically FIGS. 1-10, there is illustrated a preferred embodiment of the present invention, wherein reference numeral 6 designates a vehicle, preferably a pickup truck, reference numeral 8 designates a
preferred tonneau cover apparatus and reference numeral 10 designates the flexible cover.  FIG. 1 illustrates a flexible cover 10 in use on a cargo box 11 of a pickup truck 6 having two outer sidewalls 12, each having an inner sidewall 14 (shown in FIG.
8), a forward end 13 and a tailgate 16, preferably with a release handle and lock mechanism 18, actuated with a key (not shown) or, alternatively, a remotely actuated lock mechanism, having a remote keyless actuator (not shown), like those which are now
well known in the art.  As depicted, the flexible cover 10 is covering a top of a perimeter of the cargo box 11 of the pickup truck 6.  The flexible cover 10 is secured to a front plate 19 and an flexible cover securing_plate 20 each of which are secured
to support frame 104 that includes rails 106 which are clamped to the respective sidewalls 12 of the pickup truck 6.
 FIG. 2 shows the preferred tonneau cover apparatus 8, including the flexible, stretchable fabric cover 10, separated from the pickup truck.  The rearward end of the flexible cover is attached to an elongated flexible cover securing plate 20
having a plate cap 90 with an exterior surface 92.  The other end of the flexible cover 10 is preferably attached to the front plate 19 (shown in FIG. 1) in a manner similar to that disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,906,407 to Schmeichel ('407 patent), the
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.  The front plate 19 is preferably secured to the respective side rails 106 in an equivalent or similar manner that is disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,076,338, the disclosure of which is
hereby incorporated by reference, or in other Schmeichel patents that are incorporated herein by reference.  In preferred embodiments, the front plate 19 will be secured to the respective side rails 106 in the manner disclosed in the '407 patent.  The
flexible cover 10 is preferably made of a resilient fabric material, which is preferably laminated to a polyester sheet to give it strength, flexibility, additional resilience, and water resistance.
 The preferred tonneau cover apparatus 8 is secured to the sidewalls 12 of the pickup truck 6 using clamps 130 (see FIGS. 3 and 8), which secure the respective side rails 106 to the inner wall 14, which is an extension of the sidewall 12.  The
front plate 19 is secured to the respective side rails 106 as described above and the flexible cover securing plate 20 is engaged to a pair of securing plate engagement members 170 (see FIGS. 3 and 5).  When the flexible cover securing plate 20 is
engaged it will initially occupy a position with respect to the respective engagement members 170 similar to that shown in phantom in FIG. 3.  The distal end 32 of the flexible cover securing plate 20 is then pushed downward and the peak or crest 26 of
the proximate end 20 will then pivot against the pivot point 176 of the respective engagement member 170 such that the foot 30 of the flexible cover securing plate 20 will push the pawl element 200 of the latch member 190 downward and out of its path, so
that the flexible cover securing plate 20 can become fully engaged within the respective engagement members 170 and the foot 30 becomes fully engaged within the inclined portion 178 (see FIG. 5) of the engagement member 170, as shown in FIG. 3.  In this
position, the flexible cover securing plate 20 is in a closed or a fixed stretching position, where the flexible cover securing plate 20 preferably exerts a tensile force upon the flexible cover 10 so that the flexible cover 10 will stretch and remain
taught over the cargo box 11.
 When the flexible cover securing plate 20 is in the fixed stretching position, locking members 60 can be pushed into a closed or locking position to prevent the flexible cover securing plate 20 from being disengaged from the respective
engagement members 170.  The locking members 60 slide, when pushed, within a second channel 38 in the flexible cover securing plate 20.  Because locking members 60 are designed to create friction when moved within the second channel 38, it takes some
force to move the locking members 60 into a locking position like that shown in phantom in FIG. 8.  This requirement for force to slide the locking members is designed to prevent the locking members from accidentally sliding into such a position when
they are meant to be disengaged, and from sliding into an unlocked or disengaged position similar to that shown in FIG. 8 when they are meant to be in the fully engaged or locked position shown in phantom in FIG. 8.
 When the flexible cover securing plate 20 is in the closed or fixed stretching position shown in FIG. 3, and it is desirable to open the tonneau cover apparatus 8 to gain access to the cargo box 11, the locking members 60 must be moved to a
position where they are not engaged with the inwardly extending flange 118 of the support structure 104.  The latch member 190 must then be depressed to a position consistent with that shown in phantom in FIG. 3 so that the pawl element 200 is disengaged
from the foot 30 of the flexible cover securing plate 20 so that the foot can pivot out of the cavity proximate the inclined portion 178 of the engagement member 170 without being impeded by the pawl element 200.  This can be accomplished either by
pushing downward on the release member 196 or pulling downward on the grip element 236 with enough force to bend the latch member 190.  In this way, the flexible cover securing plate 20 is freed to pivot out of the fully engaged relationship with the
respective engagement members 170 and release the tension on the flexible cover and even roll the flexible cover up around the flexible cover securing plate in a manner similar to that described in the previously described and incorporated Schmeichel
patents.
 As depicted in FIG. 2, the flexible cover securing plate 20 is disengaged from a pawl element 200 on a latching member 190 and a locking member 60 is disengaged from an inward extending flange 118 of a side rail 106 (shown in FIG. 8) prior to
pivoting or rotating the flexible cover securing plate 20 about a securing plate engagement member 170 and out of a fixed stretching position shown in FIG. 1.  Although a generally rectangularly shaped flexible cover securing plate 20 is depicted in the
drawings, it is understood that the flexible cover securing plate 20 may have other configurations without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.  Moreover, it is understood that only selected portions of the flexible cover securing plate
20 are necessary to normal operation and that unnecessary portions may be omitted, if desired.  In preferred embodiments the flexible cover securing plate is made of an aluminum alloy material.  Referring now also to FIG. 7, the flexible cover securing
plate 20 has an underside 56, a base portion 24, an upper surface 33 and a trailing surface 34.
 FIGS. 2, 3, 5 and 8-10 also illustrate attachment of the flexible cover 10 to the support frame 104.  As depicted, the support frame 104 preferably includes side rails 106 having a vertical attachment portion 108 including a sidewall contacting
surface 110, an inwardly extending portion 114, and an inclined portion 116 onto which one half of a two part, hook and loop type fastener 124 has been attached.  The flexible cover 10 has been provided with the other half of the two part, hook and loop
type fastener 124 to enable the sides of the flexible cover 10 to be removably attached to the inclined portion 116 of the side rail 106.  One method by which an end of the flexible cover 10 is attached to a portion of the flexible cover securing plate
20 shown in FIG. 2 is described in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,076,338 and 5,174,353, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.  Note that in the embodiment shown in FIG. 2 the strap 86 is attached to a locking member 60 rather than a portion of
the flexible cover securing plate itself.  It will be appreciated that this strap might be just as effective if it were attached directly to the flexible cover securing plate (not shown) in other embodiments and that it need not be attached to the
locking members 60.  As shown in FIG. 12, which discloses an alternate embodiment, the flexible cover material can be secured in such a way that additional material creates a flap 123 which covers the top of the tailgate 16 and provides a further seal or
covering to limit the passage of dust and moisture into the cargo box 11.
 FIGS. 3 and 10 illustrate the apparatus as it pivots or rotates position into and out of a fixed stretching position and when in the fixed stretching position.  As best seen in phantom lines, flexible cover securing plate 20 includes a distal
end 32, which terminates in a first channel 36, which receives an end of the flexible cover 10.  The flexible cover securing plate 20 also includes a second channel 38, which is sized to slidingly receive a locking member 60.  The second channel 38 is
generally T-shaped and includes opposing sidewalls 40, 42 an upper wall 44 and opposing flanges 46, 48.  The flexible cover securing plate or stretcher bar 20 also includes cavities 52, 54, which are sized to receive plugs 94, 96 that extend from a plate
cap 90.  The plugs 94, 96 are provided with ribs 98, 100 which allow the plate cap 90 to be frictionally attached to the flexible cover securing plate 20.  When the flexible cover securing plate 20 is rotated or pivoted into a fixed stretching position,
a peak or crest 26 of the flexible cover securing plate 20 contacts a pivot point 176 of a securing plate engagement member, or strike 170.  A ridge 28 on the base portion 24 of the flexible cover securing plate 20 then sweeps across an upper surface 177
of an extension portion 174 of the securing plate engagement member 170.  Referring now also to FIGS. 4-5 and 8-9, the ridge 28 then contacts and deflects the pawl element 200 of the engagement portion 194 of a latching member 190.  That is to say, the
latching member 190 is deflected from a first position where the flexible cover securing plate is prevented from being disengaged from the fixed stretching position to a second position, which permits the apparatus to be disengaged from the fixed
stretching position.  After the ridge 28 passes the pawl element 200, two things occur.  First, the base portion 24 is moved into a base portion receiving area 180 in the securing plate engagement member 170, and second, the latching member 190 moves
from the second position to the first position wherein the pawl element 200 of the latching member 190 is biased into a pawl receiving area 50 of the flexible cover securing plate 20 where it confronts the foot 30 on the flexible cover securing plate 20. The pawl element 200 may be disengaged from the foot 30 and withdrawn from the pawl receiving area 50 by placing downward pressure on the release member 196 or pulling downward on the grip element 236, which is engaged with the latching member 190
through an opening 234.
 Turning more specifically to FIG. 4, the latching member 190 has a body portion 192, an engagement portion 194, a release member 196 and an attachment portion 198.  The engagement portion 194 includes a pawl element 200 having a ridge engagement
surface 202 and a foot engagement surface 204.  Adjacent the foot engagement surface 204 is a recess or relief 206 which accommodates a fastening element 186 used to attach the securing plate engagement member or strike 170 to the support frame 104 (see
FIG. 3).  Note that the angle ""A"" between the foot engagement surface 204 and a top surface 207 of the recess 206 of the body portion 192 is less than or equal to 90 degrees, preferably about 88 degrees to prevent the flexible cover securing plate 20
from being forced out of the fixed stretching position when lifting force is applied upwardly upon the bottom of flexible cover securing plate 20 when it is in the fixed stretching position as shown in FIG. 3.  The upper surface 212 of the latch member
190 is generally parallel with the top surface 207 of the recess 206, so the angle ""A"" will be the same as an angle (not shown) between the foot engagement surface 204 and the upper surface 212 of the latch member 190.  The latching member 190 includes a
release member 196, which is preferably an upright member 208 with an enlarged head 210.  In operation, the release member 196 is manipulated by placing downward pressure on the enlarged head 210 of the release member 196 through the flexible cover 10
and is used to disengage the pawl element 200 from the foot 30 of the flexible cover securing plate 20.  Referring now also to FIG. 9, an upwardly extending recess 214, having a throat portion 216, partially delineates or separates the attachment portion
198 from the body portion 192.  The attachment portion 198 is connected to the body portion 192 by a thinned portion 218.  The attachment portion 198 includes a slot 226, which receives a fastener 220 and a threaded aperture 228, which receives an
adjustment member or element 230.  The attachment portion 198 also includes a limiter or stop 232, which controls the range of motion of the latching member 190 as it moves from the first position to the second position.  Note that the upper and lower
surfaces 198a, 198b of the attachment portion 198, that are parallel to broken line 198c (shown schematically in FIG. 4), reside at an angle, B, with respect to upper and lower surfaces 192a, 192b of the body portion 192, respectively, when the latch
member 190 is disengaged from the side rail 106.  This angle ""B"" is about 1 to about 7, preferably about 4 degrees and ensures that the upper surface 212 of the latching member 190 biasingly contacts an inwardly extending flange 118 on a side rail 106
when the latching member 190 is attached thereto as shown in FIGS. 3 and 5.  The latching member 190 is preferably manufactured from a glass filled nylon resin material.
 FIG. 5 illustrates the juxtaposition between a side rail 106 a securing plate engagement member or strike 170 and a latching member 190.  As can be seen, the side rail 106 includes an inclined portion 116 and an inwardly extending flange 118
with an upper surface 120.  The securing plate engagement member 170 generally includes a body portion 172 and an extension portion 174.  More specifically, the body portion 172 includes a pivot point 176, an inclined portion 178 and a plate base portion
receiving area 180.  The extension portion 174 is somewhat tapered and includes an upper surface 177 and an aperture 188.  Referring now also to FIG. 3, the securing plate engagement member 170 has a lower surface 184 common to the body portion 172 and
the extension portion 174.  Also referring to FIG. 3, the body portion 172 of the securing plate engagement member 170 includes an integrally attached fastening element 186, a portion of which extends beyond the body portion 172 and through an aperture
126 in the flange 118 and which is secured by an appropriately sized nut 127.  Like the aforementioned latching element 190, the securing plate engagement member 170 is formed so that the lower surface 184 is slightly concave.  This allows the extension
portion 174 to biasingly contact the upper surface 120 of the flange 118 when the securing plate engagement member 170 is attached thereto.  As with the aforementioned latching member, the securing plate engagement member 170 is preferably manufactured
from a glass filled nylon resin material.
 The bolt or fastening element 186 preferably has an axis ""b"" which passes through the center of the bolt 186.  This axis ""b"" is preferably located a distance, ""d.sub.1"", from the pivot point 176, denoted by line ""a"" in FIG. 3, which is 3/4ths of
an inch in the most preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 3.  In alternative embodiments, however, this distance, ""d.sub.1"", will be equal to or less than 2.0 inches, more preferably 1.5 inches, even more preferably 1.0 inch.  In a more preferred
embodiment, this distance will be about 13/16ths of an inch.
 FIG. 6 illustrates a locking member 60 in isolation prior to use.  The locking member 60 generally comprises an upper portion 62, a lower portion 64 and a web 66 therebetween.  In particular, the upper portion 62 includes a top surface 72 onto
which a friction-imparting element 74 has been affixed.  The term friction-imparting element in the context of this invention is understood to mean a material, which is capable of causing friction between the locking member 60 and the flexible cover
securing plate 20 when the locking member is moved within the flexible cover securing plate.  The preferred friction imparting element 74 in this instance is a loop portion of a hook and loop type fastening element.  The upper portion 62 also includes
opposing side surfaces 76, 78 and corresponding opposite guide strips 80, 82.  The term guide strip in the context of this invention is understood to mean a structure, which is preferably relatively rigid in comparison to the friction-imparting element,
although it need not be so.  The preferred guide strip in this instance is composed of the same material as the locking member.  As illustrated, the upper portion 62 has the same general cross-sectional T-shape as the channel 38 into which it is
inserted.  While a T-shape is illustrated, it is understood that the channel 38 and upper portion 62 may be formed in other complimentary configurations without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.  When locking member 60 is first placed
into the channel 38, the guide strips 80, 82 are generally shaved off a bit to fit the channel.  Once the resulting shavings 83 fall away, the locking member 60 will be friction fit in the channel 38.  This is important so that the locking member will
not inadvertently slide closed when it is intended to be open or slide open when it is intended to be closed.  Turning to the lower portion 64, one end of the lower portion includes a finger 68, which extends beyond the body of the lower portion 64.  The
finger portion 68 includes an engagement surface 70, which is configured to slidingly engage the flange 118 of a side rail 106 (see FIG. 8).  The lower portion 64 is also provided with a slot 84 through which a strap 86 may be threaded, the strap 86
serving to position and align the base portion 24 of the flexible cover securing plate 20 adjacent the securing plate engagement member or strike 170 prior to pivoting the flexible cover securing plate into the fixed stretching position shown in FIGS. 1
and 3.
 FIG. 7 illustrates a locking member 60 as it is being installed into a channel 38 of flexible cover securing plate 20.  As the locking member 60 is inserted into the channel 38, the friction-imparting element 74 is compressed and comes into
sliding contact with the upper surface 44 of the channel 38 (see FIG. 3).  At the same time, the guide strips 80, 82 are engaged by sidewalls 40, 42 of channel 38 (see also FIG. 3).  The sidewalls 40, 42, being constructed of relatively harder material,
modify the opposite guide strips as the locking member is inserted into the channel 38.  As depicted a portion 83 of the opposite guide strips are planed away or shaved during assembly.  Thus, the width of the upper portion 62 and attendant guide strips
80, 82 is then sized to friction fit within the width of the channel 38.  In especially cold weather, the resin material of the preferred locking member 60 and the aluminum alloy of the preferred flexible cover securing plate both contract, but the
locking member 60 will contract somewhat more than the flexible cover securing plate 20.  In especially hot weather, both the preferred locking member 60, made of resin material, and the preferred flexible cover securing plate 20, made of aluminum alloy,
will expand, but it is believed that the expansion of the aluminum alloy will be greater.  In each case, therefore, in both especially cold temperatures and in especially hot temperatures, the preferred locking member 60 and the preferred flexible cover
securing plate 20 will contract or expand at different rates and this will cause some looseness of the sliding locking member 60 within the flexible cover securing plate 20.  The use of the friction-imparting element 74 is intended to compensate for this
variation and to prevent the locking member 60 from sliding into a locked position when it has been placed, and is intended to remain in, an open position.
 In the preferred embodiment, the friction imparting element 74 and the guide strips 80, 82, are all in sliding contact with the walls 40, 42, 44, respectively, while the remaining surfaces of the upper portion 66 are in sliding contact with
flanges 46, 48 of the second channel 38.  These sliding contacts combine to provide a relatively constant resistive force over a wide range of temperatures as the locking element is manipulated along the channel.  While the preferred embodiment features
one friction imparting element and a plurality of guide strips elements, it is understood that other combinations may be used.  As with the aforementioned latching member and securing plate engagement member, the locking member 60 is preferably
manufactured from a glass filled nylon resin material.  As with the aforementioned latching member and securing plate engagement member, the locking member 60 is preferably manufactured from a glass filled nylon resin material.
 FIG. 8 illustrates a portion of the apparatus attached to an inner sidewall 14 of the pickup truck.  More specifically, a side rail 106 of the support frame is attached to the inner sidewall 14 preferably by a plurality of clamps 130.  The clamp
130 has a first arm 132 and a second arm 150.  As illustrated, the first arm 132 and the second arm 150 engage each other at contact surfaces 139 and 157, respectively.  The contact surfaces 139 and 157 serve several different functions.  First, the
contact surfaces 139 and 157 provide a point about which the arms 132 and 150 may pivot with respect to each other.  And second, the contact surfaces 139 and 157 serve to align and guide the arms 132 and 150 so that they are brought into confronting
relation with each other when the clamp 130 is tightened.  The first arm 132 includes a proximal end 134, a transition portion 136 and a distal end 138.  The proximal end 134 includes the contact surface 139 having a recess 140, which is configured to
receive and rotatingly support a pivot or projection 158 on the second arm 150.  The preferred configuration of the recess 140 is generally oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal axis of the arm 132.  The proximal end 134 also includes a transversely
aligned cavity 144, which is coaxially aligned with an aperture 166 in a nut 167.  The cavity 144 is sized to securely retain the nut 167 of a fastening element 169, which includes nut 167 and bolt 164.  The cavity 144 is sized to loosely receive the
shaft of a bolt 164 of the fastening element 169.  Although the aperture 166 is sized to fit the bolt 164, the cavity is much larger which allows the clamp to fall open easily at the end nearest the distal end 138 and distal non-parallel side joint
between two surfaces similar to that shown in FIG. 8.  The distal end 138 of the first arm 132 includes a sidewall-contacting portion 146, which is preferably provided with a grip element 148.  The grip element 148 has an irregular shaped surface and may
be suitably affixed to the sidewall-contacting portion 146.  The preferred grip element 148 has an irregular surface similar to course sandpaper and the preferred method of affixing is by using an adhesive.  The second arm 150 includes a proximal end
152, a transition portion 154 and a distal end 156.  As mentioned above, the proximal end includes a contact surface 157 having a pivot or projection 158, which is configured to be rotatingly supported within a recess 140 in the proximal end 134 of the
first arm 132.  As with the recess 140, the preferred configuration of the projection is generally oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal axis of the arm 150.  The proximal end 152 of the second arm also includes a transversely aligned cavity 145,
which is sized to loosely receive the shaft of a bolt 164 of the fastening element 169.  The distal end 156 includes a side rail-contacting portion 162.  As depicted, the side rail contacting portion 162 is configured to mesh with a similarly configured
surface on a vertical attachment portion 108 of a side rail 106.  Since the oversized cavities 144,145 of the respective first and second arms 132, 150 allow the respective arms to pivot within the joint created by the insertion of the pivot 158 into the
pivot receiving recess 140, the respective side rail and sidewall contact portions 146, 162, respectively, can pass through a range of non-parallel orientations with respect to one another especially enabling the clamp 130 to forcibly hold together a
pair of relatively flat objects whose opposite surfaces when joined together present non parallel surfaces.
 In operation, to secure a side rail 106 to an inner wall 14 of a truck, a side rail 106 is brought into contact with an inner sidewall 14 of a truck 6.  A clamp 130 is then positioned so that it straddles the inner sidewall 14 and the side rail
106.  With the recess 140 and the projection 158 of the respective contact surfaces 139 and 157 in communication with each other, the fastening element is then snugged up so that the distal ends 138 and 156 contact the sidewall 14 and side rail 106,
respectively.  The fastening element is then manipulated to gradually increase the clamping force.  As the force is increased several things occur.  First, the arms 132 and 150 are aligned and guided by the cooperative interaction of the contact surfaces
139 and 157.  Second, limiter surfaces 142 and 160 on the first and second arms 132, 150, respectively, converge towards each other, and third, the arms 132, 150 flex slightly, at the transition portions 136, 154, respectively, where they have some give
due to the materials used to make them and the design of respective first and second arms 132, 150 which include the narrower transition portions 136, 154, respectively.  When the limiter surfaces 142 and 160 contact each other, attachment of the side
rail 106 to an inner sidewall 14 is essentially completed.  This is because the clamp may not be easily over tightened.  With this preferred embodiment, not only is the possibility of overtightening substantially reduced, but the clamp 130 provides a
relatively constant clamping force, which compensates for differences in thickness of the material to be clamped together and also differences in attachment points.
 FIG. 8 also illustrates the operation of the locking member 60 as it may be manipulated between a first position (shown in phantom lines) where it operatively connects flexible cover securing plate 20 to a side rail 106 of a support frame 104
and a second position where the locking member 60 is disengaged from the side rail 106 of the support frame 104.  Note in the first position, that engagement surface 70 of the finger portion 68 engages the lower surface 122 of the side rail flange 118.
 FIG. 9 illustrates in broken line a position of the latching member 190 at the point where either the release member 196 has been manipulated by placing a downward force upon it, or by pulling downward on the body portion 192 or the chord 236
secured to the far end of body portion 192 and the pawl element 200 (see FIG. 4) has been disengaged from the pawl element receiving area 50 of the flexible cover securing plate 20 (see FIG. 3).  That is, the latching member 190 has been moved to the
second position.  Note that the throat portion 216 has been effectively closed and the body portion 192 is in contact with the limiter 232.  As the release member 196 is manipulated, it is contained within or encircled by an appropriately over-sized
opening 128 in the inwardly extending flange 118 of a side rail 106.  The latching member 190 is attached to the flange 118 by a fastening element 219, such as a bolt 220 and attendant washer 222 and nut 224.  The bolt 220 is inserted through an
appropriately sized aperture 126 and through the latching member 190, after which it is secured with a washer 222 and nut 224.  The latching member 190 may be adjusted relative to the flange 118 and bolt 220 by the provision of a somewhat oversized slot
226, which slidingly admits the shaft of a bolt 220 of the fastening element 219.  Positioning of the shaft of the bolt 220 within the slot 226 may be achieved by manipulating an adjustment bolt 230, which is threadably received in a threaded aperture
228 within the attachment portion 198 of the latch member 190.
 Referring now specifically to FIG. 10, a flexible cover securing plate 20 is shown in the fixed stretching position in which the pawl element 200 (see FIGS. 3 and 5) of the latching member 190 projects through the flange 118 of a side rail 106
and into the pawl receiving area 50 of the flexible cover securing plate 20.  The locking member 60 has been manipulated or moved to the second position so that it lies inboard of the flange 118.  In this position, the finger 68 does not operatively
connect the flexible cover securing plate 20 to the support frame.  Note that the strap 86 has one end, which is attached to the locking member 60, and another end which is attached to a mid bar or bow 250.  Such an arrangement serves to guide the
peak/crest 26 of the flexible cover securing plate 20 into operative contact with the pivot point 176 of the securing plate engagement member 170 prior to rotating the flexible cover securing plate 20 into the fixed stretching position.
 Referring now also to FIGS. 11 and 12, a further embodiment of the tonneau cover apparatus 408 is depicted.  A flexible cover 410 is shown attached to a flexible cover securing plate 420 having a side panel 430.  This embodiment differs from the
preferred embodiment in that the flexible cover securing plate 420 is provided with generally radially shaped base portion 422 and the securing plate engagement member 440 is provided with a reciprocally shaped base portion receiving area 442 so that the
base portion 422 can slidably pivot within the base portion receiving area 442 when fully engaged therewith as shown in FIG. 11, such that the flexible cover securing plate 420 can be lifted away from the fixed stretching position, shown in FIG. 12, and
the base portion 422 has pivoted within the receiving area 442, slightly away from the fixed stretching position.  As shown in phantom in FIG. 12, when the base portion 422 is pivoted further, it will come away from the base portion receiving area 442,
but not before it has slidingly pivoted somewhat within the receiving area 442.
 In this embodiment, the reciprocating radial base portion 422 and base portion receiving area 442 of the securing plate engagement member 440 compliment each other so that the base portion 422 can pivot smoothly within the engagement member 440
through a limited but significant radius.  When the base portion 422 has pivoted far enough that a catch point 424 of the flexible cover securing plate 420 engages a pivot point 444 of the engagement member 440, a notch or dip 426 between the catch point
424 and the arcuate surface 428 of the base portion 422 will rotate or slide over the rounded surface 446 of the pivot point 444, enabling the base portion 422 to disengage from the base portion receiving area 442 of the securing plate engagement member
440.
 The alternate embodiment shown in FIGS. 13, 14 and 15 also includes a locking member 560 that engages an inward extending flange 618 of a side rail 606 in a manner similar to that disclosed in the preferred embodiment, except that the locking
member 560 is configured differently and the finger portion 568 is configured somewhat differently.  In addition the locking member 560 is secured within a channel 538 by securing a bolt 539 to the locking member 560 with a nut 541.  The bolt 539 slides
easily within the channel 538 to engage the inwardly extending flange 618 of the side rail 606.  In preferred embodiments, the flexible cover securing plate 520 will have a pair of radial base portions 522 proximate the respective ends of the flexible
cover securing plate 520 which are configured to reciprocally engage a pair of engagement members 670 secured to each of a pair of side rails 606 attached to respective sidewalls (not shown) of the pickup truck 506.  The other features of this alternate
invention are similar to or the equivalent to those features of the preferred embodiment disclosed in FIGS. 1-10.  The further alternate embodiment of the invention includes a tonneau cover apparatus 508 having a support frame 604, which can be secured
to a side wall (not shown) of a pick-up truck (not shown) using a clamp 630 secured at least in part with a bolt 664.  A flexible cover 510 is shown, which is secured to the flexible cover securing plate 520 within a channel 536, shown in FIG. 13.
 The alternate embodiment shown in FIGS. 13, 14 and 15 also includes a locking member 560 that engages an inward extending flange 618 of a side rail 606 in a manner similar to that disclosed in the preferred embodiment, except that the locking
member 560 is configured differently and the finger portion 568 is configured somewhat differently.  In addition the locking member 560 is secured within a channel 538 by securing a bolt 539 to the locking member 560 with a nut 541.  The bolt 539 slides
easily within the channel 538 to engage the inwardly extending flange 618 of the side rail 606.  In preferred embodiments, the flexible cover securing plate 520 will have a pair of radial base portions 522 proximate the respective ends of the flexible
cover securing plate 520 which are configured to reciprocally engage a pair of engagement members 670 secured to each of a pair of side rails 606 attached to respective sidewalls (not shown) of the pickup truck 506.  The other features of this alternate
inventions are similar to or the equivalent to those features of the preferred embodiment disclosed in FIGS. 1-10.
 Referring now also to FIGS. 16 and 17, yet another alternate embodiment of the present invention is disclosed in which the alternate embodiment differs from the preferred embodiment disclosed in FIGS. 1-10, by providing an alternate locking
member 760 which slides easily within a channel 738 similar to the second channel 38 of the preferred embodiment.  The alternate embodiment includes a support frame 804 and a side rail 806 like those associated with the previously disclosed embodiment
shown in FIGS. 1-10.  In the alternate embodiment shown in FIGS. 16 and 17, the locking member 760 does not include the friction imparting elements or guide strips of the preferred embodiment.  Instead, the alternate flexible cover securing plate 720
includes a tension spring 774 secured at each end of the elongated flexible cover securing plate 720 to bias each of two locking members toward a position consistent with a closed or locked position similar to that shown in FIG. 17.  The tension springs
774 are secured to the respective interior surfaces (not shown) of respective end caps 790 at each of the ends 793 of the alternate flexible cover securing plate 720 and to the respective locking members 760, thereby biasing each of the locking members
760 toward a pair of stop bolts 819 secured to the flexible cover securing plate 720 proximate each of the respective ends 793 of the flexible cover securing plate 720.  A draw cord or cable 765 is also attached to each of the respective locking members. Each of the respective draw cords are preferably passed through an eyebolt guide 767 and gathered together in a guide actuator 769.
 During use, the alternate flexible cover securing plate 720 provides a locking or latch mechanism because the chamfered or beveled bottom surface 781 of each of the finger portions 768 of each locking member 760 will be displaced when the
endplate 720 pivots with respect to the engagement members (not shown) into a closed or fixed stretching position from a position in which the flexible cover securing plate 720 is engaged with the respective engagement members (not shown), but has not
pivoted into the position shown in FIG. 17.  In FIG. 16, the locking members 760 are just beginning to be displaced as the flexible cover securing plate 720 pivots down to a closed position shown in FIG. 17.  When the locking members 760 rest against the
stop bolts 819, against which they are biased by the tension spring 774, they will engage the flange 818 if the flexible cover securing plate 720 is in the closed or fixed stretching position.  As the flexible cover securing plate 720 is pivoted with
respect to the engagement members (not shown), the beveled bottom surface 781 will first contact the upper side of the end 821 of the respective inwardly extending flange 818, will be forced away from the stop bolt 819 until the finger portion 768 passes
below the flange 818 and flexible cover securing plate 720 is fully engaged as shown in FIG. 17.  In FIG. 17, the beveled bottom surface 781 is no longer engaged with the upper side of the end 821 of the inwardly extending flange 818, and the spring
biased locking member will engage the flange 818 as shown in FIG. 17.  When the flexible cover securing plate 720 is not engaged as shown in FIG. 17 the spring biased locking member 720 will slide to the same position shown in FIG. 17, because it will
spring biased against the stop bolt 819 which is positioned within the flexible cover securing plate 720 such that the locking member 760 will stop against the stop bolt 819 is the same position it will occupy within the flexible cover securing plate 720
when the locking member 760 is biased up against the end 821 of the flange 818.
 In order to lift the flexible cover securing plate 720 and pivot it out of the fixed stretching position in which it resides in FIG. 17, a user can draw the draw cords or cables 765 by pulling on the pull actuator 769, thereby drawing the
locking members 760 away from each of the respective flanges 818, thereby disengaging the respective finger portions 768 from the respective flanges 818 as shown in phantom in FIG. 17 when the locking members 760 are in this position, the flexible cover
securing plate 720 can be pivoted out of the respective engagement members, and the cover 710 can be rolled up in order to gain better access to the cargo box.
 Yet another alternate embodiment is shown in FIG. 18 where an embodiment like that shown in FIGS. 16 and 17 is shown, but which differs primarily only because the tension springs 774 of the embodiment shown in FIGS. 16 and 17 are replaced by
compression springs 974 which push, rather than pull the locking member 960 or members, if there are more than one, which there preferably are, against the flange 1018 and/or the stop bolt 1019.  In this case, the compression spring 974 slides over and
is engaged by a first spring guide protrusion 977 extending away from the locking member 960 and a second spring guide protrusion 979 extending away from a spring stop 983.  All the other features of this embodiment are preferably the same as the
features of the alternate embodiment shown in FIGS. 16 and 17 and this embodiment operates generally in the same way with the exception of the operation of the compression spring 974 as compared to the tension spring 774.  The embodiment shown in FIG. 18
includes a support frame 1004 having a side rail 1006.  The flexible cover securing plate 920 is shown in an engaged position.  The flexible cover 910 is engaged with the support frame 1004 and the finger 968 of the locking member 960, configured to
slidingly engage an outwardly extending flange 1018 of the support frame 1004, is shown in an engage position, similar to that shown in FIG. 17 with respect to the prior embodiment, wherein the finger 968 can be slidingly positioned under an end 1021 of
the outwardly extending flange 1018, as shown.
 It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present invention have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the invention, the
disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the
appended claims are expressed.

A seal for retaining liquid between two relatively rotatable members of which one member carries the seal and the other member has a cylindrical surface engaged by the seal,
comprising a sealing ring having a static sealing portion carried by said one member and spaced from the said surface of the said other member, a flexible flange extending from the static sealing portion, generally in the direction in which the said
surface of said other member extends and towards the liquid to be sealed, to an outer end portion of the sealing ring, two mutually-inclined surfaces on said outer end portion defining a circular sealing lip, and a plurality of circumferentiallyspaced
projections raised on that inclined surface which is the closer of the two inclined surfaces to the static sealing portion and which is remote from the liquid, each projection having a surface which is generated by movement, about the central axis of the
ring, of a line which, when the seal is carried by the first said member and is in its free state prior to assembly of the said other member, is substantially parallel to the operative direction of the said surface of said other member and which, at one
position, is contiguous with the sealing lip and which, on opposite sides of said one position, recedes from the sealing lip in a direction toward said static sealing portion so that when said seal is in said free state said surface of said projection
lies entirely at the same radial distance as the sealing lip or on the same side of said sealing lip as said static sealing portion, said surface of said projection having a substantial width at said one position, the sealing lip and the portion of the
said surface of each projection which is contiguous with the sealing lip engaging the said surface of the said other member with an interference fit, whereby upon assembly of the sealing ring between said members, the flange is deflected from its free
state, about the static sealing portion, the part of the surface of each projection in the vicinity of that part which is contiguous with the lip consequently engaging the said surface of the said other member over an area having opposite sides which
extend away from the sealing lip and which diverge away from each other and with a pressure which increases as the distance from the sealing lip in a direction at right angles to the plane of the sealing lip increases.
2.  A seal according to claim 1, wherein the said surface of each projection at the side of said one position not only recedes from the sealing lip but merges circumferentially into the corresponding surface of the adjacent projection.
3.  A seal according to claim 1, wherein the said surface of each projection is convex in a direction radially inwardly of said sealing lip adjacent and on both sides of one position.
4.  A seal as claimed in claim 1, in which said sealing lip is on the radially innermost part of the seal.
5.  A seal as claimed in claim 1, in which said sealing lip is on the radially outermost part of the seal.  ",,"This invention relates to a seal for use between two relatively-rotating
surfaces, for preventing the leakage of fluid therebetween.  One such seal is a rotary shaft seal.
It is well known to provide helical grooves or threads adjacent the sealing lip of a rotary shaft seal in order to provide sealing of fluid under dynamic conditions.  These have been found to operate reasonably well when the direction of rotation
is in one direction only, but have the serious disadvantage of providing a leakage path for the fluid when the direction of rotation is reversed.
It is an object of this invention to provide a seal for use between two relatively-rotating surfaces which not only has a more effective sealing function but also has such sealing function irrespective of the direction of relative rotation.
The invention provides a lip seal for fluids, for use between two relatively-rotatable surfaces, having a surface-engageable sealing lip portion and projections spaced at intervals around the sealing lip portion on the side thereof intended, in
use, to be remote from the fluid to be sealed, each projection being adapted to engage the surface engageable by the sealing lip portion with a contact area of which two opposite sides extend away from the lip portion and diverge away from each other so
that each side is inclined at an acute angle to the part of the sealing lip portion adjacent thereto.  When assembled between two relatively-rotating parts, the force under the projection increases as the axial distance from the sealing lip portion
increases. In the accompanying drawings
FIG. 1 is a view, partly in section, of a rotary shaft seal, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, mounted in sealing relationship with the shaft of an automobile gear box.
FIG. 2 is a perspective view of part of the rotary shaft seal shown in FIG. 1,
FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 show the cross section of the sealing ring in radial planes containing the lines 3--3, 4--4 and 5--5 respectively, of FIG. 2,
FIG. 6 is a developed view of the contact area of the seal with the shaft,
FIG. 7 is a sectional view of part of another rotary shaft seal in accordance with an embodiment of the invention,
FIG. 8 is a sectional view of part of an axial face seal, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, and
FIG. 9 is a sectional view of part of another axial face seal, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to FIGS. 1 to 5 of the drawings, the rotary shaft seal 1 is mounted in a housing 2 formed at one end of a gear box
casing 3.  A shaft 4 projects from the gear box casing and has a suitable means 5 for connecting it to a device to be driven by the shaft.  The shaft 4 is supported in the gear box casing by a bearing 6.  The seal 1 seals the space between the shaft and
that wall of the housing which is parallel to the axis of the shaft, so as to prevent leakage of liquid from the gear box to the exterior thereof.
Referring more particularly to FIGS. 2 to 5, the seal 1, which is described merely to show one example of a seal in accordance with the invention is of generally annular construction, is conveniently moulded to shape, and is made from any
suitable sealing material such as rubber or a rubber-like material.  It comprises a static sealing portion formed as an outer holding annulus 7 which is stiffened by an inserted metal ring 8, and an inner flexible flange 9.  A garter spring 10 embraces
the flange 9.
The inner flexible flange 9 has an outer end portion formed with two surfaces 11 and 12 each of which is inclined at an angle to the axis of the seal so as to meet the other and define a sealing lip 13.
As can be seen in FIG. 1, the surface 11 lies in use, adjacent to the liquid to be sealed.  The surface 11 is, therefore, on the ""oil"" side of the seal and the surface 12 is, therefore, on the ""air"" side of the seal.
Surface 12 has thereon and spaced therearound a plurality of projecting parts which join together to form an integral projection 14 with an undulating side wall 15.  This side wall 15 is substantially parallel to the axis of the seal in its free
state as moulded and the distance of this side wall 15 from the axis of the seal varies cyclically around the surface 12 having its minimum distance equal to the radius of the lip 13.  As seen in FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 the axial length of the side wall 15
varies from a maximum at the lip 13 to a minimum (which may be zero) at its points most remote from the lip 13.
When the seal is fitted in a housing and engages with a shaft, as shown in FIG. 1, the engagement with the shaft will be an interference fit.  The contact area of the sealing lip portion 13 with the shaft will be thin and continuous, and the
contact area of the projection 14 with the shaft will be a number of spaced-apart contact areas 15' (see FIG. 6).  Each such contact area 15' has two opposite sides 15"" which extend away from the lip portion and diverge away from each other.  Thus each
of the opposite sides 15"" is inclined at an acute angle to the part of the sealing lip portion which is adjacent thereto.  Under static conditions, the force under the projection on the shaft increases as the distance from the sealing lip portion, at
right angles thereto, increases, substantially up to the outer edge of the contact area.
In operation, any fluid which leaks past the lip to the air side thereof will be carried around by the rotating shaft.  When it approaches one side 15"" of the contact area of the projection, the liquid by reason of the shape of the contact area,
will be moved towards the seal lip, building up as a wedge-shaped pocket of liquid.  Due to the rotation of the shaft, pressure will be developed in the wedge-shaped pocket of liquid.  This pressure will overcome the contact pressure between the lip 13
and the part of the projection adjacent the lip 13 on the one hand, and the shaft 4 on the other hand.  However, the force under the projection increases as the axial distance from the lip 13 increases and thus the leakage liquid will undergo a dynamic
pumping action and will tend to be forced back under the lip to the oil side thereof.  The formation of the wedge-shaped pocket is aided by the side wall 15 which converges towards the surface of the shaft in the region of the side of the contact area. 
Any residual film of liquid not forced back under the lip 13, will be carried round by the shaft to the next wedge-shaped pocket.
This dynamic pumping effect will be obtained irrespective of the direction of rotation of a shaft because of the two opposite diverging sides 15"" of the surface contact area 15' of the projection with a shaft.  Furthermore, efficient sealing will
be provided even when the shaft is stationary because the engagement of the sealing lip portion with the shaft is continous.
In use of the shaft seal just described with reference to the drawings, there will be a continuous circulation of liquid under the sealing lip portion and under a substantial part of each projection in contact with the shaft.  This circulation of
liquid will not only tend to act as a lubricant and prevent undue wear of the sealing lip portion and a part of the projection, but will also tend to act to cool the sealing lip portion and the projection.
The seal shown in FIGS. 1 to 6 has a lip which engages a rotating surface during operation, and the sealing lip is located internally of the seal.  FIG. 7 shows a seal which rotates with a shaft 16 during operation.
The seal comprises an inner holding annulus 17 which is stiffened by an inserted metal ring 18 and an outer flexible flange 19.  An endless spring 20 under compression is associated with the flange 19.  The outer flexible flange 19 has two
surfaces 21 and 22, each of which are inclined at an angle to the axis of the seal so as to meet and define a sealing lip 23.
The surface 22 has thereon an integral projection 24, with a side wall 25, which is similar to the projection 14 shown in FIGS. 2 to 5, except that the distance of the side wall 25 from the axis of the seal is at a maximum at the lip 23.
The sealing lip 23 and the projection 14 are circumferentially compressed upon assembly within the stationary housing surface 26.
The operation of the seal is the same as that described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 6.
In FIG. 8 there is shown an axial face seal in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
This axial face seal 27 of FIG. 8 has a holding annulus 28 which fits on a rotatable shaft 29, and a flexible flange 30.  The annulus 28 is stiffened by two cup-shaped washer-like pressings 31, 32 between which is held a spring member 33.  The
cup-shaped pressing 31 is an interference fit on the annulus 28 and the cup-shaped pressing 32 is an interferencee fit on the spring member 33.  The spring member 33 urges the flange 30 against a static surface 34 of a housing.
The outer end portion of the flexible flange 30 has two surfaces 35 and 36 which are inclined at an angle to each other and meet to form a sealing lip 37.  The surface 36 has an integral projection 38 which is similar to the projections 14 and 24
of the two previously-described embodiments.  Thus, when the sealing ring is in its free state as moulded, the generating surface of each projection is substantially parallel to the static surface 34 and transverse to the central axis of the shaft.
FIG. 9 shows an axial face seal in accordance with another embodiment of the invention.  This axial face seal 39 has a holding annulus 40 which fits on the surface 41 of a stationary housing 42.  The annulus 40 is stiffened by two cup-shaped
washer-like pressings 43, 44, between which is held a spring member 45.  The cup-shaped pressing 43 is an interference fit on the surface 41 and the cup-shaped pressing 44 is an interference fit on the spring member 45.  The spring-member 45 urges the
flange 46 against a surface of a rotatable member 47.
The outer end portion of the flexible flange 46 has two surfaces 48 and 49 which are inclined at an angle to each other and meet to form a sealing lip 50.  The surface 48 has an integral projection 51 which is similar to the projections 14, 24
and 38 of the three previously-described embodiments and which is arranged to provide a contact area in a manner similar to that previously described.
In the embodiments of the invention described with reference to the drawings, each contact area 15 is formed by simple continuous projection on the inclined surface 12.  Such a continuous projection is not essential.  A number of spaced-apart
discrete projections, each providing one or more contact areas, similar to a contact area 15, could be formed integrally on the inclined surface which in use of the seal is remote from the fluid to be sealed.
Lip seals for fluids in accordance with this invention may readily be designed to give an optimum or required pumping action by suitable choice of the length (in a direction at right angles to the sealing lip portion) of the contact surface of
the projection with a shaft or other member and/or by suitable choice of the wedge angles.
With a lip seal for fluids in accordance with this invention intended for use as a shaft seal a greater degree of lack of concentricity between the shaft axis and the housing axis can be tolerated than heretofor.
A seal in accordance with the invention can be split into two or more parts which abut against each other to form the seal.

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION
Problems to be Solved by the Invention
 The arrangement disclosed in Patent Publication 1 above has the problem that, since it is necessary to provide the U-shaped frame and the V-shaped frame in addition to the existing front frame in the engine compartment, which is in a vehicle
body front part, not only does the vehicle body weight increase, thus increasing fuel consumption, but also the U-shaped frame and the V-shaped frame, which are disposed on a central line of the vehicle body, interfere with mounting of an engine and,
moreover, the engine compartment becomes long in the fore-and-aft direction, thus compressing the space within the vehicle compartment.
 Furthermore, the arrangement disclosed in Patent Publication 2 has the possibility that, since the outrigger is disposed in the vehicle width direction, the outrigger would be easily deformed by a load inputted into the front side frame, and the
load inputted into the front side frame would not be transmitted efficiently to the side sill or the floor frame and absorbed.
 The present invention has been attained in the light of the above-mentioned circumstances, and it is a first object of the present invention to achieve a balance between absorption of a collision load and protection of a vehicle compartment when
a vehicle is involved in a collision, without increasing the vehicle body weight.
 Furthermore, it is a second object of the present invention to efficiently transmit a collision load inputted into a front side frame to a side sill and a center frame and absorb it.

 In order to attain the first object, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is proposed a vehicle body frame structure wherein a protection area of an automobile vehicle body comprises an octagonal frame having a pair of
left and right longitudinal members that extend in the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction, a pair of front and rear lateral members that extend in the vehicle width direction, and four inclined members obliquely coupling end parts of the longitudinal
members and lateral members, and an energy absorption area connected to the protection area and positioned in an end part in vehicle body fore-and-aft direction comprises a U-shaped frame that curves in a U-shape toward the vehicle body fore-and-aft
direction.
 According to a second aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first aspect, the protection area is a vehicle compartment, and the energy absorption area is an engine compartment.
 According to a third aspect of the present invention, in addition to the first aspect, the protection area is a fuel tank housing part, and the energy absorption area is a trunk compartment.
 According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, in addition to any one of the first to third aspects, the U-shaped frame is formed from a front bumper beam and left and right upper members.
 According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, in addition to any one of the first to third aspects, the U-shaped frame is formed from a front bumper beam and left and right front side frames.
 In order to attain the second object, according to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is proposed a vehicle body frame structure comprising front side frames disposed in the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction on opposite left and
right sides of an engine compartment, side sills disposed in the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction on opposite left and right sides of a vehicle compartment, a center frame disposed in the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction in a middle part, in the
vehicle width direction, of the vehicle compartment, and a coupling member that couples the rear end of the front side frame, the front end of the side sill, and the front end of the center frame, characterized in that the coupling member comprises an
outrigger that extends from the rear end of the front side frame obliquely rearward toward the outer side in the vehicle width direction and is connected to the front end of the side sill, and a center frame extension that extends from the rear end of
the front side frame obliquely rearward toward the inner side in the vehicle width direction and is connected to the front end of the center frame.
 According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, in addition to the sixth aspect, a front subframe mounting portion on which the rear end of the front subframe is mounted is provided at the front end of the center frame extension of the
coupling member.
 According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, in addition to the seventh aspect, the outrigger, the center frame extension, and the front subframe mounting portion of the coupling member are formed from one continuous member.
 An engine compartment 11 and a trunk compartment 16 of an embodiment correspond to the energy absorption area of the present invention, a vehicle compartment 13 and a fuel tank housing part 15 of the embodiment correspond to the protection area
of the present invention, a side sill 14 and a rear side frame 17 of the embodiment correspond to the longitudinal member of the present invention, a dashboard lower cross member 22, middle cross member 24, and rear cross member 25 of the embodiment
correspond to the lateral member of the present invention, and an outrigger 30b, gussets 38 and 39, and an enlarged width portion 25a of the embodiment correspond to the inclined member of the present invention.
Effects of the Invention
 In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, since the protection area of the automobile vehicle body includes the octagonal frame having the pair of left and right longitudinal members that extend in the vehicle body
fore-and-aft direction, the pair of front and rear lateral members that extend in the vehicle width direction, and the four inclined members obliquely coupling end parts of the longitudinal members and lateral members, it is possible to ensure that there
is sufficient rigidity both for a collision load from the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction and a collision load from the side of the vehicle body, thereby minimizing deformation of the protection area.  Furthermore, since the energy absorption area
connected to the protection area and positioned in the end part in the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction includes the U-shaped frame that curves in a U-shape toward the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction, it is possible to absorb effectively a
collision load from the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction, including an offset collision, due to the high rigidity U-shaped frame being crushed, thereby preventing more effectively deformation of the protection area.  Moreover, since it is unnecessary
to provide a special reinforcing member, it is possible to achieve a balance between absorption of a collision load and protection of a vehicle compartment without this being accompanied by an increase in weight.
 Furthermore, in accordance with the second aspect of the present invention, since the protection area is the vehicle compartment and the energy absorption area is the engine compartment, it is possible by crushing of the U-shaped frame of the
engine compartment to absorb effectively a collision load inputted from the front of the vehicle body and by the high rigidity octagonal frame to prevent deformation of the vehicle compartment, thus protecting an occupant.
 Moreover, in accordance with the third aspect of the present invention, since the protection area is the fuel tank housing part and the energy absorption area is the trunk compartment, it is possible by crushing of the U-shaped frame of the
trunk compartment to effectively absorb a collision load inputted from the rear of the vehicle body and by the high rigidity octagonal frame to prevent deformation of the fuel tank housing part, thus protecting a fuel tank.
 Furthermore, in accordance with the sixth aspect of the present invention, since the coupling member, which couples the rear end of the front side frame disposed in the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction in the engine compartment, the front end
of the side sill disposed in the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction in the side of the vehicle compartment, and the front end of the center frame disposed in the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction in the middle part of the vehicle compartment, includes
the outrigger, which extends from the rear end of the front side frame obliquely rearward toward the outer side in the vehicle width direction and is connected to the front end of the side sill, and the center frame extension, which extends from the rear
end of the front side frame obliquely rearward toward the inner side in the vehicle width direction and is connected to the front end of the center frame, it is possible to disperse a rearward collision load inputted into the front side frame, when the
vehicle is involved in a collision, between the side sill and the center frame via the outrigger and the center frame extension of the coupling member, thereby minimizing deformation of the vehicle compartment due to the collision load.  In this case,
since the outrigger and the center frame extension of the coupling member are inclined relative to the vehicle width direction, it does not deform itself but transmit the collision load efficiently to the side sill and the center frame.
 Moreover, in accordance with the seventh aspect of the present invention, since the front subframe mounting portion, on which the rear end of the front subframe is mounted, is provided at the front end of the center frame extension of the
coupling member, when a load is inputted from the front into the front subframe when the vehicle is involved in a head-on collision, the reaction acts on the front subframe from the coupling member connected to the side sill and the center frame, thus
enabling the front subframe to be reliably crushed and the collision load to be absorbed.
 Furthermore, in accordance with the eighth aspect of the present invention, since the outrigger, the center frame extension, and the front subframe mounting portion of the coupling member are formed from one continuous member, compared with a
case in which they are formed from separate members not only is it possible to improve the strength and reliably transmit the load, but it is also possible to reduce the number of components, thus cutting the cost. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE

 The rubber bush joint 36 is housed within the front subframe mounting portion 30a of the coupling member 30, and a rear part of the front subframe 31 is supported on a bolt 37 running through the rubber bush joint 36 (see FIG. 4).  The front
part of the front subframe 31 is also supported on the lower face of the front side frame 12 via the rubber bush joint 35 (see FIG. 1), which has the same structure.
 As is clear from referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 5 together, a frame surrounding the vehicle compartment 13, which is a first protection region, is formed in an octagonal shape in plan view.  That is, the left and right side sills 14 and 14
extending in the vehicle body fore-and-aft direction, the dashboard lower cross member 22 and middle cross member 24 extending in the vehicle width direction, the left and right outriggers 30b and 30b obliquely connecting the front ends of the side sills
14 and 14 and opposite left and right ends of the dashboard lower cross member 22, and the left and right gussets 38 and 38 obliquely connecting the rear ends of the side sills 14 and 14 and opposite left and right ends of the middle cross member 24 form
in their entirety an octagonal shape as shown by thick line A in FIG. 5.
 Furthermore, a frame surrounding the fuel tank housing part 15, which is a second protection region, is formed in an octagonal shape in plan view.  That is, the left and right rear side frames 17 and 17 extending in the vehicle body fore-and-aft
direction, the middle cross member 24 and rear cross member 25 extending in the vehicle width direction, the left and right gussets 39 and 39 obliquely connecting the front ends of the rear side frames 17 and 17 and opposite left and right ends of the
middle cross member 24, and enlarged width portions 25a and 25a formed by enlarging obliquely forwardly opposite left and right ends of the rear cross member 25 connected to the rear side frames 17 and 17 form in their entirety an octagonal shape as
shown by thick line B in FIG. 5.
 Furthermore, a frame surrounding the engine compartment 11, which is disposed in front of the vehicle compartment 13 and forms a first energy absorption region, has a substantially U-shaped form in plan view.  That is, since the front bumper
beam 21 curves so as to project on the front side of the vehicle body, the front bumper beam 21 and the front side frames 12 and 12 and upper members 19 and 19 extending from opposite ends, in the vehicle width direction, of the front bumper beam 21
toward the rear of the vehicle body form in their entirety a U-shape as shown by thick line C in FIG. 5.
 Furthermore, a frame surrounding the trunk compartment 16, which is disposed to the rear of the fuel tank housing part 15 and forms a second energy absorption region, has a substantially U-shaped form in plan view.  That is, since the rear end
frame 27 is curved so as to project on the rear side of the vehicle body, the rear end frame 27 and the rear side frames 17 and 17 extending from opposite ends, in the vehicle width direction, of the rear end frame 27 toward the front of the vehicle body
form in their entirety a U-shape as shown by thick line D in FIG. 5.
 The operation of the embodiment of the present invention having the above arrangement is now explained.
 As is clear from FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, since the front bumper beam 21, which curves so as to project on the front side of the vehicle body, and the front side frames 12 and 12 and upper members 19 and 19, which extend from opposite ends, in the
vehicle width direction, of the front bumper beam 21 toward the rear of the vehicle body, form in their entirety a U-shape, they have high rigidity toward a collision load inputted from the front of the vehicle body due to a collision of the vehicle, and
they exhibit a large effect in absorbing an impact when they are crushed, thereby minimizing deformation of the vehicle compartment 13.
 Furthermore, since the side sills 14 and 14, the dashboard lower cross member 22 and middle cross member 24, the left and right outriggers 30b and 30b obliquely connecting the front ends of the side sills 14 and 14 and opposite left and right
ends of the dashboard lower cross member 22, and the left and right gussets 38 and 38 obliquely connecting the rear ends of the side sills 14 and 14 and opposite left and right ends of the middle cross member 24, which surround the vehicle compartment
13, form an octagonal frame, the rigidity increases compared with that of a rectangular frame, thus suppressing more effectively deformation of the vehicle compartment 13.  This is because the shape that has the highest deformation resistance to an
external force is a circle, and an octagon is closer to a circle than is a rectangle.  This octagonal frame structure can minimize deformation of the vehicle compartment 13 not only when there is a head-on collision but also when there is a side
collision in which a load is inputted from the side sills 14 and 14.
 Similarly, since the rear end frame 27, which curves so as to project on the rear side of the vehicle body, and the rear side frames 17 and 17, which extend from opposite ends, in the vehicle width direction, of the rear end frame 27 toward the
front of the vehicle body, form in their entirety a U-shape, they have high rigidity toward a collision load inputted from the rear of the vehicle body due to collision of the vehicle, and they exhibit a large effect in absorbing impact when they are
crushed, thereby minimizing deformation of the fuel tank housing part 15 and preventing the fuel tank from being damaged.
 Furthermore, since the rear side frames 17 and 17, the middle cross member 24 and rear cross member 25 extending in the vehicle width direction, the left and right gussets 39 and 39 obliquely connecting the front ends of the rear side frames 17
and 17 and opposite left and right ends of the middle cross member 24, and the enlarged width portions 25a and 25a formed by enlarging obliquely forwardly opposite left and right ends of the rear cross member 25 connected to the rear side frames 17 and
17, which surround the fuel tank housing part 15, form in their entirety an octagonal shape, the rigidity increases compared with that of a rectangular frame, thus suppressing deformation of the fuel tank housing part 15 more effectively.  This octagonal
frame structure can minimize deformation of the fuel tank housing part 15 not only when there is a rear-end collision but also when there is a side collision in which a load is inputted from the rear side frames 17 and 17.
 When a rearward load acts on the front side frame 12 when there is a vehicle head-on collision, as shown in FIG. 3, the load is transmitted to the side sill 14 and the center frame 29 via the coupling member 30 and dispersed.  In this case,
since the outrigger 30b of the coupling member 30 extends obliquely rearward to the outer side in the vehicle width direction, compared with a case in which it extends straight ahead in the vehicle width direction, the load from the front side frame 12
can be transmitted efficiently to the side sill 14.  Furthermore, since the center frame extension 30c of the coupling member 30 extends obliquely rearward to the inner side in the vehicle width direction, compared with a case in which it extends
straight ahead in the vehicle width direction, the load from the front side frame 12 can be transmitted efficiently to the center frame 29.
 Moreover, since the coupling member 30 is formed from the single member, which includes the front subframe mounting portion 30a, the outrigger 30b, and the center frame extension 30c, compared with a case in which they are formed from separate
members and integrally joined, not only can the number of components be reduced, but the strength of the coupling member 30 also increases.  It is also possible to reinforce a portion of the coupling member 30 where strength is required by superimposing
a blank thereon.
 Furthermore, since the front subframe mounting portion 30a is provided at the front end of the center frame extension 30c of the coupling member 30, when there is a head-on collision a reaction force acts on the front subframe 31 from the
coupling member 30 side, and as shown in FIG. 7 deformation of the vehicle compartment 13 can be suppressed while absorbing collision energy by bending the front subframe 31.
 Moreover, left and right front seats are disposed to the rear of the front subframe 31, and since positions corresponding to the area beneath the legs of occupants seated on these front seats are reinforced by the high rigidity coupling members
30 and 30, it is possible to protect the occupants' legs from the impact of a head-on collision.
 An embodiment of the present invention is explained above, but the present invention may be modified in a variety of ways as long as the modifications do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
 For example, in the embodiment, the frame structure of the present invention is applied to the engine compartment 11 and vehicle compartment 13 on the front side and the trunk compartment and fuel tank housing part 15 on the rear side, but it
may be applied to only one of either the front side or the rear side.
 Furthermore, in the embodiment, the gussets 38 and 39 are formed from a member separate from the middle cross member 24, but they may be formed integrally by increasing the width of opposite ends of the middle cross member 24.
 Moreover, the coupling member 30 of the embodiment includes the front subframe mounting portion 30a, but the front subframe mounting portion 30a is not always required.

 ",,"CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
 The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C.  .sctn.119 to Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-085136 filed Apr.  7, 2011, entitled ""Vehicle Body Lower Structure"".  The contents of this application are incorporated herein by
reference in their entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
 The present embodiment relates to vehicle body lower structures, and in particular, relates to a vehicle body lower structure with improved ability to absorb a collision load caused by a narrow offset collision in which a vehicle collides with a
collision object, e.g., an oncoming vehicle, such that a rigid structure, such as a front side frame, of the oncoming vehicle strikes the front end of a side sill of the body of the vehicle while the oncoming vehicle is deviating to the right or left
side of the front end of the vehicle so as to pass the vehicle at a slight distance therefrom.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 A vehicle body structure has been known which suppresses deformation of the body of a vehicle by distributing a collision load, caused by an offset collision between the vehicle and an oncoming vehicle (collision object), to increase the
strength of the vehicle body (refer to, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2003-237636).
 FIG. 10 is a schematic plan view of the vehicle body in the vehicle disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2003-237636 and illustrates a state where a collision load is applied to the vehicle upon narrow offset
collision.  FIG. 11 is a side elevational view of essential part on the left of the vehicle disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2003-237636 and illustrates a state of a door after narrow offset collision.
 Referring to FIG. 10, in the vehicle structure disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2003-237636, each diagonal member 500 extending from the front end of a side sill 100 rearwardly and inwardly in a direction along
the width of the vehicle (hereinafter, referred to as the ""vehicle width direction"") is disposed so as to connect a corner at which the side sill 100 is coupled to an outer side member 200 to a corner at which a floor frame (central member) 300 is
coupled to the floor cross member 400.
 In this case, the diagonal member 500 prevents the side sill 100 from being inwardly bent under a collision load applied from a front wheel T upon narrow offset collision with a collision object, such as an oncoming vehicle C2.
 In the related-art vehicle body structure, if a narrow offset collision occurs such that a collision object, e.g., the oncoming vehicle C2 strikes against a portion outside a front side frame 600 in the vehicle width direction as illustrated in
FIG. 10, a collision load F will be applied to the front end of the side sill 100.  Even if a load applied to the side sill 100 is reduced by the diagonal member 500, therefore, a large load will be applied to the side sill 100 in a direction in which a
frontal collision load is applied.  Consequently, the side sill 100 is bent and deformed such that it is compressed by a length L100, like a side sill 100A indicated by an alternate long and two short dashes line in FIG. 10.
 In this case, a front pillar 700 coupled to an upper portion of the front end of the side sill 100 is also moved to the rear of the vehicle body in accordance with deformation of the side sill 100 as illustrated in FIG. 11, so that front
attachment portions 710, included in the front pillar 700, for a door 800 are moved rearward.  Unfortunately, the door 800 may become difficult to open.
 In a vehicle equipped with no diagonal members 500 as illustrated in FIG. 10, since the front wheel T enters a vehicle interior while moving rearward, the side sill is bent toward the vehicle interior, like a side sill 100B indicated by another
alternate long and two dashes line in FIG. 10, so that the vehicle interior is deformed.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 It is therefore desirable to receive and absorb a collision load using vehicle body front part anterior to the door so that the side sill is not deformed upon narrow offset collision of the vehicle.  The present embodiment provides a vehicle
body lower structure that prevents a front pillar from moving to the rear of a vehicle body upon narrow offset collision in order to prevent a door from being difficult to open.
 According to an aspect of the present embodiment, a vehicle body lower structure includes a side sill disposed on an end of a vehicle body in a vehicle width direction so as to extend along the length of the vehicle body, the side sill including
a crush area and a bulkhead, the crush area being crushable under a collision load caused by collision with a vehicle in order to absorb the collision load, the bulkhead being disposed on the rear of the crush area inside the side sill, and a reinforcing
frame attached to a side surface of the side sill facing a vehicle interior, one end of the reinforcing frame being joined to surface part of a portion, where the bulkhead is disposed, of the side sill closer to the vehicle interior such that the
reinforcing frame extends rearwardly and inwardly in the vehicle width direction, the other end thereof being joined to a floor frame.
 In the vehicle body lower structure with the above configuration, when a narrow offset collision between the vehicle and a collision object occurs, the side sill is pressed by, for example, a wheel which is positioned in front of the side sill
and is moved rearward under a collision load, and the crush area, which is positioned on the front of a junction between the side sill and the reinforcing frame and which has a low strength, is crushed, thus absorbing the collision load.  In the side
sill, since the bulkhead increases the cross-sectional stiffness of the rear end of the crush area to prevent the cross-sectional shape of the side sill from being broken (or crushed), the collision load applied to the front end of the side sill can be
concentrated on the crush area such that the crush area is more easily crushed, thus increasing the ability to absorb the collision load.  Consequently, if a narrow offset collision between the vehicle and a collision object occurs, crushing the crush
area in the front end of the side sill will be locally facilitated, thus providing good ability to absorb a collision load.
 Furthermore, since the surface part of the portion, where the bulkhead is disposed, of the side sill closer to the vehicle interior is supported by the reinforcing frame joined to the inner side of the side sill in the vehicle width direction
such that the side sill is prevented from being deformed inwardly to the vehicle interior, the side sill is not bent inwardly to the vehicle interior.  This prevents a front pillar from being moved rearward and also prevents the shape of a door opening
and that of the vehicle interior from being deformed.
 As a result, since the crush area absorbs a collision load caused by collision of the vehicle, part of the side sill on the rear of the crush area is prevented from being bent, thus preventing a door from being difficult to open due to
deformation of the door opening above the side sill.  The door can be opened and closed after collision while the shape of the door opening is being kept.
 Since one end of the reinforcing frame is connected to the side sill and the other end thereof is joined to the floor frame such that the reinforcing frame extends between the side sill and the floor frame, the reinforcing frame securely
supports a floor surface in the vehicle interior, thus preventing vibration of the floor surface.
 Preferably, the side sill includes a side sill inner disposed inside the vehicle body and a side sill outer disposed on the outside of the vehicle body such that the side sill inner and the side sill outer are joined to each other, the bulkhead
is coupled to the side sill inner having an upper inner surface, a side inner surface, and a lower inner surface such that the bulkhead is joined to the three inner surfaces, and a separating portion of the bulkhead which separates a space within the
side sill into front and rear parts is disposed on an extension of a load transfer path of a load transfer portion included in the reinforcing frame.
 With this configuration, the side sill inner is made of high-strength steel sheet in order to protect the vehicle interior against collision, thus increasing a reaction force against a collision load.  The bulkhead joined to the three inner
surfaces of the side sill inner prevents the cross-sectional shape of the side sill inner on the rear of the crush area from being deformed.  Since a collision load applied to a front wheel is linearly transferred through the bulkhead along the load
transfer path of the load transfer portion of the reinforcing frame and is received by the floor frame, the load applied to the crush area in front of the bulkhead can be increased, thus increasing impact absorbing performance.
 Preferably, the load transfer portion is an edge line defined by the upper surface and a side surface of the reinforcing frame.
 With this configuration, since the edge line defined by the upper and side surfaces of the reinforcing frame serves as the reinforced load transfer portion and the bulkhead is disposed on the extension of the load transfer path of the load
transfer portion, serving as the edge line, to support the side sill inner, the reinforcing frame can prevent the side sill from being deformed and bent due to a collision load caused upon narrow offset collision.
 Preferably, the reinforcing frame extends along a floor surface and the cross-sectional centroid of the side sill is positioned on an approximate extension of the edge line.
 With this configuration, since the reinforcing frame extends along the floor surface and the centroid of the side sill is disposed on the extension of the edge line, the reinforcing frame can receive a collision load caused upon narrow offset
collision, thus increasing the ability to transfer the collision load.  Furthermore, the reinforcing frame is curved along the floor surface, so that the lower surface of the reinforcing frame can be fitted to irregularities of the floor surface. 
Accordingly, the floor surface can be shaped so as to have a larger recess than a floor surface of a typical vehicle.  The floor frame can be disposed in the recess such that the lower surface of the floor is flattened.  Consequently, resistance to air
flowing along the lower surface of the floor can be reduced.
 Preferably, a floor panel forming the floor surface is coupled to the lower surface of the side sill inner.
 With this configuration, since the floor panel is coupled to the lower surface of the side sill inner, the height of the reinforcing frame formed along the floor surface can be increased by placement of the floor panel on the lower surface of
the side sill.  Advantageously, the cross-sectional area of the reinforcing frame is increased, thus increasing the strength.
 Preferably, the floor frame and the reinforcing frame are arranged on the lower surface of the floor panel.
 With this configuration, the floor panel, serving as the upper surface of the floor, can be supported flat by arrangement of the floor frame and the reinforcing frame on the lower surface of the floor, thus preventing vibration of the floor
panel.
 Preferably, the vehicle body lower structure includes a jack-up reinforcement plate disposed in the crush area, the jack-up reinforcement plate being resistant to a load acting along the height of the vehicle body and being sensitive to a load
acting along the length of the vehicle body.
 With this configuration, disposing the jack-up reinforcement plate allows the crush area to have jack-up support strength, which permits reception of a load acting along the height of the vehicle body during use of a jack, and crushability
(impact absorbability) under a collision load acting along the length of the vehicle body upon narrow offset collision.  Thus, these functions can be improved.
 According to the present embodiment, the vehicle body lower structure permits the front end part of the side sill to absorb a collision load caused upon narrow offset collision in order to prevent bending the side sill disposed under the door
opening so that the door can be opened and closed. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 A vehicle body lower structure according to an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 8B.  In the following description, the forward traveling direction of a vehicle C1 will be called ""front"", the
rearward traveling direction will be called ""rear"", the vertical upward direction will be called ""upper"", the vertical downward direction will be called ""lower"", and directions along the width of the vehicle will be called ""left"" and ""right"".
 Vehicle
 An example of the vehicle C1 to which the present embodiment is applied will be described prior to description of the vehicle body lower structure according to the embodiment of the present disclosure.  Referring to FIG. 1, the vehicle C1 is a
car which includes a motor room MR in vehicle body front part 1a and a vehicle interior (cabin) R disposed adjacent to the motor room MR, with a partition 6 therebetween.  For example, the vehicle C1 is a passenger automobile, such as a front-engine
rear-drive (FR) car or a four-wheel drive car.  The vehicle C1 includes a pair of right and left side sills 10 arranged on outer right and left sides of a vehicle body 1 and floor frames 17 arranged closer to the center of the vehicle body 1 than the
side sills 10.  So long as the vehicle C1 includes the side sills and the floor frames arranged as described above, the type and kind are not particularly limited.  The present embodiment will be described below with respect to an FR car.
 Vehicle Body
 Referring to FIG. 1, the vehicle body 1 forms the whole of the vehicle C1 and mainly includes various metal vehicle body frames, such as the side sills 10, the floor frames 17, and front side frames 3, a hood (not illustrated), a metal vehicle
body panel, such as a fender panel, and bumper faces (not illustrate) made of resin or metal.
 In the vehicle body front part 1a and vehicle body lower part 1b of the vehicle body 1, for example, a front bulkhead 2, a bumper beam (not illustrated), the front side frames 3, front wheel house upper members 4, front wheel houses 5, the
partition 6, front pillars 7, the side sills 10, reinforcing frames 12, the floor frames 17, jack-up reinforcement plates 13, outriggers (not illustrated), a front cross member 15, and tunnel frames 16 are generally symmetrically arranged such that each
pair of right and left components extend along the length of the vehicle body 1 and each single component extends in the vehicle width direction.  The above components will be described later.
 As described above, since the vehicle body lower part 1b has generally symmetrical configuration, left part of the vehicle body 1 will be mainly described below and explanation of right part thereof will be omitted as appropriate.
 Motor Room
 The motor room MR is a storage space in which a power unit (not illustrated) including, for example, an electric motor or an engine and a transmission is disposed.  The motor room MR is formed by frames and panel members arranged so as to
surround the storage space.  The front bulkhead 2 and the bumper beam (not illustrated) are arranged on the front of the motor room MR. The partition 6 and the front cross member 15 are arranged on the rear thereof.  The front bulkhead 2, the front wheel
house upper members 4, the front wheel houses 5, and the front pillars 7 are arranged on the upper right and left of the motor room MR. The pair of front side frames 3 extending along the length of the vehicle body 1 are arranged on the lower right and
left of the motor room MR.
 Front Bulkhead
 Referring to FIG. 1, the front bulkhead 2 is a frame member shaped so as to surround a radiator (not illustrated) on the front of the vehicle body 1 in the motor room MR. The front bulkhead 2 generally extends in the vehicle width direction. 
The bumper beam (not illustrated) is disposed in front of the front bulkhead 2.
 Front Side Frames
 Referring to FIG. 2, the front side frames 3 are a pair of right and left frame members, arranged in the vehicle body front part 1a, extending along the length of the vehicle body 1.  The front side frames 3 are formed by, for example, steel
square pipes, each of which has a generally rectangular cross section and is rigid from the front end to the rear end.  The bumper beam (not illustrated) is connected to the front ends of the front side frames 3 with bumper beam extensions (not
illustrated).  The pair of right and left front side frames 3 are shaped such that front parts of the frames extend along the length of the vehicle body 1 in parallel to each other and rear parts thereof are curved inwardly so as to make the distance
between the rear ends of the frames narrower than that between the front ends thereof.  The rear ends of the front side frames 3 are connected to the floor frames 17.  The front cross member 15 and the partition 6 are arranged between the front side
frames 3.
 Front Wheel House Upper Members and Front Wheel Houses
 Each front wheel house upper member 4 is a frame member disposed in an upper side portion of the motor room MR so as to extend along the length of the vehicle body 1.  The front end of the front wheel house upper member 4 is coupled to an upper
side portion of the front bulkhead 2, the rear end thereof is coupled to the front pillar 7, and lower part thereof is coupled to the front wheel house 5.  The front wheel house 5 is a panel member disposed so as to cover a side portion of the front
wheel T closer to the vehicle body 1, front and rear portions thereof, and an upper portion thereof with spacing therebetween.
 Partition
 Referring to FIG. 1, the partition 6 is a plate member separating the motor room MR from the vehicle interior R and includes, for example, a dashboard body (not illustrated) made of a steel sheet, a dashboard lower part 6a whose right and left
ends are joined to inner side surfaces of the side sills 10, a dashboard member formed by a frame member, and a reinforcing frame.
 Front Pillars
 The front pillars 7 are frame members extending from front end parts 10c (crush areas S) of the respective side sills 10 arranged in the vehicle body lower part 1b to right and left ends of a windshield (not illustrated) disposed above.  A pair
of upper and lower door hinge attachment stiffeners 71 openably supporting a front side door (not illustrated) are arranged in each front pillar 7.  The door hinge attachment stiffeners 71 are metal reinforcing members which reinforce the front pillar 7,
prevent the front pillar 7 from being deformed toward the door by a collision load F1 upon collision of the vehicle C1, and thus prevent the front side door from digging into a center pillar (not illustrated).
 Side Sills
 Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, each side sill 10 is a hollow frame member which extends from the lower end of the front pillar 7 along the length of the vehicle body 1 in parallel to an outer end portion of a floor panel 18 in the vehicle width
direction and which has a generally rectangular cross section (i.e., a shape having a closed cross section) and which is made of metal plate, such as a steel sheet.  The side sill 10 includes a side sill inner 10a disposed inside the vehicle body 1 and a
side sill outer 10b disposed on the outside of the vehicle body 1 such that the side sill inner 10a and the side sill outer 10b are joined to each other so as to form a closed cross section.  The side sill inner 10a has a generally U-shaped cross section
and is made of a high-strength steel sheet.  The side sill outer 10b has a generally U-shaped cross section.  The crush area S and the jack-up reinforcement plate 13 are positioned in a front portion of the front end part 10c of the side sill 10.  A
bulkhead 11 and a side-sill reinforcing bracket 10g are arranged inside the side sill 10 on the rear of the crush area S and the jack-up reinforcement plate 13.  The front end of the front end part 10c is coupled to the rear part of the front side frame
3 with the outrigger (not illustrated).  Furthermore, the bulkhead 11 is disposed inside the front end part 10c of the side sill 10 on the rear of the crush area S, which will be described later, so as to separate the space within the side sill 10 into
front and rear parts.  The front cross member 15, the outrigger (not illustrated), and the reinforcing frame 12 which are arranged in the vehicle width direction are joined to a side surface 10f of each side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R, thus
holding the right end of one floor panel 18 and the left end of the other floor panel 18.
 Bulkheads
 Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, each bulkhead 11 is a reinforcing member to reinforce the front end part 10c of the side sill 10 on the rear of the crush area S. The bulkhead 11 is made of a metal plate and is disposed so as to form a node in the
side sill 10.  The bulkhead 11 is provided in order to prevent the side sill inner 10a (refer to FIG. 6) from being crushed, in particular, upon a narrow offset collision such that the side sill inner 10a having a U-shaped cross section is opened or
dented.  The bulkhead 11 includes a separating portion 11a disposed so as to separate a space within the side sill inner 10a into front and rear parts and a flange 11b extending from the outer periphery of the separating portion 11a.
 The bulkhead 11 is disposed on an extension of an edge line 12d of the reinforcing frame 12 as viewed in plan to provide a function of concentrating the collision load F1 on the crush area S upon narrow offset collision while supporting the side
sill inner 10a on the side closer to the vehicle interior R to prevent the cross-sectional shape of the side sill inner 10a from being deformed under the collision load F1, and a function of transferring the collision load F1 applied to the side sill 10
to the reinforcing frame 12 to distribute the applied load.
 The separating portion 11a is disposed so as to separate the space within the side sill inner 10a, which is hollow, into front and rear parts.  The separating portion 11a is positioned perpendicular to an inner wall of the side sill inner 10a,
which forms half of the side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R and extends along the length of the vehicle body 1, thus increasing the strength of the side sill inner 10a.  A portion, where the bulkhead 11 is disposed and whose strength is
increased by the separating portion 11a, of the side sill inner 10a is therefore hard to deform, thus increasing the efficiency of transfer of the collision load F1 from the side sill 10 to the reinforcing frame 12.
 The flange 11b serves as a part to be welded to the U-shaped inner wall of the side sill inner 10a having an upper inner surface, a lower inner surface, and a side inner surface such that the flange 11b is joined to the three inner surfaces. 
The centroid O1 is the central point of the side sill 10 in cross section taken in the vehicle width direction.
 Crush Areas
 Referring to FIG. 3, each crush area S is formed so as to absorb the collision load F1 while being crushed under the collision load F1 upon collision between the vehicle C1 and the oncoming vehicle C2 (refer to FIG. 2).  The crush area S is
provided such that the strength of the front end part 10c positioned on the front of a connection point, at which the reinforcing frame 12 is connected to the side sill 10, rearwardly away from the front end of the side sill 10 by a predetermined
distance is less than the combined strength of the side sill 10 on the rear of the connection point and the reinforcing frame 12.  The range of the crush area S along the length of the vehicle body 1 extends from the portion (connection point), where the
bulkhead 11 is disposed, of the side sill 10 to the front end of the side sill 10 and the range thereof along the height of the vehicle body 1 extends from the lower end of the side sill 10 to the upper end thereof.  In the crush area S, the jack-up
reinforcement plate 13 is disposed which reinforces a portion where a jack (not illustrated) used to raise the vehicle body 1 is set.
 Jack-up Reinforcement Plates
 Referring to FIG. 3, each jack-up reinforcement plate 13 is made of metal plate which is resistant to a load acting along the height of the vehicle body 1 by, for example, placement of a bead along the height of the vehicle body 1 and which is
sensitive to a load acting along the length of the vehicle body 1 such that the jack-up reinforcement plate is crushable upon a narrow offset collision.  Referring to FIG. 3, the jack-up reinforcement plate 13 is joined to the side sill 10 and the front
pillar 7 so as to cover a side surface of the front end part 10c of the side sill 10 further from the vehicle interior and the lower end of the front pillar 7.
 Reinforcing Frames
 Referring to FIG. 3, each reinforcing frame 12 is a reinforcement frame member which receives the collision load F1 while holding the side surface 10f of the side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R in order to prevent the side sill 10 from
being deformed and bent inwardly upon a narrow offset collision between the vehicle C1 and the oncoming vehicle C2 (refer to FIG. 2).  The reinforcing frame 12 is made of a steel sheet and is generally hat-shaped in cross section by press bending.
 The reinforcing frame 12 includes a load transfer portion 12a to transfer a collision load F2 applied to one end (outer joint 12f) of the reinforcing frame 12 to the other end (inner joint 12g) and has a horizontally flat upper surface 12b, side
surfaces 12c downwardly extending from both side edges of the upper surface 12b, and the edge lines 12d each corresponding to the bent boundary between the upper surface 12b and the side surface 12c.  The reinforcing frame 12 further includes flanges 12e
horizontally extending from the lower ends of the side surfaces 12c, the outer joint 12f joined to the side surface 10f of the side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R, and the inner joint 12g joined to the upper surface of the floor frame 17.
 Referring to FIGS. 3 to 5, the one end of the reinforcing frame 12 is joined to surface part 10d (refer to FIGS. 6 and 7) of the portion, where the bulkhead 11 is disposed, of the side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R. The reinforcing
frame 12 extends rearwardly and inwardly in the vehicle width direction from such a junction.  The other end of the reinforcing frame 12 is joined to the floor frame 17.
 Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the load transfer portion 12a, which includes either or both of the edge lines 12d of the bent reinforcing frame 12, is a part whose strength is increased by the bent boundary between the upper surface 12b forming the
edge line 12d and the side surface 12c positioned on each side of the upper surface 12b in the longitudinal direction thereof.  Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the load transfer portion 12a is disposed such that an approximate extension of a load transfer
path extends below the centroid O1 of the side sill 10 in this embodiment.  It is desirable that the extension pass through the centroid O1 from the viewpoint of load transfer.
 The upper surface 12b is flat so as to be flush with the upper surface of the floor frame 17.  The side surfaces 12c downwardly extend from the side edges of the upper surface 12b so as to slightly diverge from each other.
 The edge lines 12d are reinforcing parts bent at an approximately right angle to increase the strength of the reinforcing frame 12.  The edge lines 12d are arranged on both sides of the upper surface 12b so as to extend along the length of the
upper surface 12b.  The flanges 12e are portions shaped so as to fit a floor surface 18a such that each flange extends on floor recessed part 18d (refer to FIG. 6), which is below floor raised part 18c of the floor panel 18, and floor inclined part 18e. 
The flanges 12e are arranged on and joined to the floor surface 18a.
 The outer joint 12f is a portion bent at an approximately right angle such that the outer end of the reinforcing frame 12 further from the vehicle interior abuts against the side surface 10f of the side sill 10 while fitting the side surface
10f.  The outer joint 12f is joined to the side surface 10f.
 The inner joint 12g is a portion bent such that the inner end of the reinforcing frame 12 closer to the vehicle interior abuts against the side and upper surfaces of the floor frame 17 while fitting the side and upper surfaces.  The inner joint
12g is joined to the side and upper surfaces of the floor frame 17.
 Front Cross Member
 Referring to FIG. 1, the front cross member 15 is a transversely extending member disposed between the right and left side sills 10 and has a generally hat-shaped cross section such that it has a lower opening.  The front cross member 15 is made
of a metal thick plate, such as a rigid steel sheet.  The front cross member 15 is called ""dash lower cross member"" or ""dashboard cross member"".  The front cross member 15 includes flanges for junction and reinforcement in the front and rear lower ends
and the right and left ends.  The front cross member 15 is disposed so as to extend in the vehicle width direction such that the junction flanges (not illustrated) in the right and left ends are joined to the inner side surfaces 10f of the side sills 10
and the lower junction flanges (not illustrated) are joined to the dashboard lower part 6a.
 Floor Cross Members
 Referring to FIGS. 1, 2, 6, and 7, floor cross members 19 are arranged such that one floor cross member extends between the right side sill 10 and tunnel part 1c and the other floor cross member extends between the left side sill 10 and the
tunnel part 1c.  Each floor cross member 19 is a generally hat-shaped cross-section frame member made of a steel sheet.  The floor cross member 19 is disposed orthogonal to the floor frame 17 such that the floor frame 17 extends under the middle of the
floor cross member 19 in the vehicle width direction.
 Tunnel Frames
 Referring to FIG. 6, the tunnel frames 16 are arranged so as to extend along the length of the vehicle body 1 in right and left ends of the tunnel part 1c disposed in the middle of the floor in the vehicle interior R in the vehicle width
direction.  Each tunnel frame 16 is a generally hat-shaped cross-section member made of a metal plate.  The two right and left tunnel frames 16 have strength increased by arrangement of a tunnel cross member and another cross member (which are not
illustrated) and securely support the floor frames 17, the outriggers (not illustrated), and the partition 6 (refer to FIG. 1) arranged in front end parts of the tunnel frames 16.
 Floor Frames
 Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the floor frames 17 are generally hat-shaped cross-section frame members for holding the floor panels 18 constituting the floor of the vehicle body 1.  The floor frames 17 are joined to the floor panels 18 such that
the upper and lower floor frames 17 sandwich the same portion of the floor panel 18 on each of the right and left of the vehicle body 1 (refer to FIGS. 6 and 7).  Accordingly, the floor frames 17 can hold the floor panels 18 such that the floor surfaces
18a are kept flat.  The front ends of the floor frames 17 are connected to the rear parts of the front side frames 3.  Parts of the upper floor frames 17 closer to the middle of the vehicle body 1 in the vehicle width direction are coupled to the inner
joints 12g of the reinforcing frames 12 and the lower surfaces of the floor cross members 19.  Rear parts of the floor frames 17 are outwardly bent and the rear ends thereof are joined to the side surfaces 10f of the right and left side sills 10 closer
to the vehicle interior R.
 Floor Panels
 Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, the floor panels 18 are metal plate members forming the floor surfaces 18a in the vehicle interior R and each extend between the tunnel part 1c and the corresponding side sill 10.  The floor surface 18a of each floor
panel 18 includes the floor raised part 18c adjacent to the tunnel part 1c in the middle of the vehicle body 1 in the vehicle width direction, the floor recessed part 18d positioned below the floor raised part 18c, and the floor inclined part 18e
upwardly diagonally extending from the floor recessed part 18d.  The tunnel frame 16 is attached to a lower surface 18b of the floor panel 18 in the floor raised part 18c and the reinforcing frame 12 (refer to FIGS. 1 and 2) is disposed on the upper
surface of the floor panel 18 in the floor recessed part 18d and the floor inclined part 8e.  An outer end portion 18f of the floor inclined part 18e is joined to the side surface 10f of the side sill 10.
 Function of Vehicle Body Lower Structure
 A function of the vehicle body lower structure according to the embodiment of the present disclosure will now be described with respect to a narrow offset collision between front left part of the vehicle body 1 of the vehicle C1 and the oncoming
vehicle C2 with reference to FIGS. 1 to 8B.
 Referring to FIGS. 8A and 8B, in the narrow offset collision between the vehicle C1 and the oncoming vehicle C2, the oncoming vehicle C2 passes the front left part of the vehicle body 1, i.e., the left end of the front bulkhead 2 and a portion
outside the front side frame 3 (refer to FIG. 1) such that the front wheel house upper member 4, the front wheel house 5, the front wheel T, the front pillar 7, the front end part 10c of the side sill 10, and the jack-up reinforcement plate 13 are
pressed rearward (in the direction of the collision load F1) and crushed by the oncoming vehicle C2.  In particular, the front side frame 3, which is rigid, of the oncoming vehicle C2 presses the front wheel T in front of the side sill 10.  The wheel
rearwardly presses the front end part 10c of the side sill 10.
 Referring to FIG. 3, the crush area S is disposed in the front end part 10c of the side sill 10 in order to improve the ability to absorb the collision load F1.  The bulkhead 11 and the side-sill reinforcing bracket 10g are arranged inside the
side sill 10 on the rear of the crush area S to increase the strength and stiffness.  Furthermore, the side of the portion, where the bulkhead 11 is disposed, of the side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R is supported by the reinforcing frame 12,
thus preventing the side sill 10 from being bent.  Accordingly, the strength of the portion, in which the bulkhead 11 is disposed and which is coupled to the reinforcing frame 12, of the side sill 10 is higher than that of the crush area S on the front
of the portion.
 Consequently, the crush area S in the front end part 10c on the front of the portion, where the bulkhead 11 is disposed, is locally crushed by the collision load F1, thus absorbing the collision load F1 to prevent part on the rear of the
portion, where the bulkhead 11 is disposed, of the side sill 10 from being deformed.
 As regards the collision load F1 applied to the front end part 10c of the side sill 10, since the strength of the portion where the bulkhead 11 is disposed is high and the side sill 10 is coupled to the reinforcing frame 12 rearwardly diagonally
extending from this portion, the collision load F1 is transferred and distributed to the side sill 10 and the reinforcing frame 12 and the collision load F2 distributed to the reinforcing frame 12 is transferred to the floor frame 17.  In other words,
the collision load F1 applied to the front end part 10c of the side sill 10 is received by the portion, where the bulkhead 11 is disposed, of the side sill 10, so that the side sill 10 is prevented from being bent.
 Since the side sill 10 is not bent, therefore, the shape of a door opening above the side sill 10 on the rear of the crush area S is kept such that a front side door (not illustrated) is prevented from being difficult to open.  Thus, the door is
openable after collision.
 Furthermore, although the crush area S in the front end part 10c of the side sill 10 is deformed by the collision load F1, part on the rear of the front end part 10c, namely, the portion of the side sill 10 where the bulkhead 10 is disposed is
hard to deform.  Thus, the shape of the door opening can be prevented from being deformed.
 Furthermore, since the reinforcing frame 12 extends between the side sill 10 and the floor frame 17 such that one end of the reinforcing frame 12 is connected to the side sill 10 and the other end thereof is joined to the floor frame 17, the
reinforcing frame 12 securely holds the floor surface 18a in the vehicle interior R. In addition, the floor panel 18 is held such that the floor surface 18a is joined to the hat-shaped cross-section floor frames 17 and the hat-shaped cross-section tunnel
frame 16 as illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7.  Accordingly, vibration of the floor panel 18 is prevented.
 Furthermore, the floor panel 18 joined to the dashboard lower part 6a disposed on the side of the front end part 10c of the side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R, as illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, is prevented from being separated
therefrom due to the collision load F1, because the strength and impact absorbability of the side sill 10 are increased.
 As described above, in the structure of the vehicle body lower part 1b according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the crush area S in the front end of each side sill 10 improves the ability to absorb the collision load F1 applied
upon narrow offset collision, each bulkhead 11 increases the strength of the portion where the bulkhead 11 is disposed on the rear of the crush area S, and each reinforcing frame 12 supporting the side of the portion, where the bulkhead 11 is disposed,
of the side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R prevents the side sill 10 from being bent, thus facilitating deformation of the front end part 10c of each side sill 10 to improve the impact absorbability.  Since the strength of the portion of the
side sill 10 on the rear of the front end part 10c is increased and the portion, therefore, hardly deforms, the shape of each of right and left ends of the bottom of the vehicle interior R and opening and closing of the doors are not affected by the
collision.
 Modifications
 The present embodiment is not limited to the foregoing embodiment and many modifications and variations are possible within the scope of technical idea of the disclosure.  Thus, it is intended that the present embodiment covers the modifications
and variations of the disclosure.  The same components as those described above are designated by the same reference numerals and description thereof is omitted.
 FIGS. 9A to 9C are diagrams illustrating modifications of the vehicle body lower structure according to the foregoing embodiment.  FIG. 9A is a schematic cross-sectional view of a reinforcing frame in a first modification.  FIG. 9B is a
schematic cross-sectional view of a reinforcing frame in a second modification.  FIG. 9C is a schematic cross-sectional view of a reinforcing frame in a third modification.
 First Modification
 In the foregoing embodiment, each reinforcing frame 12 is disposed such that the inner joint 12g is joined to the upper surface of the floor frame 17, the outer joint 12f is joined to the outer end 18f of the floor panel 18 and the side surface
10f of the side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R, and the load transfer portion 12a (edge line 12d) is positioned below the cross-sectional centroid O1 of the side sill 10 as illustrated in FIG. 5.  The placement is not limited to the above one.
 For example, a reinforcing frame 12A may be disposed such that an approximate extension O2 of a load transfer portion 12Aa (edge line 12Ad) extends so as to pass through the cross-sectional centroid O1 of the side sill 10 as illustrated in FIG.
9A.
 In this case, as illustrated in FIG. 9A, the reinforcing frame 12A is shaped such that the load transfer portion 12Aa (edge line 12Ad) of the reinforcing frame 12A is higher than the load transfer portion 12a (edge line 12d) of the reinforcing
frame 12 by a distance indicated by the arrow H1 and the centroid O1 of the bulkhead 11 and the side sill 10 is positioned on the extension of a load transfer path of the load transfer portion 12Aa (edge line 12Ad) of the reinforcing frame 12A.  An outer
joint 12Af of the reinforcing frame 12A is joined to the side surface 10f of the side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R and an inner joint 12Ag thereof is joined to an upper surface 17Aa of a floor frame 17A.
 In this placement, the collision load F2 applied to the side sill 10 acts straight along the edge line 12Ad, thus further allowing the edge line 12Ad (the load transfer portion 12Aa) to increase ability to transfer the collision load F1.
 The load transfer portion 12Aa may be disposed on the approximate extension O2 of the load transfer path.  The load transfer portion 12Aa may be disposed on the horizontal extension O2, as illustrated in FIG. 9A, or may be a portion to which the
collision load F2 is applied diagonally.
 In this case, the bulkhead 11 is disposed at an angle relative to the length of the side sill 10 such that the separating portion 11a coincides with the side sill 10 when viewed in plan.  Alternatively, the bulkhead 11 is disposed perpendicular
to the length of the side sill 10 such that part of the separating portion 11a intersects the extension line O2.  In other words, it is necessary that the bulkhead 11 partly intersect the extension line O2 of the load transfer path.
 Second Modification
 While the foregoing embodiment has been described with respect to the case where the outer end 18f of each floor panel 18 is joined to the side surface 10f of the corresponding side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R as illustrated in FIG.
5, the placement is not limited to the above one.
 A floor panel 18B may be joined to a lower surface 10e of the side sill 10 as illustrated in FIG. 9B.  In this placement, the height, indicated at H2, of a reinforcing frame 12B between each flange 12Be near an outer joint 12Bf and an edge line
12Bd is increased, so that the cross-sectional area of the reinforcing frame 12B can be increased with increase in height.  Thus, the increased strength can be provided.
 Furthermore, the reinforcing frame 12B may be formed horizontally as illustrated in FIG. 9B.  In this case, the outer joint 12Bf of the reinforcing frame 12B is joined to the side surface 10f of the side sill 10 closer to the vehicle interior R
and an inner joint 12Bg thereof is joined to an upper surface 17Ba of the floor frame 17B.  Accordingly, since the edge line 12Bg extends linearly in a manner similar to the first modification, the ability of transfer the collision load F1 can be
increased.
 Third Modification
 A reinforcing frame 12C and a floor frame 17C may be arranged below a floor surface 18Ca of each floor panel 18C as illustrated in FIG. 9C.  In this arrangement, since the floor panel 18C may be formed flat, the floor surface 18Ca can be
flattened.
 In this case, the floor frame 17C is joined to the floor panel 18C such that flanges 17Cb and 17Cc are placed on the upper side.  The upper surface of each flange 12Ce of the reinforcing frame 12C is joined to the floor frame 17C and an outer

 This disclosure is directed to a sunshade, and particularly to a sunshade hook assembly or sunshade hook associated with rear door sunshades in a vehicle.  At least selected aspects may find application in related environments and applications.
 One or more hooks are typically mounted along an upper portion of a frame forming a window opening, for example, in a vehicle door.  A flexible sunshade is typically stored in a rolled fashion adjacent a top region of a door lining near a base
portion of the window opening.  The sunshade is configured to be selectively lifted upwardly from the door lining and extended or deployed by a customer toward the hooks at the upper portion of the window opening.  When lifted or deployed in this
fashion, reinforced openings formed in the sunshade along an upper edge thereof are dimensioned for mounting receipt on the hooks adjacent the top of the window opening.  Occasionally under certain conditions, the sunshade can become unhooked when
disposed in a deployed condition.  This inadvertently occurs, for example, if a customer is driving with a rear window in a down or open position, and appears to be more particularly associated with a situation where an opposite front window of the
vehicle is also in a down or open condition.  As a result of the open windows, the front portion of the sunshade can become unhooked while a rear portion or remainder of the extended sunshade remains secured to the hook.  This action subjects the
sunshade and associated hooks to additional forces as a result of the wind blowing.
 Under extreme conditions, the hook may break in response to these additional forces.  It has been determined that the rear hook oftentimes breaks of the first and second hooks that secure the sunshade over the rear window opening.  Breaking the
rear hook most often occurs because the airflow in the vehicle tends to unhook the front portion of the sunshade.  Additional forces are then imposed on the rear hook, particularly a twisting torque is applied to the rear hook by the rear potion of the
sunshade as a result of the front portion of the sunshade becoming unhooked.  It was also determined that breakage typically occurred along the hook rather than the sunshade.
 Accordingly, it has been determined that modifications would be helpful with regard to the structure and design of the sunshade hook in order to limit the prospect for the sunshade becoming unhooked and preventing the hook from breaking, and
that also enhances the ability of the sunshade assembly to withstand the force and stress imposed on the sunshade hook and associated bracket even if one portion of the sunshade becomes unhooked and additional forces are imposed on the remaining hook.
SUMMARY
 A sunshade assembly for an associated vehicle includes a sunshade having a rod-shaped member adjacent a first edge.  The rod-shaped member has a cross-sectional dimension adapted for receipt in a generally J-shaped hook formed by a leg portion
extending from a mounting base portion, and a generally curvilinear portion extending from the leg portion toward a terminal end that forms a substantially closed cavity that receives the rod-shaped member of the sunshade therein.  The sunshade includes
an opening formed adjacent the rod-shaped member that defines a sunshade dimension extending between the rod-shaped member and an opposite edge of the opening.  The terminal end of the hook is spaced from the base portion by an access passage dimension
slightly greater than the cross-sectional dimension of the rod-shaped member and defines an access passage that opens into the cavity.  The sunshade dimension is less than a retention dimension extending between the terminal end of the hook and an
external bight portion of the hook to preclude inadvertent removal of the rod-shaped member from the cavity.
 The access passage is preferably formed by substantially parallel surfaces of the base portion and terminal end of the hook.  The spacing between the parallel surfaces extends through an angle of approximately 90.degree..
 A curvilinear portion of the hook extends over greater than 180.degree.  from the leg portion so that the terminal end of the hook at least partially overlaps the rod-shaped member of the sunshade.
 The base portion includes a stem with a generally rectangular cross-sectional conformation that includes deflectable clips that extend outwardly from substantially opposite corner regions of the stem.
 The stem preferably includes first and second perimeter regions interposed between the first and second deflectable clips, where each of the perimeter regions extends continuously from a mid-length position on one side past a mid-length position
on a contiguous side of the stem.
 One benefit is the improved stiffness around the clip portion.
 Still another benefit resides in the increased cross-sectional area of the stem which improves the toughness of the shearing stress.
 The preferred configuration of the hook overlaps the rod to limit the prospects of the rod from inadvertently travelling vertically out of the hook cavity.
 A slight interference is encountered upon removal of the sunshade from the hook to help keep the rod-shaped member in place.
 Still other benefits and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent from reading and understanding the following detailed description. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 Turning first to FIG. 1, a portion of a vehicle, specifically a rear door 100 having a window opening 102 formed in the door, is shown.  A sunshade 110 is shown in a partial, almost fully open or deployed condition where a flexible fabric member
that forms the sunshade is extended into a generally planar condition from a first or lower edge 112 of the window opening to a second or upper edge 114 of the window opening.  Along the second edge of the window opening are provided plural hooks 116
(shown here as preferably first and second hooks) which are adapted for receipt in associated openings 118 of the sunshade.  More particularly, a reinforced edge 120 of the sunshade 110 includes a rod-shaped member 122 which is dimensioned for receipt in
the J-shaped hook 116 (FIG. 2).  Thus, the rod-shaped member 122 is received within a lower, bight portion 124 of the hook.  The bight portion 124 of the hook is interposed between a first leg 126 extending outwardly from base portion 128 and terminal
end portion 130 of the hook.  In a storage position of the sunshade (not shown), the flexible sunshade fabric 110 is typically stored in a rolled form around a spring-biased core, which spring-bias urges the sunshade into a normally closed position wound
around the core disposed in the door beneath the lower edge of the window opening and only a minimal portion of the sunshade extending upwardly for grasping by the user.  When the user wishes to deploy the sunshade, the reinforced edge of the sunshade
(or some other structure that facilitates grasping the sunshade) is pulled upwardly until the openings 118 are mounted on the hooks 116 as generally shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
 As described in the Background, under certain conditions, the sunshade 110 can become disconnected from one of the hooks 116, which can potentially lead to breakage of the hook 116 or sunshade 110.  This problem is particularly acute when the
window is open and the vehicle is being driven at a higher speed while the sunshade is held on one of the hooks (see FIG. 1).  Thus, as shown in FIG. 3, when the sunshade 110 is deployed and properly seated in the bight 124 of the J-shaped hook 116, the
bias of the storage spring (not shown) exerts a downward force on the sunshade and retains the rod-shaped member 122 in the bight portion 124 of the hook.  However, forces on the sunshade, for example as imposed by an open window when the vehicle is
driven, can lift the rod-shaped member 122 to the position shown as 122' (FIG. 3) where the opening 118' in the reinforced portion 120' is lifted up and over the terminal end 130 of one or more of the hooks 116.  This could lead to a condition as shown
in FIG. 1 where the sunshade 110 is originally retained on each of the hooks and one of the openings 118 of the sunshade 110 works loose from an associated hook which can potentially lead to breaking the hook or the sunshade.
 The subject new arrangement of FIGS. 4-7 illustrates a new sunshade hook or hook assembly 216 that overcomes these noted problems.  Particularly, the new sunshade hook 216 has a generally J-shape formed by a first or leg portion 226 that extends
from a mounting or base portion 228 through bight region 224 to a terminal end 230.  As is evident in FIGS. 4-7 when the new hook 216 is compared to the prior art hook 116, the configuration of the J-shaped hook 216 includes a longer or extended leg
portion 226 and a greater degree of curvature of the terminal end 230 toward the leg portion 226 so that it is more difficult for the rod-shaped member 222 to be inadvertently removed from the bight region 224 and over the terminal end 230.  More
particularly, access passage 240 provides selective access to internal hook cavity 242 and the access passage preferably has an access passage dimension 244 that receives the rod-shaped member 222 therethrough for access to the internal cavity 242 of the
J-shaped hook 216.  The substantially closed cavity 242 is defined by the leg portion 226, bight portion 224, and terminal end 230, and the terminal end curves a greater degree toward the leg portion than the prior art arrangement so that the hook 216
further confines the rod-shaped member 222 in the cavity.  The access passage dimension 244 is slightly greater than the cross-sectional dimension 246 of the rod-shaped member to allow the rod-shaped member to pass therethrough, and also reduce the
potential for the sunshade to be inadvertently removed from the cavity 242.
 Preferably, a rib 250 angles inwardly from an intersection of the base portion 228 with the leg portion 226 to more particularly control the dimension 244 of the access passage 240.  In the preferred arrangement, the rib extends over only a
portion of the width of the hook.  Moreover, the rib is centered between opposite ends in the hook cavity.  Thus, the spacing between the rib and the curved terminal end potion 230 of the hook is substantially constant in a generally counter-clockwise
direction through approximately 90.degree..  The rib 250 and leg portion 226 maintain a generally constant spacing therebetween (sometimes referred to herein as a ""parallel"" relation) with the contour of the terminal end 230 of the hook 226 and that
access passage dimension 244 is only slightly greater than the cross-sectional dimension 246 of the rod-shaped member.
 Another improvement is particularly illustrated in FIGS. 6-7 where a retention dimension 260 (FIG. 6) defined between the terminal end 230 and an external surface of the bight portion 224 is greater than a sunshade dimension 262 (see FIG. 7
where the sunshade dimension is measured between the rod-shaped member 222 and an edge of the opening 218 opposite the rod-shaped member.  This dimensional relationship between the retention dimension 260 and the sunshade dimension 262 prevents
inadvertent removal of the rod-shaped member 222 of the sunshade from the hook cavity 242.  That is, as illustrated in FIG. 7, the surface of the reinforced portion defined at opening 218 is spaced from the rod-shaped member 222 by the sunshade dimension
262 to provide contact with the hook if the rod-shaped member is lifted vertically upward from the bight toward the access passage.  This contact between the hook and the opening edge 218 of the sunshade prevents inadvertent removal of the sunshade as
represented in FIG. 7.  Instead, the sunshade must be rotated (in a generally counter-clockwise direction as illustrated by reference arrow 264 in FIG. 6) about the rod-shaped member seated in the hook cavity until the sunshade 210 approaches the
terminal end 230 and the rod-shaped member can be removed through the access passage.  As will be appreciated, this controlled, purposeful movement of the sunshade and rod-shaped member is not inadvertent and is undertaken by the user to mount and remove
the rod-shaped member through the access passage 240 of the hook.  Further, it is unlikely that this orientation of the sunshade relative to the access passage of the hook will be randomly encountered as a result of the force of the wind, for example,
and therefore the sunshade will be maintained in a stable position in the hook.
 In addition, the curvilinear portion of the hook that continues from the leg portion 226 toward the terminal end 230 preferably extends over greater than 180.degree.  from the leg portion.  In this manner, the terminal end of the hook at least
partially overlaps the rod-shaped member of the sunshade in the mounted position (see FIG. 6).  This extended curvature of the hook 216 further contributes to retaining the rod-shaped member 222 in the hook cavity and prevents inadvertent removal.
 In the prior art arrangement of FIGS. 8 and 9, a stem 170 extends from the base portion 128 of the hook in a direction generally opposite of the J-shaped hook for receipt in mounting bracket 180.  Deflectable legs 172 extended from opposite
sides of the stem 170 to form undercut shoulder portions 174 that engage or snap-fit through an opening 182 in the bracket.  Four corner regions or posts 176 abuttingly engaged the opening 182 in the bracket 180 (FIG. 9), and thus the mounting rigidity
and contact between the stem 170 of the hook and the bracket 180 was generally confined to these corner regions 176, along with the deflectable undercut shoulders 174.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, and more particularly shown in FIGS. 10-12, deflectable legs 272 of the new hook are moved toward opposite corner regions 290 of stem 270 so that a pair of enlarged corners 290 engage opening 282 in the bracket
280.  That is, first and second perimeter regions of the stem 270 extend continuously from a mid-length position on one side (292 in FIG. 12) past a mid-length position 294 on a contiguous side of the stem 270.  In this manner, the deflectable legs 272
extend from substantially opposite corner regions and are configured for receipt through the generally rectangular opening 282 in the bracket, snap outwardly so that retaining shoulders 274 engage the bracket, and position the enlarged corner regions 290
for a substantially enlarged perimeter engagement 292, 294 with the bracket 280.  This adds desired strength and rigidity to the structure in order to counteract shear stresses imposed on the hook when the deployed sunshade is received in the hook and is
subjected to twisting forces.
 In conclusion, the hook shape is made parallel in the access passage region between the rib 250 and the terminal end 230 through approximately 90.degree.  to keep the rod-shaped member 222 in the cavity 242 of the hook.  This configuration makes
it more difficult for the rod-shaped member to travel a parallel path accidently or inadvertently, e.g., as a result of the wind blowing.  The extended curvature of the terminal end 230 overlapping the rod-shaped member also advantageously retains the
rod-shaped member and prevents the rod-shaped member from travelling vertically outward of the cavity when the wind is blowing.  The retention dimension between the terminal end of the hook and the outer surface of the bight is greater than the sunshade
dimension measured between the rod-shaped member and the sunshade opening so that a slight interference upon insertion and removal is developed which helps maintain the rod-shaped member in the hook.  Further, the stem 270 is modified to maximize
rigidity and contact area with the opening in the bracket.  Stiffness is improved by increasing the cross-sectional area of the stem which engages the bracket 280 and improves the toughness or level of shearing stress which the stem and bracket can
withstand.  Thus, the effective cross-sectional perimeter area 292, 294 that the stem engages in the bracket opening is enlarged to improve the ability to withstand this shearing stress.
 The disclosure has been described with reference to preferred embodiments.  Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description.  It is intended that the disclosure be
construed as including all such modifications and alterations.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 An object of one embodiment of the invention is to provide a gas spring that provides a return stroke along a fixed distance when an additional force in excess of the extension force of the gas spring acts in the extension direction of the gas
spring.
 According to one embodiment of the invention a connection element with a socket housing is arranged at the first end and a connection element with a socket housing is arranged at the free end of the piston rod for receiving a ball head, at least
one of the two socket housings comprising a ball socket that has a longitudinal extension and a transverse dimension, the longitudinal extension greater than the transverse dimension.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 The piston-cylinder unit shown in FIG. 1 is constructed as a gas spring with a cylinder 1, wherein a piston 2 is arranged so as to be axially displaceable, the gas-filled interior of the cylinder 1 which is under pressure is divided by this
piston 2 into a first cylinder chamber 3 and a second cylinder chamber 4.  The piston 2 can have overflow openings in the form of through-holes or, as is shown in this instance, a piston ring 5 under which flow can occur in at least one direction. 
Further, at least one axial groove 6 through which fluid can flow around the piston 2 can be formed in the cylinder 1.
 On the side of the first cylinder chamber 3, the cylinder 1 has a closed first end 7 at which a threaded pin 8 is arranged concentric to the center longitudinal axis A of the cylinder 1.  A connection element 9 is screwed onto the threaded pin 8
with a receiving chamber 11 formed in a fastening stud 10.  A piston rod 12 is arranged at the piston 2.  This piston rod 12 extends through the second cylinder chamber 4 concentric to the center longitudinal axis A and is guided out of the cylinder 1
via a sealing and guiding device 13 at a second end 14 opposite the first end 7.  A threaded portion 15 on which another connection element 16 is screwed is formed at the free end of the piston rod 12 located outside the cylinder 1.
 As is shown in more detail in FIGS. 2a, 2b and 2c, the connection element 16 has a socket housing 17.  A receiving chamber 18 by which the connection element 16 is screwed to the threaded portion 15 is formed in the socket housing 17.  A closed
ball socket 19 with a longitudinal extension 19a and a transverse dimension 19b is formed in the socket housing 17, the longitudinal extension 19a being greater than the transverse dimension 19b.  An insertion opening 20 leads outward from ball socket 19
transverse to the longitudinal extension of the receiving chamber 18.  A ball head 21 of a ball stud 22 has a diameter corresponding to the transverse dimension 19b and is pivotably inserted into the ball socket 19 via the insertion opening 20, this ball
stud 22 having a gudgeon 23 extending radially from the ball head 21 for fastening to a structural component part, e.g., a body part of a motor vehicle.
 Two feed slots 24, whose ends open into through-slots 25 at mid-height with respect to the ball socket 19, extend symmetrically from the front side opposite the receiving chamber 18.  The through-slots 25 are constructed so as to converge
symmetrically with respect to one another and open out approximately in the transitional area between the ball socket 19 and the insertion opening 20.
 A C-shaped spring clamp 26 comprising a spring clip and having a substantially rectangular cross section has converging free ends 27 corresponding to the converging through-slots 25.  The cross section of the spring clip substantially
corresponds to the cross section of the through-slots 25, and the thickness of the spring clip substantially corresponds to the width of the feed slots 24.
 To assemble the spring clamp 26, the free ends 27 of this spring clamp 26 are inserted through the feed slots 24 from the front side of the socket housing 17 until the through-slots 25 and are then displaced inward through the through-slots 25
until the spring clamp 26 contacts the socket housing 17 so as to encircle it by the curved portion 28 connecting the free ends 27.  The length of the free ends 27 is so dimensioned that the free ends 27 project into the insertion opening 20 and contact
the ball head 21 so as to act upon the latter in the ball socket 18.
 In this installation position of the spring clamp 26, the curved portion 28 of the spring clamp 26 is positioned between locking cams 29 which protrude at the outer surface of the socket housing 17 remote of the insertion opening 20 and which
prevent a self-displacement of the spring clamp 26.
 The ball head 21 is arranged in the ball socket 19 so as to be displaceable along the center longitudinal axis A. This is made possible in that, on the one hand, the ball socket 19 has a longitudinal extension 19a and a transverse dimension 19b,
where the longitudinal extension 19a is greater than the transverse dimension 19b, and, on the other hand, the width of the spring clamp 26 along the center longitudinal axis A is so dimensioned that the ball stud 22 can also be displaced along the
center longitudinal axis A at the same time.
 FIGS. 3a and 3b show another example of an embodiment of the connection element 16'.  FIG. 3b shows a section through the connection element 16'.  The spring clamp 26 has the usual width and is therefore displaceable along the center
longitudinal axis A together with an inserted ball head 21 in the through-slots 25.  The locking cams 29 in turn serve as stops for the spring clamp 26 to limit the axial movement of the spring clamp 26.
 FIGS. 4a and 4b show another embodiment form of the piston cylinder unit according to the invention.  A catch element 30 is arranged on the threaded pin 8 at the first end 7 of the cylinder 1.  The catch element 30 has at least one flexible
spring tongue 31 which is bent the first end 7 of the cylinder 1.  Together with the catch element 30 screwed onto the threaded pin 8, the first end 7 of the cylinder 1 is pushed into a cover tube 32 until the at least one spring tongue 31 locks into a
recess 33 associated with it in the cover tube 32.
 In each instance, the at least one recess 33 is formed substantially as an axial groove or elongated hole so that the cylinder 1 of the gas spring is movable along the center longitudinal axis A. A conventional connection element 34, for
example, a ball socket or a knuckle eye, is arranged at the end of the cover tube 32 for fastening to a structural component part, e.g., a body part of a motor vehicle.
 When the embodiment forms described above are used in a motor vehicle, as is shown in FIG. 5, the gas spring with its cylinder 1 under pressure in a first operating state assists in opening the engine hood 35, for example, to perform maintenance
work in the engine compartment.  In a second operating state, for example, in detecting a collision with a pedestrian, in which the engine hood 35 is moved very quickly into a protective position by an actuator 36, for example, by a pyrotechnic actuator,
the gas spring serves to damp the opening movement of the engine hood 35 into the protective position so as to prevent the engine hood 35 from over-swinging, since otherwise it is possible that the collision with the pedestrian can take place when the
engine hood is insufficiently raised.
 To prevent premature damping of the opening movement into the protective position, the gas spring can carry out a return stroke until the damping can finally be carried out by the gas spring.
 Thus, while there have shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and
details of the devices illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.  For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and/or method steps
which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention.  Moreover, it should be recognized that structures and/or elements and/or method steps shown and/or described
in connection with any disclosed form or embodiment of the invention may be incorporated in any other disclosed or described or suggested form or embodiment as a general matter of design choice.  It is the intention, therefore, to be limited only as
indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto.

 The present invention relates to a vehicle body rear part structure having a spare tire carrier which is comprised of a frame part, provided underneath a rear floor via front and rear support parts, for storing a spare tire.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Storage structures for storing spare tires in the rear part of a vehicle body are known in the art, the structure disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2006-341642 (JP-A 2006-341642) being one example thereof.
 The storage structure comprises an undercover located at a predetermined distance underneath a rear floor, and a tire storage space for storing a spare tire is formed by the rear floor and the undercover.  An opening for accessing the spare tire
is formed in the undercover.  A winch is provided to the rear floor above the opening.  The spare tire is suspended by a tire holder provided to the bottom end of a chain of the winch.  The spare tire is stored in the tire storage space via the opening
while in a state of being suspended by the chain and the tire holder.  The bottom part of the tire holder is provided with a closing panel for closing off the opening.
 Thus, according to the storage structure described above, the spare tire is held in the tire holder, and winding the chain of the winch raises the tire holder and closing panel.  The closing panel rises and thereby closes the opening, whereby
the spare tire is stored in the tire storage container.
 The tire holder and the closing panel are lowered by unwinding the chain of the winch, and the spare tire in the tire storage space can be taken out from below the undercover (i.e. out of the vehicle) through the opening.  Taking the spare tire
out of the vehicle makes it possible to perform the task of replacing the spare tire.
 However, to store and remove the spare tire in the spare tire storage structure disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2006-341642, the winch must be wound and unwound, and the entire spare tire must be raised and lowered.  Thus,
when an attempt is made to raise or lower the entire spare tire, a large force is needed for the operation of winding or unwinding the chain, and the operations of storing and removing the spare tire are time-consuming.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle body rear part structure whereby a spare tire can be easily replaced in a vehicle body without excessive effort.
 According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a rear part structure of a vehicle body, which comprises a spare tire carrier which is comprised of a steel frame part, provided underneath a rear floor via front and rear
support parts, for storing a spare tire; and a tire cover, provided on the frame part, for covering a bottom part of the spare tire, wherein the tire cover has on an external surface an embedding groove recessed toward inside the tire cover, the frame
part being embedded in the embedding groove from outside the tire cover to thereby provide the tire cover to the frame part, and the frame part has front connecting parts rotatably connected to the front support parts, and a rear connecting part
vertically movably connected to the rear support part, so that vertical movements of the rear connecting part via the rear support part place the spare tire carrier in a tire storage position in which the spare tire is stored in position, and a tire
access position in which the spare tire is capable of being accessed.
 In the thus-arranged rear part structure, the front connecting parts of the frame part are rotatably connected to the front support parts, and the rear connecting part of the frame part is vertically movably connected to the rear support part. 
Raising and lowering the rear connecting part using the rear support part causes the spare tire carrier to be disposed in the tire storage position and the tire accessing position.  Consequently, the spare tire can be replaced merely by raising and
lowering only the rear connecting part of the frame part.  The operating force needed to replace the spare tire can thereby be minimized, and the spare tire can be easily replaced without excessive effort.
 Furthermore, the bottom part of the spare tire is covered by the tire cover, whereby the bottom part of the spare tire can be concealed by the tire cover.  Consequently, the bottom part of the spare tire can be lowered below the rear bumper so
that the bottom part of the spare tire is not visible from outside the vehicle (i.e., a favorable outward appearance is ensured).  The rear floor can thereby be lowered downward in accordance with the spare tire, and a large space in the rear cabin of
the vehicle can therefore be ensured.
 In addition, the embedding groove is formed in the tire cover, and the frame part is embedded in the embedding groove.  Consequently, the frame part can be prevented from protruding from the external surface of the tire cover, and the external
surface of the tire cover can be kept substantially flat.  Air currents can thereby flow smoothly along the external surface of the tire cover, aerodynamic performance can be improved, and fuel consumption performance can be improved.
 Preferably, the tire cover comprises: a metallic bottom front cover part for covering a bottom front part of the spare tire; and a resinous bottom rear cover part, extending in a direction away from the bottom front cover part rearwardly of the
vehicle body, for covering a region extending from behind a bottom front part to a bottom rear part of the spare tire.  With this arrangement, when the bottom front part of the spare tire falls toward the road surface due to a shock load acting on the
spare tire, the metal bottom front cover can come in contact with the road surface (the ground).  The metal bottom front cover can thereby slide along the road surface toward the front of the vehicle body together with the vehicle.  In other words, the
bottom front part of the spare tire can be prevented from coming in contact with the road surface (the ground), the spare tire can be prevented from bouncing back toward the rear of the vehicle body, and situations in which the rear of the vehicle body
(i.e. the rear floor) is affected by a bouncing spare tire can be prevented.
 Desirably, the embedding groove is defined by opposed side walls, each side wall having an interlocking projections protruding toward an interlocking projections of a companion side wall, and the frame part is held in the embedding groove by the
interlocking projections whereby the frame part is prevented from falling out.  By having these interlocking projections elastically deform, the frame part can pass over the interlocking projections and be led into the embedding groove.  The frame part
can thereby be readily embedded in the embedding groove without excessive effort.  Holding the frame part in the embedding groove using the interlocking projections also prevents the frame part from falling out.  There is accordingly no need to prepare a
holding-member in order to hold the frame part in the embedding groove, and the number of components can be minimized.
 In a preferred form, the frame part comprises: front connecting parts rotatably connected to the front support parts; and an annular rear connecting part latched to a hook of the rear support part, the hook being vertically movably provided to
the rear support part, so that vertical movements of the hook via the rear support part place the annular rear connecting part in the tire storage position in which the spare tire is stored in position, and a tire access position in which the spare tire
is capable of being accessed.  Due to the rear connecting part being formed in an annular shape in this manner, there is no risk of the annular rear connecting part detaching (separating) from the hook even if a shock load is exerted on the spare tire
from the rear of the vehicle body.  Consequently, the annular rear connecting part can be preserved in its state of being latched to (engaged with) the hook.  The spare tire can thereby be prevented from falling off of the vehicle body (i.e., the spare
tire carrier).
 In a desired form, the tire cover comprises a metallic bottom front cover for covering a bottom front part of the spare tire.  With this arrangement, when the bottom front part of the spare tire falls toward the road surface due to a shock load
acting on the spare tire, the metal bottom front cover can come in contact with (be grounded on) the road surface.  The metal bottom front cover can thereby be permitted to slide along the road surface toward the front of the vehicle body together with
the vehicle.  In other words, the bottom front part of the spare tire can be prevented from coming in contact with (being grounded on) the road surface, the spare tire can be prevented from bouncing back toward the rear of the vehicle body, and
situations in which the rear of the vehicle body (i.e. the rear floor) is affected by a bouncing spare tire can be prevented.
 It is preferred that the vehicle body rear part structure further comprise a cross member extending below the rear floor and above the spare tire in a width direction of the vehicle body, and the cross member have a bottom part inclined
downwardly forwardly of the vehicle body, so that when a shock load is exerted on the spare tire from rearward of the vehicle body, the spare tire is guided downwardly forwardly of the vehicle body by the inclined bottom part of the cross member.  Thus,
when a shock load acts on the spare tire from the rear of the vehicle body, the spare tire can be guided at a downward slant toward the front of the vehicle body by the bottom part of the cross member.  The spare tire can be prevented from interfering
with the fuel system (e.g., the canister and other components) provided in proximity to the rear floor, and it is possible to ensure that the fuel system (the canister and other components) is not affected.
 Preferably, the rear support part comprises a cylindrical part with an internal thread formed in an internal peripheral surface thereof, and a shaft provided with an external thread capable of threaded engagement with the internal thread of the
cylindrical part, the cylindrical part being movable along the shaft by rotation of the shaft.  The shaft may have a stopper part at an end part thereof, the stopper part being provided with interlocking projections capable of interlocking with a concave
part formed on an external peripheral surface of the end part.  The interlocking projections may have external inclined parts formed to provide parts tapering in cross section, the tapering parts being in fitted engagement with an internal peripheral
surface of the cylindrical part, an end part of the cylindrical part being capable of coming in contact with the inclined parts to thereby prevent the cylindrical part from moving.  The cylindrical part can thus be prevented from moving toward the end
part of the shaft by the stopper part, and can also be prevented from falling off of (coming loose from) the end part of the shaft.
 It is preferred that the cylindrical part have a hook capable of suspending the spare tire carrier, so that the spare tire held in the spare tire carrier is stored below the rear floor via the hook.  Thus, when the spare tire carrier has been
latched to (engaged with) the hook, the shaft can be rotated to raise and lower the hook.  The hook can thereby be raised and lowered without excessive effort when the spare tire carrier has been latched to the hook, and operability can be simplified.
 Furthermore, the cylindrical part can be firmly held by the interlocking projections as a result of the internal peripheral surface of the cylindrical part fitting with the cross-sectional tapering parts of the interlocking projections and the
end part of the cylindrical part being brought into contact with the inclined parts of the interlocking projections.  Consequently, the cylindrical part can be prevented from falling off of (coming loose from) the end part of the shaft even when a
comparatively large load acts on the hook.  The spare tire (a comparatively heavy object) held in the spare tire carrier can thereby be suitably supported by the hook.
 It is preferred that the stopper part has a protector part for protecting the end part of the shaft.  With this arrangement, the spare tire carrier can be prevented by the protector from interfering with the shaft and the cylindrical part, and
the shaft and cylindrical part can be protected by the protector.  Furthermore, the stopper part can be easily mounted to the end part of the shaft without excessive effort by having the interlocking projections of the stopper part interlock with the
concave part of the shaft. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 Throughout the descriptions of the embodiments, the terms ""front,"" ""rear,"" ""left,"" and ""right"" represent directions as seen from a driver; front is indicated by Fr, rear by Rr, left by L, and right by R.
 (First Embodiment)
 A vehicle body rear part structure 10 comprises left and right rear side frames 12 extending in a vehicle body longitudinal direction, a rear floor 13 provided to the left and right rear side frames 12, a rear cross member 15 and rear panel 16
spanning between the left and right rear side frames 12, a rear bumper 17 provided on the vehicle-rear side of the rear panel 16, and carrier means 20 provided to the rear floor 13 and the rear panel 16, as shown in FIGS. 1 through 3.
 The left and right rear side frames 12 are disposed parallel to each other across a predetermined gap in the vehicle width direction, and the rear side frames 12 extend in the vehicle body longitudinal direction.
 The rear floor 13 is a floor panel provided to the left and right rear side frames 12.
 In the substantial center of the rear floor 13 there is formed a ledge 22 which bulges downward.  The ledge 22 has a floor bottom part 22a formed so as to slope downward toward the front of the vehicle body from the vicinity of the rear panel
16.
 In the front end vicinity of the floor bottom part 22a are formed left and right mounting seats 23 which bulge downward.
 The rear cross member 15 spans between center parts 12a in the substantial centers of the left and right rear side frames 12 in the vehicle body longitudinal direction, and extends in the vehicle width direction along the top surface 13a of the
rear floor 13.
 The rear cross member 15 is provided above the carrier means 20, and a member bottom part (bottom part) 15a is provided above a spare tire 25.
 The member bottom part 15a is inclined at a downward inclination angle .theta.1 toward the front of the vehicle body along the top part 25a of the spare tire 25.
 Consequently, when a shock load acts on the spare tire 25 from the rear of the vehicle body, the spare tire 25 can be guided by the member bottom part 15a in a downward incline toward the front of the vehicle body.
 The spare tire 25 can thereby be prevented from interfering with the fuel system (e.g., a canister 28 and other components) provided in proximity to the rear floor 13.  The reasons for forming the member bottom part 15a at a downward incline are
described in detail in FIG. 15.
 The spare tire 25 is supported by the carrier means 20 in a forward-inclined state having an inclination angle .theta.2 toward the front of the vehicle body.
 The inclination angle .theta.2 of the spare tire 25 and the inclination angle .theta.1 of the member bottom part 15a have the relationship .theta.1=.theta.2, or .theta.1.apprxeq..theta.2.
 The rear panel 16 spans between rear ends 12b of the left and right rear side frames 12.
 The rear bumper 17 is provided to the side of the rear panel 16 facing the rear of the vehicle body.
 The carrier means 20 comprises left and right front support parts (front support parts) 31 (see also FIG. 7) mounted to the left and right mounting seats 23 of the floor bottom part 22a, a rear support part (axial-direction movement device) 33
mounted to the right end 16a of the rear panel 16, and a spare tire carrier 35 provided to the left and right front support parts 31 and the rear support part 33.
 The left front support part 31 is mounted at the top end to the left mounting seat 23 by bolts 34, 34 (FIG. 7), and the left front support part 31 thereby protrudes downward from the left mounting seat 23.
 A support hole 32 is formed in the bottom end of the left front support part 31.  A left front connecting part 75a (described hereinafter) of the spare tire carrier 35 is connected to the support hole 32 of the left front support part 31.
 The right front support part 31 shown in FIG. 7 is a member bilaterally symmetrical with the left front support part 31, and is denoted by the same numerical symbol as the left front support part 31 and is not described.
 A right front connecting part 75b (described hereinafter) of the spare tire carrier 35 is connected to the support hole 32 of the right front support part 31.
 The rear support part 33 comprises a support boss 41 mounted to the right end 16a of the rear panel 16, a shaft 42 rotatably supported in a through-hole 41a of the support boss 41, a cylindrical part 44 threadedly fitted over the shaft 42, a
hook 45 provided to the cylindrical part 44, and a stopper part 46 provided to an end part 43 (see FIG. 6) of the shaft 42, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.  A rear connecting part 83 (described hereinafter) of the spare tire carrier 35 is connected to the
hook 45 of the rear support part 33.
 The support boss 41 is bonded to the right end 16a of the rear panel 16, and the through-hole 41a is disposed so as to be aligned in a vertical direction.
 The shaft 42 is rotatably supported in the through-hole 41a of the support boss 41, a nut 48 is integrally formed on the top of the shaft 42, a shaft concave part (concave part) 49 is formed in an annular fashion around the external peripheral
surface of the end part 43 shown in FIG. 6A, and an external thread 51 is formed on the external peripheral surface of the shaft 42 from a region 42a in proximity to the nut 48 to the shaft concave part 49.
 The shaft concave part 49 is formed into an annular concave shape consisting of a shaft bottom part 53, a top wall 54, and a bottom wall 55, as shown in FIG. 6A.
 The shaft bottom part 53 comprises a small-diameter bottom part 53a and an inclined bottom part 53b.  The inclined bottom part 53b is formed into an inclined shape so that the outside diameter gradually increases upward from the small-diameter
bottom part 53a.
 By forming the shaft concave part 49 in the end part 43 of the shaft 42, an interlocking edge part 57 is formed in the end edge of the end part 43.
 The cylindrical part 44 has an internal thread 62 formed in the internal peripheral surface 61, and a tapered part 63a is formed in a bottom end part (end part) 63 of the cylindrical part 44.  The internal thread 62 of the cylindrical part 44 is
threadably joined with the external thread 51 of the shaft 42.
 In this state, the nut 48 of the shaft 42 is operated with a work tool to rotate the shaft 42, whereby the cylindrical part 44 can be moved along the shaft 42.
 A top end 45a of the hook 45 is provided on the external peripheral wall of the cylindrical part 44, and a bottom end 45b is curved upward as shown in FIG. 5.
 Curving the bottom end 45b upward forms a hook 65 from which the spare tire carrier 35 (i.e., the annular rear connecting part 83) can be hung.
 In other words, the spare tire 25 placed in the spare tire carrier 35 can be stored with the hook 65.
 The stopper part 46 is a member made of resin and capable of interlocking with the interlocking edge part 57 of the end part 43, as shown in FIG. 6A.
 The stopper part 46 has a protector 67 for protecting the end part 43 of the shaft 42, and a plurality of interlocking projections 68 which protrude upward from the protector 67.
 The protector 67 is formed into an annular shape so as to cover the interlocking edge part 57 of the end part 43, and is a region with which the spare tire carrier 35 (the annular rear connecting part 83) shown in FIG. 5 can be in contact.  The
annular rear connecting part 83 can be prevented from interfering with the interlocking edge part 57 of the end part 43 by coming in contact with the protector 67.
 Consequently, the interlocking edge part 57 of the end part 43 (i.e., the rear support part 33) can be protected from the spare tire carrier 35 by the protector 67.
 The interlocking projections 68 are provided at equal intervals along the circumferential direction in the top part of the annular protector 67.
 At the bases of the interlocking projections 68, concave interlocking parts 68a are formed.  The concave interlocking parts 68a interlock with the bottom wall 55 of the shaft concave part 49, whereby the interlocking 68a projections 68 (i.e.,
the stopper part 46) are provided to the end part 43.
 In other words, the interlocking projections 68 are formed so as to be capable of interlocking with the shaft concave part 49.
 The interlocking projections 68 have inner inclined parts 68b formed above and inside of the concave interlocking parts 68a, and outer inclined parts (inclined parts) 68c formed on the outside, thereby forming cross-sectional tapering parts 69
which taper upward.
 When the cross-sectional tapering parts 69 have interlocked with the shaft concave part 49, the inner inclined parts 68b are disposed at a predetermined gap S1 from the inclined bottom part 53b of the shaft concave part 49.
 Furthermore, distal ends 69a of the cross-sectional tapering parts 69 are disposed in a state of facing (opposing) the top wall 54 of the shaft concave part 49.
 In this state, when the cylindrical part 44 has been lowered to the end part 43 of the shaft 42, the internal peripheral surface 61 of the cylindrical part 44 fits with the outer inclined parts 68c of the cross-sectional tapering parts 69, and
the tapered part (end parts) 63a of the cylindrical part 44 come in contact with the outer inclined parts 68c.
 The cylindrical part 44 can thereby be prevented from coming out of the end part 43 of the shaft 42 by the stopper part.
 The spare tire carrier 35 comprises a steel frame part 72 provided below the rear floor 13 (see FIG. 2) via the left and right front support parts 31 and the rear support part 33, and a tire cover 73 provided to the steel frame part 72, as shown

support hole 32 of the right front support part 31, and the upper half annular part 78 capable of latching (engaging) with the hook 65 of the rear support part 33.
 The upper half annular part 78 is formed in the right rear end of the main frame 75.
 The X frame 76 has a substantially V-shaped left frame 81 made of steel and obtained by bending a rod into a substantial V shape, and a substantially V-shaped right frame 82 made of steel and obtained by bending a rod into a substantial V shape,
wherein the substantial X shape is formed by the apex part 81a of the left substantially V-shaped frame 81 being joined to the apex part 82a of the right substantially V-shaped frame 82.
 In this X frame 76, a joining region 81b of the left substantially V-shaped frame 81 is joined to a left-side rod 75c of the main frame 75, and a joining region 82b of the right substantially V-shaped frame 82 is joined to a right-side rod 75d
of the main frame 75.
 The main frame 75 can thereby be reinforced by the X frame 76.
 The connecting frame 77 is a steel rod wherein a front end 77a is joined to the right-side rod 75d of the main frame 75, a rear end 77b is joined to the left-side rod 75c of the main frame 75, and a center part 77c is joined to the right
substantially V-shaped frame 82.
 The main frame 75 can thereby be reinforced by the connecting frame 77.
 The lower half annular frame 79 is a steel rod having a straight part 84 joined to a region 78a in the vicinity of the upper half annular part 78 of the main frame 75, and a lower half annular part 85 provided to the front end of the straight

 The lower half annular part 85 is formed into a concave shape protruding downward, and a front end 85a is joined to a front end part 78b of the upper half annular part 78.  The upper half annular part 78 is formed into a concave shape protruding
upward.
 The annular rear connecting part 83 is formed from the lower half annular part 85 and the upper half annular part 78.  The annular rear connecting part 83 is provided to the right-side rear end of the steel frame part 72, and the upper half
annular part 78 latches with the hook 65 of the rear support part 33.
 Thus, the rear connecting part 83 is formed into an annular shape, whereby the rear connecting part 83 can be prevented from separating from the hook 65.
 The reasons for forming the rear connecting part 83 into an annular shape are described in detail in FIGS. 15 and 16.
 The frame part 72 is mounted (provided) to the tire cover 73 by a plurality of mounting brackets 87, 88 and rivets 89 (see FIG. 9), as shown in FIG. 7.
 The tire cover 73 is a cover for covering the bottom part 25b (see FIG. 2) of the spare tire 25 while holding the spare tire 25 in a substantially transverse alignment (specifically, in a state of incline toward the front of the vehicle body).
 The tire cover 73 comprises a metal bottom front cover 91 for covering a bottom front part 25c (see FIG. 2) in the bottom part 25b of the spare tire 25, and a bottom rear cover 92 made of a resin and used for covering the remaining region 25d
(see FIG. 2) of the spare tire 25.
 The remaining region 25d of the spare tire 25 shown in FIG. 2 is the region extending from the rear of the bottom front part 25c to a bottom rear part 25e in the bottom part 25b of the spare tire 25, i.e., the region on the side of the bottom
front part 25c facing the rear of the vehicle body.
 The bottom rear cover 92 made from a resin is formed into a substantially rectangular shape in a plan view, and in the external surface 92a shown in FIG. 9A is formed an embedding groove (embedded concavity) 94 which is concave toward the inside
of the bottom rear cover 92.
 The frame part 72 is fitted into the embedding groove 94 from the outside of the tire cover 73 (the bottom rear cover 92), as shown in FIG. 9A.
 Having been fitted into the embedding groove 94, the frame part 72 (the apex part 81a of the left substantially V-shaped frame 81 and the apex part 82a of the right substantially V-shaped frame 82) is mounted (provided) to the bottom rear cover
92 by the mounting bracket 87 and the rivets 89, 89.
 The frame part 72 (the apex part 81a of the left substantially V-shaped frame 81 and the apex part 82a of the right substantially V-shaped frame 82) is thereby embedded into the embedding groove 94.
 By embedding the frame part 72 in the embedding groove 94, the frame part 72 can be concealed so as to not be visible from the outside of the vehicle body.
 Furthermore, by embedding the frame part 72 in the embedding groove 94, the frame part 72 can be prevented from protruding from the external surface 92a of the bottom rear cover 92, and the external surface 92a of the bottom rear cover 92 can be
ensured to be flat.
 By having the frame part 72 embedded in the embedding groove 94, the rod region 72a of the frame part 72 not embedded in the embedding groove 94 is fitted into a groove 95 in the bottom rear cover 92 as shown in FIG. 9B.
 The rod region 72a fitted into the groove 95 is mounted (provided) to the bottom rear cover 92 by the mounting bracket 88 and the rivets 89, 89.
 Thus, by fitting the rod region 72a into the groove 95, the rod region 72a can be prevented from protruding from the external surface 92a of the bottom rear cover 92, and the external surface 92a of the bottom rear cover 92 can be kept flat.
 In the metal bottom front cover 91 as shown in FIG. 7, the region 75e in the vicinity of the left front connecting part 75a of the main frame 75, the region 75f in the vicinity of the right front connecting part 75b of the main frame 75, a left
front end 76a of the X frame 76, and a right front end 76b of the X frame 76 are joined to an inside surface 91a of the bottom front cover 91.
 Consequently, the metal bottom front cover 91 is provided to the frame part 72 integrally with the bottom rear cover 92 made of resin.
 An external surface 91b of the metal bottom front cover 91 is disposed so as to be substantially coplanar with the external surface 92a of the resinous bottom rear cover 92 as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.
 In other words, the metal bottom front cover 91 and the bottom rear cover 92 made of a resin are integrally provided to the frame part 72.
 The bottom part 25b of the spare tire 25 supported by the frame part 72 can thereby be covered by the bottom front cover 91 and the bottom rear cover 92 (i.e. the tire cover 73).
 By covering the bottom part 25b of the spare tire 25 with the tire cover 73 in this manner, the bottom part 25b of the spare tire 25 can be concealed by the tire cover 73.
 Consequently, the bottom part 25b of the spare tire 25 can be lowered below the rear bumper 17 so that the bottom part 25b of the spare tire 25 cannot be seen from outside the vehicle (i.e., in a state of ensuring a favorable outward
appearance).
 Specifically, a rear end 73a of the tire cover 73 is disposed at substantially the same height as a bottom part 17a of the rear bumper 17, and the tire cover 73 is inclined in a forward incline having an inclination angle .theta.2 toward the
front of the vehicle body.
 Consequently, the height of a front end 73b of the tire cover 73 can be lowered to a height H1 below the bottom part 17a of the rear bumper 17.
 In other words, the tire cover 73 (the bottom part 25b of the spare tire 25) can be lowered below the rear bumper 17.
 The floor bottom part 22a of the rear floor 13 can thereby be lowered in accordance with the spare tire 25, and a large rear cabin space 97 in the vehicle can therefore be ensured.
 In addition, the embedding groove 94 is formed in the bottom rear cover 92, and the frame part 72 is embedded in the embedding groove 94 as shown in FIG. 9A.
 Consequently, the frame part 72 can be prevented from protruding beyond the external surface 73c of the tire cover 73, and the external surface 73c of the tire cover 73 can be kept substantially flat, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.
 Air currents can thereby flow smoothly along the external surface 73c of the tire cover 73, aerodynamic performance can be improved, and fuel consumption performance can be improved.
 The metal bottom front cover 91 is a cover for covering the bottom front part 25c of the spare tire 25 in a state in which the spare tire 25 is disposed in a substantially transverse alignment (i.e., in a forward incline having an inclination
angle .theta.2 toward the front of the vehicle body) as shown in FIG. 2.
 Consequently, when the bottom front part 25c of the spare tire 25 falls toward the road surface 101 (see FIG. 16B) due to a shock load acting on the spare tire 25, the metal bottom front cover 91 can be brought in contact with the road surface
101 (the ground).
 The bottom front cover 91 is covered by a metal cover, and is thereby capable of sliding with the vehicle toward the front of the vehicle body along the road surface 101.
 The reasons for covering the bottom front cover 91 with a metal cover are described in detail using FIG. 16.
 The annular rear connecting part 83 of the spare tire carrier 35 latches with the hook 65, whereby the spare tire 25 is held in a substantially transverse alignment by the spare tire carrier 35.
 The spare tire 25 is thereby stored in a forward-inclined storage position having an inclination angle .theta.2 toward the front of the vehicle body.
 When the annular rear connecting part 83 has been latched to the hook 65, the nut 48 of the shaft 42 shown in FIG. 7 can be operated by a work tool to turn the shaft 42.
 Turning the shaft 42 allows the hook 65 to be raised and lowered (moved vertically) together with the cylindrical part 44 without excessive effort.
 Raising and lowering the hook 65 (moving the hook vertically) allows the rear end 73a of the tire cover 73 to be easily raised and lowered in the direction of the arrows about the left and right front connecting parts 75a, 75b as an axis.
 The left and right front connecting parts 75a, 75b are rotatably supported on the left and right front support parts 31.
 Thus, the rear end 73a of the tire cover 73 is easily raised and lowered in the direction of the arrows, whereby the ease of operation can be improved when the rear end 73a of the tire cover 73 is raised and lowered.
 By raising and lowering the rear end 73a of the tire cover 73 in the direction of the arrows, the annular rear connecting part 83 (i.e., the spare tire carrier 35) can be placed in a tire storage position P1 and a tire accessing position P2 (see
FIG. 13B).
 The tire storage position P1 is a position in which the spare tire 25 can be stored.
 The tire accessing position P2 is a position in which the spare tire 25 can be replaced.
 Next, the procedure of mounting the stopper part 46 to the shaft 42 of the rear support part 33 will be described based on FIGS. 10A and 10B.
 The stopper part 46 is moved in the direction of arrow A toward the end part 43 of the shaft 42, as shown in FIG. 10A.
 The interlocking projections 68 of the stopper part 46 come in contact with the end part 43, and the interlocking projections 68 elastically deform in the directions of arrows B and widen outward.
 In this state, the stopper part 46 continuously moves in the direction of arrow A, and the interlocking projections 68 thereby pass over the interlocking edge part 57.
 By passing over the interlocking edge part 57, the interlocking projections 68 return to their original state indicated by arrows C, as shown in FIG. 10B.
 The interlocking projections 68 return to their original state, the interlocking projections 68 fit into the shaft concave part 49, and the concave interlocking parts 68a of the interlocking projections 68 interlock with the bottom wall 55 of
the shaft concave part 49.
 The interlocking projections 68, i.e., the stopper part 46 can thereby be mounted on the end part 43 of the shaft 42.
 Causing the interlocking projections 68 to elastically deform and interlock with the shaft concave part 49 of the shaft 42 thus enables the stopper part 46 to be easily mounted to the end part 43 of the shaft 42 without excessive effort.
 Next, the procedure of removing the spare tire 25 from the spare tire carrier 35 is described based on FIGS. 11 to 13.
 The left and right front connecting parts 75a, 75b of the spare tire carrier 35 are rotatably connected to the left and right front support parts 31 as shown in FIG. 11A.
 The annular rear connecting part 83 of the spare tire carrier 35 is latched to the rear support part 33 (specifically, to the hook 65).  The hook 65 (the annular rear connecting part 83) is disposed in the tire storage position P1.
 In this state, the spare tire 25 is stored in the spare tire carrier 35 while being disposed in a substantially transverse alignment (specifically, in a forward incline having an inclination angle .theta.2 toward the front of the vehicle body).
 With the annular rear connecting part 83 latched to the hook 65 as shown in FIG. 11B, the nut 48 of the shaft 42 is turned as indicated by arrow D.
 The rotation of the shaft 42 causes the cylindrical part 44 together with the hook 65 to descend as indicated by arrow E.
 Returning to FIG. 11A, the lowering of the hook 65 as indicated by arrow E causes the rear end 73a of the tire cover 73 to descend as indicated by arrow F about the left and right front connecting parts 75a, 75b as an axis.
 The lowering of the cylindrical part 44 to the end part 43 of the shaft 42 causes the hook 65 (the annular rear connecting part 83) to be disposed in the tire accessing position P2 as shown in FIG. 12.
 When the cylindrical part 44 has been lowered to the end part 43 of the shaft 42 as shown in FIG. 13A, the internal peripheral surface 61 of the cylindrical part 44 fits with the outer inclined parts 68c of the cross-sectional tapering parts 69.
 The cross-sectional tapering parts 69 elastically deform as indicated by arrows G and come in contact with the shaft bottom part 53 of the shaft concave part 49.
 In this state, the tapered part 63a of the cylindrical part 44 comes in contact with the outer inclined parts 68c of the cross-sectional tapering parts 69, whereby the tapered part 63a digs into the cross-sectional tapering parts 69.
 Having the tapered part 63a dig into the cross-sectional tapering parts 69 enables the cylindrical part 44 to be firmly held in place by the interlocking projections 68, even using the stopper part 46 made of resin.
 The stopper part 46 can be made of a resin, the manufacture of the stopper part 46 can be simplified, and costs can be minimized.
 Thus, having the cylindrical part 44 held securely in place by the interlocking projections 68 enables the cylindrical part 44 to be kept from falling off of (coming loose from) the end part 43 of the shaft 42 even when a comparatively large
downward force is exerted on the hook 65.
 The spare tire 25 (a comparatively heavy object) held in the spare tire carrier 35 can thereby be suitably supported by the rear support part 33.
 Having the hook 65 (the annular rear connecting part 83) disposed in the tire accessing position P2 as shown in FIG. 13B causes the rear end 73a of the tire cover 73 to be lowered by a distance H2 from the bottom part 17a of the rear bumper 17.
 Consequently, a space 103 is provided between the bottom part 17a of the rear bumper 17 and the rear end 73a of the tire cover 73, and this space 103 is used to insert or remove the spare tire 25.
 When a spare tire 25 is to be stored in the spare tire carrier 35, the procedure described in FIGS. 11 to 13 is performed in reverse.
 The left and right front connecting parts 75a, 75b are rotatably connected to the left and right front support parts 31, and the annular rear connecting part 83 is latched (engaged) to the hook 65 as described in FIGS. 11 to 13.
 Consequently, the rear end 73a of the tire cover 73 can be raised and lowered to cause the tire cover 73 to be disposed in the tire storage position P1 and the tire accessing position P2.
 The spare tire 25 can thereby be replaced merely by raising and lowering only the rear end 73a of the tire cover 73.
 Therefore, the operating force needed in cases of replacing the spare tire 25 can be minimized, and the spare tire 25 can be easily replaced without excessive effort.
 The following is a description, made with reference to FIGS. 9A and 14, of an example in which air currents flow smoothly over the spare tire carrier 35.
 The embedding groove 94 is formed in the bottom rear cover 92, and the frame part 72 is embedded in the embedding groove 94 as shown in FIG. 9A.
 The frame part 72 can be prevented from protruding beyond the external surface 73c of the tire cover 73, and the external surface 73c of the tire cover 73 can be kept substantially flat, as shown in FIG. 14.
 When the tire cover 73 is disposed in the tire storage position P1, air currents can thereby flow smoothly along the external surface 73c of the tire cover 73 as indicated by arrows I, aerodynamic performance can be improved, and fuel
consumption performance can be improved.
 The following is a description, made with reference to FIGS. 15 and 16, of an example of a shock load acting on the spare tire 25 from the rear of the vehicle body.
 For example, a shock load F1 acts on the spare tire 25 from the rear of the vehicle 100 while the vehicle 100 is traveling, as shown in FIG. 15A.
 The member bottom part 15a of the rear cross member 15 herein is formed at an incline having an inclination angle .theta.1 (FIG. 2) along the top part 25a of the spare tire 25.
 Consequently, when the shock load F1 acts on the spare tire 25, the spare tire 25 can be guided by the member bottom part 15a at a downward slope toward the front of the vehicle body, as indicated by arrow J.
 The spare tire 25 can thereby be prevented from interfering with the fuel system (e.g., the canister 28 and other components) provided in proximity to the rear floor 13, and it is possible to ensure that the fuel system (e.g., the canister 28
and other components) will not be affected.
 The spare tire 25 moves as indicated by arrow J, whereby the annular rear connecting part 83 also moves as indicated by arrow J as shown in FIG. 15B.  The annular rear connecting part 83 is latched to (engaged with) to the hook 65.
 Consequently, the movement of the right substantially V-shaped frame 82 causes the rear support part 33 to swingably move about the support boss 41 as a fulcrum, as indicated by arrow K.
 The rear connecting part 83 is formed into an annular shape by the lower half annular part 85 and the upper half annular part 78 as shown in FIG. 16A.
 Consequently, when the annular rear connecting part 83 has moved as indicated by arrow J and the rear support part 33 has swingably moved as indicated by arrow K, there is no danger of the annular rear connecting part 83 detaching (separating)
from the hook 65.
 Consequently, the annular rear connecting part 83 can be preserved in its state of being latched to (engaged with) the hook 65.
 The spare tire 25 can thereby be prevented from falling off of the vehicle body rear part structure 10 (i.e., the spare tire carrier 35).
 The spare tire 25 moving as indicated by arrow J causes the bottom front cover 91 to come in contact with the road surface 101 (the ground) as shown in FIG. 16B.  The bottom front cover 91 herein is a metal cover and is provided with rigidity.
 Thus, using a metal cover for the bottom front cover 91 and increasing rigidity enables the bottom front cover 91 to slide along the road surface 101 as indicated by arrow L toward the front of the vehicle body together with the vehicle 100.
 In other words, the bottom front part 25c of the spare tire 25 can be prevented from coming in contact with the road surface 101 (the ground), and the spare tire 25 can be prevented from bouncing back toward the rear of the vehicle body.
 As a consequence thereof, it is possible to prevent situations in which the rear of the vehicle body (specifically, the rear floor) is affected by a bouncing spare tire 25.
 (Second Embodiment)
 Next, a spare tire carrier 110 according to the second embodiment will be described.
 The spare tire carrier 110 according to the second embodiment is different in that the bottom rear cover 92 of the first embodiment is replaced by a bottom rear cover 112 as shown in FIG. 17, and the configuration is otherwise identical to the
spare tire carrier 35 of the first embodiment.
 In the bottom rear cover 112, an embedding groove (embedding concavity) 114 which concaves toward the inside of the bottom rear cover 112 is formed in the external surface 112a as shown in FIGS. 18 to 20, and the configuration is otherwise
identical to the bottom rear cover 92 of the first embodiment.
 The frame part 72 is fitted into the embedding groove 114 from the outside of the bottom rear cover 112.
 One interlocking projection (an interlocking projection) 117 protrudes from one side wall (a side wall) 115 of the embedding groove 114 toward the other opposing side wall (a side wall) 116.
 Another interlocking projection (an interlocking projection) 118 also protrudes from the other side wall (a side wall) 116 of the embedding groove 114 toward the opposing first side wall (a side wall) 115.
 A plurality of openings 119 is formed in a bottom part 114a of the embedding groove 114 as shown in FIGS. 17 and 19 through 21.
 The openings 119 are openings needed in order to receive the forming die when the first interlocking projection 117 and the second interlocking projection 118 are formed.
 The first interlocking projection 117 and the second interlocking projection 118 are made to protrude (jut) so as to face each other across a predetermined gap S2.
 Consequently, the frame part 72 is held inside the embedding groove 114 by the first interlocking projection 117 and the second interlocking projection 118, whereby the frame part 72 can be prevented from falling out.
 The following is a description, made with reference to FIGS. 21A and 21B, of the procedure of embedding the frame part 72 in the embedding groove 114.
 The frame part 72 is inserted into the embedding groove 114 as indicated by arrow M, as shown in FIG. 21A.
 The frame part 72 comes in contact with the first interlocking projection 117 and the second interlocking projections118, and the first interlocking projection 117 and second interlocking projection 118 elastically deform as indicated by arrows
N.
 The frame part 72 surmounts the first interlocking projection 117 and the second interlocking projection 118 and fits into the embedding groove 114 as shown in FIG. 21B.
 The frame part 72 separates from the first interlocking projection 117 and the second interlocking projection 118, and the first interlocking projection 117 and second interlocking projection 118 return to their original state as indicated by
arrows O.
 The frame part 72 can thereby be held in a state of being embedded in the embedding groove 114 by the first interlocking projection 117 and the second interlocking projection 118.
 The frame part 72 can thereby be easily embedded in the embedding groove 114 without excessive effort.
 Furthermore, by holding the frame part 72 in the embedding groove 114 by the first interlocking projection 117 and the second interlocking projection 118, the frame part 72 can be prevented from falling out.
 A holding-designated member is thereby not needed in order to hold the frame part 72 in the embedding groove 114, and the number of components can be minimized.
 For example, the mounting brackets 87, 88 and the rivets 89 (see FIG. 9) were needed as holding-designated members in the first embodiment, but these members can be omitted.
 It is accordingly possible to lower the cost, reduce the number of assembly steps, and lessen the weight.
 Additionally, with the spare tire carrier 110 of the second embodiment, the same effects can be obtained as with the spare tire carrier 35 of the first embodiment.
 The vehicle body rear part structure 10 according to the present invention is not limited to the first and second embodiments previously described, and can be changed improved, or otherwise modified as is appropriate.
 For example, in the first and second embodiments, examples are given in which the rear support part 33 was mounted to the right end 16a of the rear panel 16 and the annular rear connecting part 83 was provided to the right rear end of the frame
part 72, but the present invention is not limited to these examples, and other possibilities include providing the rear support part 33 and the annular rear connecting part 83 to the left side or providing them to both the left and right sides.
 The shapes and configurations of the rear floor 13, the spare tire 25, the left and right front support parts 31, the rear support part 33, the spare tire carrier 35, the frame part 72, the tire cover 73, the external surface 73c of the tire
cover, the left front connecting part 75a, the right front connecting part 75b, the annular rear connecting part 83, the metal bottom front cover 91, the bottom rear cover 92 made of a resin, the embedding grooves 94 and 114, the first side wall 115, the
second side wall 116, the first interlocking projection 117, the second interlocking projection 118, and other components shown in the first and second embodiments are not limited to those given by way of example and can be changed as is appropriate.
 The vehicle body rear part structure of the present invention is suitable for application in an automobile in which a steel frame is provided underneath a rear floor, and a spare tire carrier is provided for storing a spare tire using the frame.
 Obviously, various minor changes and modifications of the present invention are possible in light of the above teaching.  It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than
as specifically described.

 This application claims priority to German Patent Application No. 102010008256.2, filed Feb.  17, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
 The technical field relates to a handle, and more particularly to a handle for a motor vehicle.
BACKGROUND
 A handle, particularly for a motor vehicle, is provided with a frame surrounding an upper part.  At least one engagement hook is arranged on the frame, which can be engaged in at least one opening and/or on at least one projection of the upper
part.
 The handle can, for example, be provided in a trunk floor of a combination vehicle in order to lift the floor.  With a force approximately acting in a concentrated manner, for example, by one person kneeling in the trunk and in the process
pressing on the handle with his/her knee it can happen that the engagement hook is inadvertently released from its engagement and the handle thus more or less falls apart.
 DE 78 13 898 U1 describes a device with which two components, particularly an armrest, can be connected to a side wall part of a motor vehicle by means of an engagement connection.  For this purpose, an engagement hook is secured by means of a
bolt to be arranged transversely to said engagement hook.  However, this safeguard cannot be applied to the handle mentioned at the outset for solving the above-mentioned problem.
 In view of the foregoing, it is at least one object to improve the handle mentioned at the outset so that the engagement hook always remains reliably engaged.  In addition, other objects, desirable features and characteristics will become
apparent from the subsequent summary and detailed description, and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background.
SUMMARY
 A handle, particularly for a motor vehicle, is provided with a frame surrounding an upper part.  At least one engagement hook is arranged on the frame, which can be hooked into at least one corresponding counterpart provided on the upper part,
and with a lower part to be arranged on the upper part, on which at least one projection that can be placed against the engagement hook is provided.  Through the projection placed against the engagement hook the engagement hook can no longer be pushed
out of its engaged position so that it remains reliably engaged even when a major force acts on the handle.  A function of the projection is at a maximum when it is abuts the free end of the engagement hook as closely as possible.  In one embodiment the
at least one projection can be embodied as a web.
 The lower part can be fastened to the upper part with at least one engagement hook.  In this manner, additional fastening means such as for example screws and the like can be omitted, as a result of which the assembly can be performed more
easily and more quickly.  The handle can be integrated in a break-through of a trunk floor of a combination vehicle.  Thus the trunk floor can be folded over with the handle in order to get to a concealed stowage space.  The trunk floor can be designed
as a plate-shaped object or as a mat.  On the lower part a handle element can be arranged.  With the handle element the folded-over trunk floor can be folded back again.
 The handle element can be realized particularly easily if it is designed as a break-through provided in the lower part.  However, in an alternative configuration the handle element can also be designed eye-shaped or hook-shaped.  The
break-through can be adjoined by a depression that can be reached into by the tips of the fingers in order to be able to better fold back the folded-over trunk floor.
 On the upper part, a lid, for example with a pin-shaped hinge, can be articulated.  The lid closes an interior space of the handle.  The lid can be at least approximately flush with the surface of the trunk floor.  Because of this, an attractive
design is achieved so that the handle is hardly noticed especially if it has a same or similar color as the trunk floor.  Through the articulation the lid can be pivoted in the direction of the lower part if one wishes to use the handle in order to fold
over the trunk floor.  For this purpose one simply presses against the lid with the finger tips and subsequently reaches behind the upper part in order to pull it.  The lid can be pushed against the upper part with a spring element so that it closes the
interior space of the handle when the handle is not operated.
 In a region located opposite its articulation the lid can have a buffer element which prevents that the lid strikes against the upper part.  In this manner, interfering rattling noises can be avoided.  The at least one counterpart provided on
the upper part can comprise an opening and/or a projection into which the engagement hook can be reliably hooked.
 A motor vehicle is also provided having a handle as previously and subsequently described. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
 The present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the following drawing figures, wherein like numerals denote like elements, and;
 FIG. 1 is a perspective exploded representation of the handle.
 FIG. 2 a perspective top view of the handle from FIG. 1.  and
 FIG. 3 a sectional view through the handle from FIG. 2.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit application and uses.  Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background or summary or the following
detailed description.
 FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 show a handle 10 with a lid 11, a frame 12, an upper part 13 and a lower part 14.  For assembly, the lid 11 is inserted in the upper part 13 from the top.  This unit preassembled so far is inserted from the bottom in a
break-through which is not shown in more detail of a trunk floor which is likewise not shown.  After this, the frame 12 is placed on the upper part 13 from the top and engaged in said upper part.  The engagement is ensured by engagement hooks 15 which
engage in openings 16 provided for this purpose.  Finally, the lower part 14 is pressed against the upper part 13 from below.  By means of engagement hooks 17 and 18 which engage in openings 19 and 20 the upper part 13 and the lower part 14 are fastened
to each other.
 FIG. 3 shows the finish-assembled handle 10 which is integrated in the trunk floor 30.  Projections 31 abut the engagement hooks 15.  When a force acts on the handle 10 from above said force pushes the handle 10 downwards so that the engagement
hooks 15 would be bent to the outside if the projections 31 were not present.  Consequently the projections 31 ensure that the engagement hooks 15 remain engaged in the upper part 13 when the force acts on the handle 10 from above.
 The lid 11 is articulated on the upper part 13 with an articulation 32 that can be a pin.  A spring element 33 presses the lid 11 against the upper part 13.  A buffer element 34 is arranged between the lid 11 and the upper part 13 in order to
avoid rattling noises.
 With the handle 10 the trunk floor 30 can be folded over upwards.  For this purpose, one presses the lid 11 down with the tips of the fingers so that said lid is pivoted to the right.  After this, one can reach behind the upper part 13, pulling
it upwards.
 In the lower part 14 a handle element 35 designed as break-through is provided (see also FIG. 1).  If one wishes to fold the trunk floor 30 back again, one simply reaches into the break-through and pulls the trunk floor 30 back again.  In order
to improve the handling when pulling back a depression 100 (see FIG. 1) into which one can reach with the finger tips adjoins the break-through 35.
 While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing summary and detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist.  It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or
exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration in any way.  Rather, the foregoing summary and detailed description will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for
implementing an exemplary embodiment, it being understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements described in an exemplary embodiment without departing from the scope as set forth in the appended claims and their
legal equivalents.

 The present disclosure relates generally to vehicle interior coverings and, more particularly, to vehicle interior coverings that include decorative stitching.
BACKGROUND
 Vehicle interiors utilize various types of decorative components to provide a desired aesthetic.  Certain types of materials and components, such as leather or genuine wood trim, may traditionally provide a vehicle interior with a luxurious feel
because the cost of such materials is usually high, making them affordable only to purchasers of expensive vehicles.  One distinctive feature of leather trim materials is what may be termed a ""cut-and-sew"" look, where pieces of leather material are
hand-sewn together, often with decorative stitching, to form a covering to fit the contours of various types of interior components.  Some efforts have been made to simulate such a hand-sewn look to make it more affordable for use in less expensive
vehicles.
 U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,922,956 to Scheidmantel et al. describes one technique that purports to simulate a cut-and-sew look.  The method taught by Scheidmantel includes molding a component from a plastic material using a mold that has the shape of a
simulated sewn joint formed in the mold surface.  When removed from the mold, the molded component includes a molded-in simulated sewn joint in the form of a pair of ridges with an indentation between the ridges.  Scheidmantel teaches adding a
thread-stitched seam parallel to the ridges to simulate a sewn joint.
SUMMARY
 According to one embodiment, a vehicle interior component is provided that includes a substrate having an outer surface, a decorative covering, a seam formed in the decorative covering, and an elongated seam spacer located between the substrate
outer surface and the decorative covering.  The decorative covering is disposed over the substrate outer surface, and the seam includes a line of decorative stitching sewn through the covering along a stitch path.  The seam spacer is arranged along the
stitch path so that it supports the covering directly beneath at least a portion of the line of decorative stitching.
 In another embodiment, the decorative covering includes a reduced thickness portion along the stitch path, and at least a portion of the seam spacer is located at the reduced thickness portion.
 In another embodiment, the decorative covering includes a decorative skin layer and an inner layer.  The inner layer includes a reduced thickness portion along the stitch path, and at least a portion of the seam spacer is located at the reduced

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)
 The following description is directed at various embodiments of vehicle interior components that include decorative stitching and structures and methods for ensuring that the decorative stitching, typically included as a desirable aesthetic
feature of such components, does not cause other undesirable aesthetic defects therein.  Seam spacers may be used with decorative coverings to support such coverings over a substrate at reduced thickness portions in the coverings that may coincide with
the location of the decorative stitching.  These seam spacers can help prevent local sagging or sinking of the covering at the reduced thickness portions and/or they can be used to form bulges or raised areas in the coverings to help simulate a fold in
the covering as part of a simulated seam.
 Referring to FIG. 1, a vehicle interior is shown to illustrate various examples of vehicle interior components that may include coverings with decorative stitching.  Instrument panel assembly 12, seat assembly 14, console assembly 16, and door
panel assembly 18 may all include decorative coverings disposed over and/or attached to their respective component substrates.  The arrows in the figure also point to example locations for seams and/or decorative stitching for each of the components. 
The coverings and seam spacers disclosed herein may be used with any other interior component as well, such as steering wheel assemblies, shifter assemblies, etc.
 FIG. 2 is an enlarged view of a portion of the instrument panel assembly 12 of FIG. 1.  The illustrated instrument panel 12 includes one or more seams 20, as shown.  Seam 20 may be a functional seam where two portions of covering material are
attached to each other, it may be a simulated seam where one or more line(s) of decorative stitching 24 are provided either alone or in combination with other features that simulate a seam, or it may be a functional seam that includes decorative
stitching 24.  Examples of different types of seams 20 will be detailed below.
 Referring now to FIG. 3, a cross-sectional view of one example of a vehicle interior component 10 is shown with a simulated seam 20 and decorative stitching 24 formed therein.  Component 10 includes a substrate 26, a decorative covering 28
disposed over the substrate, and a seam spacer 30 located between the substrate and the covering.  The substrate 26 forms the overall three-dimensional shape of the particular vehicle interior component and includes an outer surface 32.  In the case of
an instrument panel, the substrate 26 is at least partly structural in nature in that it supports and/or provides attachment locations for other vehicle components, like HVAC components, airbag components, etc. It can be formed from any suitable material
such as filled or unfilled plastics, metals, or combinations thereof.  In one embodiment, substrate 26 is constructed from a material that includes a thermoplastic olefinic material such as polypropylene, and may be reinforced with 20-30% glass fiber. 
The substrate 26 thickness may range from about 2.0 mm to about 4.0 mm where plastic materials are used in its construction.  Outer surface 32 may be generally smooth and continuous with the exception of openings or other functional features.  In one
embodiment, the substrate does not include any standing or proud features such as ribs or bosses along the outer surface at or near the seam 20.
 Decorative covering 28 overlies the substrate 26 to provide a desired aesthetic and may be attached to the substrate with a suitable adhesive or by other means.  Covering 28 includes an outer surface 34 and an opposite inner surface 36 that
faces the substrate outer surface 32 as shown.  At least a portion of inner surface 36 is in contact with the substrate outer surface 32.  In this particular embodiment, covering 28 includes a decorative skin layer 38 and an inner layer 40 sandwiched
between the skin layer 38 and the substrate 26.  In the bi-layer construction shown, the skin layer 38 includes the covering outer surface 34, and the inner layer 40 includes the covering inner surface 36.  In other embodiments, covering 28 may be formed
from a single layer of material or may include one or more additional layers between the skin and inner layers 38, 40.
 Skin layer 38 is generally decorative and may be constructed from a pliable material such as those typically used in vehicle interiors, including TPO, TPE, PVC, PUR, leather, simulated leather, or other types.  Material selection may be based on
a number of factors, including the desired type of texture for outer surface 34, the tactile feel of the material, cost, processability, or others.  Inner layer 40 may be constructed from a compressible foam material to provide a cushioned feel to the
covering 28 and to the vehicle component 10.  Examples of foam materials for inner layer 40 include polyolefin-based foam, polyurethane foam, acrylic-based foam, or polyester foam, to name a few.  Other non-foam materials such as felt or textile fibers
may be used as well.  Layers 38 and 40 may be initially provided as separate unattached layers for assembly to substrate 26, or they may be co-extruded, laminated, adhesively bonded or otherwise attached to each other to form covering 28 separately from
substrate 26.
 Individual layer thicknesses may vary, but the overall nominal thickness of covering 28 may range from about 0.2 mm to about 6 mm, in accordance with the individual layer thicknesses, and preferably ranges from about 1.0 mm to about 4.0 mm.  The
thickness of skin layer 38 may range from about 0.2 mm to about 1.0 mm, and preferably ranges from about 0.3 mm to about 0.7 mm.  The selected skin layer thickness depends on several variables such as material type, manufacturability, and desired
aesthetic, to name a few.  The thickness of inner layer 40 may range from about 0.5 mm up to about 5.0 mm or higher, depending on the desired tactile feel of the interior vehicle component.  In one embodiment, covering 28 has an overall thickness of
about 2.0 mm, where the skin layer 38 is about 1.0 mm thick and the inner layer 40 is about 1.0 mm thick.  In another embodiment, the skin layer is about 0.5 mm thick, and the inner layer is about 3.5 mm thick, so that the overall covering thickness is
4.0 mm.  Of course, these are non-limiting examples, as there are several suitable combinations of layer thicknesses.  These example ranges are nominal ranges, as some covering features can locally affect covering thickness.
 Seam 20 is formed in covering 28 so that it is visible from the interior of the vehicle.  Seam 20 may be a functional seam where two separate portions of a covering are attached together, or it may be a simulated seam.  The particular seam 20
shown in FIG. 3 is a simulated seam that includes a line of decorative stitching 24 along a stitch path 42, represented in FIG. 3 by a dashed line at the cross-section.  The stitch path 42 represents the location of the line of decorative stitching along
and through the opposite surfaces 34, 36 of the covering 28, which may be a pre-determined location.  The stitch path 42 and corresponding line of decorative stitching can be in any curvilinear shape along the covering surfaces--i.e., the term ""line"" is
not meant to limit the shape of the stitch path 42 to a straight line.  Skilled artisans will recognize that the line of decorative stitching comprises multiple interconnected loops of thread that pass through the covering 28 along the stitch path 42. 
The portion of the covering 28 that lies along the stitch path may be at least partially compressed by these loops of thread during the sewing operation as the sewing equipment maintains proper thread tension.  As shown in FIG. 3, a reduced thickness
portion 44 of the covering 28 may result.  This may particularly be the case where the covering includes a compressible foam inner layer 40.  Reduced thickness portion 44 is reduced in thickness relative to the nominal covering thickness and generally
lies along the stitch path 42.
 Seam spacer 30 is a piece of material that is arranged along the stitch path between the substrate and the decorative covering that helps to support the covering directly beneath at least a portion of the line of decorative stitching.  Spacer 30
may be provided to account for at least a portion of the difference in the nominal thickness of the covering 28 and the reduced thickness at portion 44.  The seam spacer 30 may have an elongated shape and/or have a generally uniform cross-section along
its length.  In the embodiment of FIG. 3, the seam spacer 30 includes a round cross-section, which can be circular, elliptical or otherwise round in shape.  In some cases, the seam spacer 30 is more compressible than the substrate but less compressible
than the covering.  Thus a seam spacer 30 having a circular cross-section before being placed between the covering and the substrate may assume an elliptical or flatter shape when assembled into the vehicle component 10.  Other seam spacer
cross-sectional shapes will be described in further detail in conjunction with other figures.
 Seam spacer 30 can be made from nearly any material that may be selected based on several factors such as relative compressibility, cost, ease of shaping it to follow the stitch path, desired attachment method when applicable, or other factors. 
For example, seam spacer compressibility may be tailored so that it sufficiently supports the covering directly beneath the reduced thickness portion of the covering, and so that the seam spacer ""gives"" when pressed on.  A material that compresses more
than another material under the same load has a higher relative compressibility than the other material.  The overall desired effect may be that a simulated seam 20 feels like a functional seam because when pressed by hand, the seam 20 feels as if an
edge of material is folded under itself at the seam.  Textile materials are one type of material suitable for use as seam spacers 30.  Textile materials include but are not limited to any interlaced, woven, or pressed strands of natural or synthetic
fibers such as cotton, wool, polyester, nylon, acrylic, etc. Other suitable seam spacer materials include synthetic foam materials, semi-rigid plastics, elastomers, or certain metals in some cases.  The seam spacer 30 can also include more than one type
of material, such as a plastic portion attached to a felt portion, for example.
 Seam spacer 30 may be attached to the covering 28, prior to the covering being disposed over the substrate 26, using any suitable technique sufficient to hold the spacer 30 in place until the component 10 is assembled.  In one embodiment, the
seam spacer 30 is sewn onto covering 28 at inner surface 36 so that at least a portion of the seam spacer 30 lies along the stitch path 42.  In one particular embodiment, the decorative stitching 24 attaches the seam spacer 30 to the covering 28.  In
that case, decorative stitching 24 is partly functional, in that the lower end of the stitching passes through the seam spacer to attach it to the inner surface 36 of the covering 28, though still not part of a functional seam (in which two separate
portions of covering material are joined).  Seam spacers formed from textile materials may be particularly suitable in embodiments in which the seam spacer 30 is sewn to the covering, as textiles may be typically compatible with sewing equipment.  Of
course, other types of seam spacer materials can be attached to the covering by sewing.  The seam spacer can be attached to the covering by other means as well, such as adhesive, hook and loop fasteners, melt bonding, separate fastening elements,
frictional fit, etc. In one embodiment, the seam spacer 30 is adhesively attached to the covering and may be provided as a peel-and-stick element.
 FIG. 4 illustrates an example of a vehicle component 10 that includes a simulated seam 20 with a slightly different configuration.  The example of FIG. 4 is similar to that of FIG. 3, with one difference being that the seam spacer 30' has a
larger cross-section than that of the seam spacer 30 of FIG. 3.  The seam spacer 30' is configured so that it accounts for the reduced thickness portion 44 of the covering and includes additional thickness, thus creating a raised feature or visible ridge
46 as part of seam 20.  Ridge 46 may help simulated seam 20 appear more like a functional seam, as functional seams often have edges of joined material folded under the material at the seam, resulting in a similar bulge or ridge along the seam.  In one
embodiment, the seam spacer may be located along the inner surface of the covering along a stitch path that does not have a corresponding reduced thickness portion, either because the inner layer is not compressible, or for other reasons.  In such an
embodiment, the seam spacer may be provided to help form or shape a ridge in the finished component.
 In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 5, the vehicle component 10 includes a simulated ridge seam 20.  This type of simulated seam can appear as if one portion of material has an edge folded under and sewn over the top of an edge of an adjacent
portion of material.  This embodiment includes a pre-formed ridge 46' that may be formed in the covering 28 generally parallel to the pre-determined stitch path 42 prior to the covering 28 being disposed over the substrate 26.  Ridge 46' is an upstanding
or proud ridge and may be a more distinct or more sharply defined feature than the more subtle ridge 46 of FIG. 4.  Ridge 46' can be formed in thermoplastic or other thermoformable covering materials by a thermoforming process, some examples of which
will be described below.
 In this embodiment, seam spacer 50, while having a uniform cross-section along its length, has a cross-section that is non-uniform in thickness and non-symmetric with respect to the stitch path 42.  In this example, main portion 52 of spacer 50
that lies along the stitch path 42 is thicker than auxiliary portion 54 that extends away from the stitch path.  The cross-sectional shape of the seam spacer 50 may be tapered from thick to thin from main portion 52 toward auxiliary portion 54, or the
two portions may simply have two different thicknesses.  In the illustrated embodiment, the main portion 52 is the thickest portion of the seam spacer.  Other embodiments, including those shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, may also be arranged so that the thickest
portion of the seam spacer is located along the stitch path 42, but this is not necessarily always the case.  The amount of taper or the difference in the thickness from main portion 52 to auxiliary portion 54, along with the total width of the seam
spacer 50, may be used to tailor or modify the finished appearance of pre-formed ridge 46'.  For example, auxiliary portion 54 may have a thickness that is the same as or greater than the thickness of the main portion 52 to increase the prominence of the
ridge where it extends away from the stitch path 42 to simulate a greater amount of material overlap in the simulated seam 20 (shown as dashed lines in FIG. 5).  Auxiliary portion 54 may be provided for other reasons, such as for ease of handling a
narrower main portion 52 in a manufacturing environment.
 Example seam spacers are illustrated separately in FIGS. 6 and 7 and may be used with the embodiment of FIG. 5 or with other embodiments.  FIG. 6 shows one example of seam spacer 50 having a non-uniform thickness across its width.  In one
embodiment, seam spacer 50 is constructed from a textile material comprising woven fibers with a greater number of woven layers at the main portion 52 than at the auxiliary portion 54.  Other textile manufacturing techniques may be used to form a seam
spacer with a non-uniform thickness.  For example, a seam spacer having a non-uniform thickness such as seam spacer 50 could be formed from an elongated piece of material having a widthwise edge rolled or folded onto itself.  FIG. 7 illustrates an
example of a seam spacer 50' constructed in two pieces, where main portion 52' is separate piece, such as a plastic extrusion, that clips or slides onto an edge of auxiliary portion 54'.  Skilled artisans will appreciate the vast number of seam spacer
configurations that are possible in view of these teachings.
 Turning now to FIG. 8, the vehicle component 10 may include a simulated French seam 20.  This type of simulated seam can appear as if two portions of material are sewn together with the extra material of each portion folded under and sewn to
itself.  This embodiment includes a pre-formed ridge 46'' that may be formed in the covering 28 generally parallel to the pre-determined stitch path 42 prior to the covering 28 being disposed over the substrate 26.  This version of ridge 46'' is a
depression or downstanding ridge, and may also be formed in a thermoforming process.  Simulated seam 20 of FIG. 8 includes two lines of decorative stitching 24 along spaced apart stitch paths 42, equally spaced from and parallel to ridge 46''.  Seam
spacer 60 has a non-uniform thickness, though it is symmetric with respect to the center of the seam 20.  In this example, the seam spacer 60 includes two main portions 62 that lie along respective dual stitch paths 42, with an auxiliary portion 64
connecting the two main portions 62.  The main portions 62 are the thickest portions of the seam spacer 60.
 Example seam spacers are illustrated separately in FIGS. 9 and 10 and may be used with the embodiment of FIG. 8 or with other embodiments.  FIG. 9 shows one example of seam spacer 60 having two spaced apart main portions 62 connected by
auxiliary portion 64.  This embodiment may be constructed similar to that of FIG. 6, only with an additional main portion at the opposite widthwise edge.  FIG. 10 illustrates an example of a seam spacer 60' having additional auxiliary portions 66'
extending in a direction away from auxiliary portion 64' to form the widthwise edges of the seam spacer.  Portions 66' are also shown as dashed lines in FIG. 8.  Portions 66 may be useful for handling seam spacer 60' during manufacturing, such as during
sewing operations.  Other types of seam spacers are possible with such dual-stitch seams where two reduced thickness portions may be formed in the covering.  For example, two separate seam spacers like those in FIG. 1 may be used to support the covering
or fill the gap created by the reduced thickness portions.  Multi-piece seam spacers, similar to that of FIG. 7 except with two main portions, may also be used.
 Turning now to FIG. 11, a simulated French seam 20 similar to that of FIG. 8 is shown.  In this embodiment, the seam spacer 70 has a uniform cross-section that spans the distance between the dual-stitch paths 42.  The resulting simulated seam 20
includes the downstanding ridge 46'' of FIG. 8, but with a more complex overall shape due to the additional bulge created by the spacer 70.  This embodiment has some similarity to that of FIG. 4 in that the spacer 70 helps to define the overall shape of
the ridge by doing more than filling the gaps resulting from reduced thickness portions 44.  The resulting appearance to the simulated French seam may by more realistic due to the appearance that additional material is folded under and sewn to itself.
 FIG. 12 illustrates a different type of simulated French seam 20 that includes dual lines of decorative stitching 24, along with functional stitching 24' that joins separate portions of covering material together.  Some non-limiting examples of
this type of simulated French seam are disclosed in co-assigned U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 13/158,967 filed Jun.  13, 2011.  The illustrated embodiment shows a seam spacer 60 similar to that of FIG. 9, but other seam spacers may be used, such as
the uniform thickness seam spacer of FIG. 11.
 The use of seam spacers according to these and other embodiments along covering stitch paths to fill gaps or voids caused by sewing decorative stitching through covering materials may enhance the final appearance of the vehicle interior
component by supporting the covering over the substrate at reduced thickness portion(s) so that an undesirable sunken area in the covering is prevented along the stitch path.  Such seam spacers may offer the additional advantage of enhancing the illusion
of a true seam, such as a deck seam or French seam, by creating additional raised features or bulges in the covering material as if the covering material is folded under at the simulated seam.  Additionally, these types of separate seam spacers can be
attached to the covering, rather than being molded into the underlying substrate in the form of ribs or other standing substrate features, offering additional manufacturing and design flexibility.  For example, different covering designs having simulated
seams at different locations along their respective surfaces can be disposed over a common smooth substrate surface.  To accomplish the same with ribs molded into the substrates, additional molding tools must be constructed to mold different substrates. 
In the context of vehicle instrument panels, this means that a common substrate from a single molding tool can be used both with a more plain, lower cost covering for a lower trim level vehicle, and with a more decorative covering, having simulated
French seams for example, for a higher trim level vehicle.  Of course, substrate ribs may still be utilized along with seam spacers where desired.
 One embodiment of a method of making a vehicle interior component having decorative stitching may include the steps of sewing a line of decorative stitching through a decorative covering along a stitch path, attaching a seam spacer to the
covering along the stitch path at the inner surface of the covering, and disposing the covering over a component substrate so that the seam spacer separates the covering inner surface from the substrate along the stitch path.  The steps of sewing and
attaching the seam spacer may be performed simultaneously or separately.  The method may further include forming a ridge or a ridge feature in the decorative covering.  Such a ridge feature may be formed either before or after the step of sewing.  For
example, as described in some of the embodiments of vehicle interior components above, the seam spacer may include additional thickness along its width in excess of the thickness necessary to fill the gap formed between the substrate and the covering at
the reduced thickness portion of the covering.  Disposing a covering with such a seam spacer attached at its inner surface can form a visible ridge in the decorative covering when disposed over the substrate, or it may change the shape of an existing
ridge.
 Alternatively or additionally, a ridge may be pre-formed in the covering, as mentioned above.  In one embodiment, a pre-formed ridge is provided in the covering by a thermoforming process when materials such as TPO or other thermoplastic
materials are used in the construction of the covering.  In a thermoforming process, the covering is heated and the outer surface of the covering is forced against a die or mold having the desired shape for the ridge formed therein.  Such a thermoforming
process may or may not be vacuum- or pressure-assisted.  Vacuum-assisted thermoforming may be useful when forming a ridge that is undercut as shown in the example of FIG. 5.  Thermoforming or vacuum-assisted thermoforming may also be used to impart a
grain or surface texture onto the outer surface of the covering in the same or different operation in which a ridge is formed.  This type of process may be referred to as in-mold graining or IMG.  Pre-formed ridges may be useful in subsequent sewing
operations to provide a sewing guide so that the stitch path parallels the ridge.
 These example method steps may be part of an overall method having more steps where the individual steps are broken into multiple other steps or additional steps are added before, after, simultaneous with, or between those described above.  It

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The invention relates to a headrest assembly for a motor vehicle adapted to transport a wheelchair with a person seated thereon.  The headrest assembly provides a head restraint for a person seated in the wheelchair located in the vehicle's
operator's position or front passenger position.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Whiplash neck injury is a common injury to a person following a motor vehicle crash.  Whiplash causes a rapid hyperextension of the cervical spine in which the person's head is thrown back creating large angular displacements.  The extension
phase builds energy in the elastic components of the neck and is followed by an abrupt release of energy and forward thrust of the head and neck.  The result of whiplash includes injury of a number of structures in the person's neck including
intervertebral discs, facet joints, ligaments, muscles, nerves and paralyzing spinal cord injury.  Most persons will recover from whiplash in a short period of time.  However, a significant number of persons with whiplash injuries transition to chronic
pain conditions where treatment is long term with expensive musculoskeletal conditions to treat.
 Passenger cars have been required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard since January 1969 to provide head restraints for each designated front-outboard seating position.  The head restraint requirement was extended to light trucks,
multipurpose passenger vehicles and buses.  The head restraint requirement includes vans and trucks used to transport persons seated in wheelchairs located in vehicle operators and front seating positions.  The head restraint must withstand a rearward
load of 200 pounds and be located at least 27.5 inches above the seating reference point.
 Conventional wheelchairs are not equipped with head restraints.  Headrest attachments are available as attachments for use with wheelchairs.  E. W. Hudson and L. B. Anderson in U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,989,836 discloses a wheelchair headrest attached
to opposite vertical upright frame members.  The headrest includes two resilient head supports for preventing involuntary head movement of a person seated in the wheelchair.  Wheelchair head restraints do not have the strength necessary for a head
restraint required for motor vehicles.  Also, wheelchair back rests are not designed to accommodate substantial rearward loads during a motor vehicle crash.
 Motor vehicles, such as pickup trucks and vans, have been equipped with wheelchair lifts that move a wheelchair with a person seated thereon from a ground position to a vehicle operator position.  C. Williams and J. DeVal in U.S.  Pat.  No.
6,726,435 disclose a personal mobility lift for a motor vehicle operable to move a wheelchair from an outside location through the door opening to the vehicle operator's position.  The lift and wheelchair do not include head restraints.  S. L. Kitchin
and K. J. Schlosser in U.S.  Patent Publication No. US 2011/0070057 disclosed a pickup truck with an extended cab equipped with a wheelchair lift mechanism for moving a wheelchair into and out of the cab.  When the wheelchair is in the cab, it is located
in the vehicle operator's position.  The wheelchair lift does not include a head restraint for the head of the person seated in the wheelchair.  P. E. Schlangen in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  7,284,944 and 7,347,658 disclose a wheelchair lift assembly operable to
elevate a platform supporting a wheelchair from a ground position to a vehicle operator's position.  The lift assembly has a head restraint located behind the head of the person seated in the wheelchair when the wheelchair is in the vehicle operator's
position.  Motor vehicles equipped with wheelchair lift devices located on the sides or rear of the vehicle do not include headrest assemblies that allow the wheelchair with a person seated thereon to be moved into and out of vehicle operator's or front
passenger positions.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The headrest assembly of the invention provides a motor vehicle, such as a van, pickup truck or bus, with head restraint pads for persons in wheelchairs located in either vehicle operator or front passenger positions.  The headrest assembly
locates the head restraint pad behind the back of the head of the person seated in the wheelchair to reduce whiplash injury in the event of a vehicle crash.  The headrest assembly has an upright column connected to the floor and additional frame
structure of the vehicle to fix the location of the column in the vehicle's interior compartment.  A horizontal arm is movably mounted on the column for movement between first and second positions.  An attachment connected to the arm supports a head
restraint pad which is movable with the arm between a first position behind the head of the person seated in the wheelchair to a second position spaced from the head of the person seated in the wheelchair.  The head restraint when in the first position
is in close proximity to the back of a person's head of a person seated in the wheelchair.  Moving the head restraint pad from the first position to the second position remote from the person's head and wheelchair allows the wheelchair to be moved into
and out of the vehicle operator or front passenger positions.  An actuator is operable to move the arm between the first and second positions and retain the arm in either position.  The actuator is a linear piston and cylinder assembly having a threaded
member driven by an electric motor to expand and contract the piston and cylinder assembly to move the arm between the first and second positions thereby moving the head restraint pad to a first position behind the head of the person seated in the
wheelchair to a second position spaced from the head of the person seated in the wheelchair. DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING

mechanism.
 Examples of motor vehicles with wheelchair lift mechanisms are disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,726,435 and U.S.  Patent Publication No. US 2011/0070057.  Headrest assemblies are not included in these wheelchair lift mechanisms or the vehicles
associated with these wheelchair lift mechanisms.
 Wheelchair 19 accommodates a person 21 in a position to operate vehicle 10.  A wheelchair restraining device attached to floor 12 locks onto the wheelchair 19 to prevent it from moving on floor 12.  One wheelchair restraining device is disclosed
in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,352,396, incorporated herein by reference.  The person's head 22 is located in front of a headrest restraint pad 72 of the headrest assembly 23.  The back of the person's head 22 is horizontally aligned with the central section of
pad 72 to provide potential whiplash protection.  As shown in FIG. 4, wheelchair 19 is located in the front passenger location 19 with a conventional seat 17 having a headrest 20 located in the vehicle operator's position.  The restraint pad 72 located
above the rear or back of wheelchair 19 is adapted to be horizontally aligned in close proximity with the back of a person's head when the person is seated in the wheelchair.  Conventional seat belts are used to maintain the person in wheelchair 19.
 A shown in FIGS. 2, 5, 6 and 7, headrest assembly 23 has an upright pillar, post or column 24 having an upper end secured to a top connector 26 and a lower end secured to a bottom connector 37.  Top connector 26 includes a U-shaped member 27
located around the upper end of column 24.  Bolts 31 and 32 extended through vertical slots 28 and 29 secure column to U-shaped member 27.  Slots 28 and 29 allow for vertical adjustment of U-shaped member 27 on column 24.  A plate 33 secured to the top
of U-shaped member 27 is attached with bolts 34 and 36 to roof frame 11.  Other structures including but not limited to U-bolts can be used to secure the upper end of column 24 to roof frame 11.  The bottom connector 37 includes a U-shaped member 38
having upright slots 39 and 41 accommodating bolts 42 and 43 that secure connector 37 to the bottom of column 24.  Slots 39 and 41 allow for vertical adjustment of U-shaped member 38 on column 24.  The adjustments of U-shaped members 27 and 38 on column
24 compensate for variations in the distance between roof frame 11 and floor 12 of vehicle 10.  Connectors 26 and 37 mount column 24 in a fixed upright location adjacent the back of console 18.  Column 24 is in a central location on floor 12 behind and
between operator and passenger location 14 and 16.  The location of column 25 on floor 12 can vary to allow wheelchair 19 to be moved into and out of vehicle operator location 14 or passenger location 16 of vehicle 10.  Column 24 can be secured to only
roof frame 11 or floor 12 of vehicle 10 to retain column in a fixed location on vehicle 10.
 As shown in FIGS. 6 to 9, a horizontal arm 48 extended laterally from column 24 supports head restraint pad 72 in vehicle operator position 14 behind wheelchair 19.  Arm 48 is a tubular member that extends through an opening in the sides of
column 25.  Supports 49 and 51 secured to opposite sides of column 24 retain arm 48 on column 24 for lateral movements between an extended first position, shown in FIG. 12, to a retracted second position, shown in FIG. 13.  Referring to FIG. 10, support
49 has a box member 52 secured with welds to one side of column 24.  An upper cylindrical roller 53 located in box member 52 engages the top surface of arm 48.  A bolt or axle 54 rotatably mounts roller 53 on the side walls of box member 52.  A lower
cylindrical roller 56 engages the bottom surface of arm 48.  A bolt or axle 57 mounts roller 56 on the side walls of box member 52.  The side walls of arm 48 are located in sliding surface engagement with the inside surfaces of the side walls of box
member 52 to prevent angular or swinging movement of arm 48 relative to column 24.  Support 51 has the same box member and rollers as support 49.  As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, support 51 comprises a box member 58 secured with welds to the side of column
opposite box member 52.  Upper and lower rollers 59 and 62 are rotatably mounted with bolts or axles 61 and 63 on box member 58 with roller 59 in engagement with the top surface of arm 48 and roller 62 in engagement with the bottom surface of arm 48. 
Arm 48 rides on rollers 53, 56 and 59, 62 during movement between first extended and second retracted positions.  Roller 53, 56 and 59, 62 prevent arm 48 from angular or swinging movement in a vertical plan relative to column 24.
 An attachment 65 connected to arm 48 supports a head restraint pad 72 in a first position in close proximity to the back of the head of the person seated in wheelchair 19 and alternatively in a second position spaced or remote from the head of
the person seated in the wheelchair.  Attachment 65, head restraint pad 72, and column 24 have combined strength to withstand forces of the head during a vehicle crash to inhibit whiplash injury.  Attachment 65 has a first tubular member 64, shown in
FIGS. 9 and 11, secured with welds to the outer end of arm 48.  Member 64 is located in the horizontal plane of arm 48 and is perpendicular to arm 48.  A second tubular member 66 is telescoped through member 64.  The outer walls of member 64 are in
sliding surface engagement with the inside surfaces of member 64 to limit adjustment of member 66 into only linear movement.  Member 66 has a plurality of vertical holes 67 spaced along the length of the top and bottom of the member 66.  Member 64 has a
hole 68 aligned with a hole 67.  As shown in FIG. 11, a lock pin 69 extends through holes 67 and 68 to fix the location of member 66 on member 64.  Pin 69 is vertically removable to allow adjustment of the member 66 on member 64.
 A flat plate 71, shown in FIGS. 8 and 13, is secured with welds to the forward end of member 66.  A cushion or head restraint pad 72, is connected to plate 71 with a plurality of fasteners 73, shown as bolts, extended through vertical slots 74
in plate 71.  Fasteners 73 and vertical slots 74 in plate 71 permits vertical adjustment of the location of restraint pad 72.  Restraint pad 72 is a headrest that is adjustable in horizontal and vertical positions to accommodate head positions of
different vehicle operators.
 Arm 48 and restraint pad 72 are moved between first extended and second retracted positions with a motion transmission device or actuator 76.  As shown in FIGS. 7 and 9, actuator 76 comprises a piston 77 and cylinder 78.  A bracket 79 secures
cylinder 78 to the front side of column 24.  Piston 77, as seen in FIG. 9, has an end located in a U-shaped bracket 84.  Bracket 84 is welded to member 64.  A pin 81 connects piston 77 to bracket 84.  An electric motor 82 mounted on cylinder 78 powers
actuator 76.  A power transmission 83, such as a chain, belt, thread or gear drive mechanism, drivably couples electric motor 82 to actuator 76.  A motor controller 84 wired to electric motor 82 is used by the vehicle operator 22 to control the operation
of electric motor 82 to move arm 48 and headrest 72 between extended and retracted positions.  Other types of devices can be used to move arm 48 and restraint pad 72 between extended and retracted positions as shown in FIGS. 12 and 13.
 Headrest assembly 23 is an adjunct to a motor vehicle, such as a van disclosed by P. E. Schlangen in U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,735,839; incorporated herein by reference.  The wheelchair is first moved into the interior compartment of the vehicle with a
lift mechanism or powered into the van of U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,735,839.  Headrest assembly 23 is operated to move arm 48 in the second retracted position, as shown in FIG. 13, to provide access to the vehicle operator's position.  The wheelchair with the
person seated thereon is then wheeled into the vehicle operator's position behind the steering wheel and adjacent the vehicle controls.  After the wheelchair is locked into vehicle operator's position, headrest assembly 23 is actuated to move arm 48 to
the second extended position whereby the head restraint pad 72 is located behind the head of the person seated in the wheelchair.  The horizontal position of head restraint pad 72 is adjusted to locate the head restraint pad 72 in close proximity to the
back of the head of the person seated in the wheelchair to inhibit whiplash in event of a vehicle crash.  The distance between head restraint pad 72 and the person's head is adjusted to less than 4 inches.
 The headrest assembly has been described and illustrated in the drawing with reference to use in motor vehicles.  Modifications, changes of materials and structures and use of the headrest assembly can be made by persons skilled in the art
without departing from the invention.

 The present invention is directed to a flexible sliding lid, such as a lid that may be used to cover, for example, a storage compartment in a vehicle.
BACKGROUND
 Various devices may be equipped with sliding lids of different design.  Of particular interest with respect to the present invention are tambour-style (flexible) sliding lids, which typically include a number of strips or segments that are
flexibly joined to permit sliding of the lid along a curved path.  This type of lid has been used for many years on furniture, such as roll top desks.  This type of lid has also made its way into the automotive field, and may be found in use as a cover
element for a storage compartment--most commonly a center console storage compartment.
 As would no doubt be familiar to many, current vehicle storage compartment flexible lid designs may allow objects resting on the lid to pass along with the lid into a substantially inaccessible area of the associated storage compartment
structure when the lid is retracted.  This makes retrieval of such objects difficult if not impossible without disassembling the storage compartment.
 As illustrated in the transparent view of FIG. 1A, certain known vehicle storage compartment 5 designs attempt to provide a minimized gap 10 (or actual interference), between a top surface of a flexible sliding lid 15 and an overlying portion 20
of the storage compartment housing 25 in order to prevent the passage of objects into the storage compartment interior.  The idea behind this design is that the overlying portion 20 of the storage compartment housing 25 will act as a barrier to entry of
objects into the storage compartment housing.  Unfortunately, if the provided gap 10 is larger than intended due to manufacturing tolerances or to a change in part dimensions (e.g., due to aging or temperature), or if an intended interference fit fails
to interfere for the same or similar reasons, then objects may still pass between the lid 15 and the overlying portion 20 of the housing structure and into the interior of the storage compartment housing 25.
 As depicted in FIG. 1B, an alternative known design vehicle storage compartment 30 design employs a somewhat flexible rubber guard 35 to prevent objects from passing into the interior of the storage compartment housing 40 when the flexible
sliding lid 45 is opened.  The guard 35 extends downward from an overlying portion 50 of the compartment housing 40 to contact the lid 45 across its entire upper surface, and to block the passage of objects into the interior of the storage compartment
housing 40 when the lid is retracted.  Unfortunately, it has been found that this design suffers from problems similar to those described above with respect to the design of FIG. 1A, and objects still undesirably get past the guard 35 and find their way
into the interior of the storage compartment housing 40.  Causing the guard 35 to exert a greater contact force on the sliding lid 45 may reduce the number of objects that get past the guard but, as should be obvious, also makes sliding of the lid more
difficult.
 In light of the problems associated with known vehicle storage compartment designs, it would be desirable to provide a storage compartment design that prevents objects that inadvertently pass with an associated flexible lid into the interior of
the storage compartment from being lost.  The sliding lid design of the present invention provides this function.
SUMMARY
 The present invention is directed to a storage compartment flexible lid assembly designed to prevent objects that pass between the lid and a guard and/or an overlying portion of a storage compartment housing from being lost within the storage
compartment.  To this end, the flexible lid assembly includes a sliding flexible lid having one or a series of spaced ribs that extend upward from a top surface of the lid along a rear portion thereof.  The rib or ribs block objects from passing between
the lid and the storage compartment housing when the lid is in a closed position and collect objects that pass with the lid into the storage compartment when the lid is opened.
 The lid assembly includes a cover plate, which may or may not be a part of the storage compartment housing.  The cover plate includes a groove or a series of grooves that correspond to and are aligned with the rib/ribs on the lid.  The
groove/grooves extend linearly along an inner wall of the cover plate in the direction of travel of the lid, thereby forming a lid track.  The rib/ribs on the lid extend into and ride in the groove/grooves in the cover plate when the lid is slidably
opened and closed.
 If an object that is small enough to pass between the lid and the cover plate or an overlying housing portion resides on the lid during lid opening, the object will pass into the space between the lid and cover plate, where it will be caught by
the projecting rib/ribs.  The object is thus prevented from passing entirely over the lid and into an inaccessible interior space of the storage compartment housing.  When the lid is subsequently closed, the object will remain on the lid surface and will
be moved along with the lid due to supporting contact with the rib/ribs.  As the lid becomes more fully closed, the object will be extracted from the lid track area and returned to an exposed position along the rear of the lid so that the object may be
easily retrieved. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT(S)
 One exemplary embodiment of a sliding flexible lid assembly 100 for use with an associated storage compartment is shown in FIGS. 2-6.  The particular sliding flexible lid assembly (hereinafter ""lid assembly"") shown and described herein is
designed for use with a vehicle storage compartment, such as a center console storage compartment.  However, it should be apparent that a similar design could also be used in conjunction with other devices that employ tambour-style lids.
 The exemplary lid assembly 100 is shown in FIGS. 2-6 with other portions of an associated storage compartment housing removed for clarity.  As would be well understood by one of skill in the art, the lid assembly 100 viewable in the drawing
figures would actually be installed to/within a storage compartment housing such that only a lid 105 portion of the assembly would typically be visible.  The lid 105 would normally cover a subjacent storage compartment, which may be accessed by slidably
opening the lid as described in more detail below.
 As shown, the lid assembly 100 includes the lid 105, which is comprised of a plurality of flexibly interconnected lid segments 110.  Such lids are well known in the art and, therefore, need not be discussed in detail herein.  In this particular
embodiment, the non-interconnected opposite ends of the lid segments 110 are slidably retained in opposed guide rails 115 that direct the sliding movement of the lid 105 during opening and closing thereof.  As this particular lid assembly 100 is designed
for use with a vehicle center storage console, the guide rails 115 extend for some distance in a substantially horizontal plane before curving downward toward what would be the floor of an associated vehicle.  During opening and closing, the flexible
nature of the lid 105 allows it to follow the curved path defined by the guide rails 115.  Other guides may be employed in other embodiments.  Thus, the lid of a lid assembly may be guided by other than a pair of opposed guide rails.
 A cover plate 120 overlies at least an upper surface of a rearward portion of the guide rails 115, such that an inner wall 120a of the cover plate is adjacent the top surface of the lid 105 when the lid is slid rearward (opened).  In this
particular exemplary embodiment of the lid assembly 100, the cover plate 120 is actually in the form of a lid enclosure 145 that surrounds a rearward portion of the guides 115 and has an open interior into which the lid 105 disappears when opened.  In
other embodiments, the cover plate 120 may simply be a plate that resides along only the upper surface of the guide rails 115.  In either case, the cover plate may be a separate element that is attached to the guide rails 115 or another element of the
lid assembly 100 and resides within an associated storage compartment housing, or it may be an integral part of a storage compartment housing to which the lid and guides of the lid assembly are installed.  Therefore, while the cover plate 120 (lid
enclosure 145) is shown to be a separate element herein for purposes of illustration, other designs are possible.
 A handle 140 may be provided at or near a leading (forward) end 105a of the lid 105.  More importantly, and as can be best observed in FIGS. 2-3, a plurality of ribs 125 extend outward (upward in this case) from the exposed top surface of the
lid 105 near a trailing (rearward) end 105b thereof.  In other embodiments of the invention (not shown), the plurality of ribs 125 may be replaced by a single upwardly protruding rib that extends across or substantially across the top surface of the lid
in a direction that is transverse or substantially transverse to the sliding direction thereof.
 The upwardly extending orientation of the ribs 125 along the rearward end 105b of the lid allows the ribs to block objects from passing between any gap G that might exist between the top surface of the lid and the cover plate 120 or an overlying
portion of an associated storage compartment housing when the lid is closed.  This would not be the case if the ribs 125 are oriented to extend from, for example, a rear face of the lid 105 and in a direction substantially parallel to the path of travel
of the lid.
 As described in more detail below, and as is best illustrated in the partially transparent view of FIG. 6, the ribs 125 also prevent objects that pass through the gap G during lid opening from being lost within the interior of a storage
compartment housing.  Again, arranging the ribs 125 to extend outward from the top surface of the lid 105 allows the free ends of the ribs 125 to extend into corresponding grooves 130 that run linearly along the path of travel of the lid to form a lid
track 135 (see FIG. 6) in an adjacent inner wall 120a of the cover plate 120.  This would not be possible if the ribs 125 are made to extend rearward from a rear face of a tambour-style lid.  Nor would such a design allow lost items to be returned to a
readily accessible position upon closing of a tambour-style or pivoting lid, as is described in more detail below as occurring with a sliding lid of the present invention.
 The grooves 130 may be dimensioned such that a slight gap exists between the grooves and the ribs 125, or the ribs may actually contact one or more walls of the grooves.  The ribs 125 and grooves 130 may be provided in varying number, such that
the number of ribs and grooves on a given lid may be lesser or greater than the number shown in the drawing figures.  For example, a single rib and corresponding groove may replace the plurality of spaced ribs and grooves shown and described with respect
to the exemplary embodiment shown herein.  The rib-to-rib and corresponding groove-to-groove spacing may also vary accordingly and may depend on, for example, the width of the lid and/or on an expected size of potential objects that the ribs might be
required to collect.
 Referring to FIG. 6, the interaction of the ribs 125 on the lid 105 with the grooves 130 in the cover plate 120 during sliding of the lid can be observed.  As shown, the lid 105 is being returned toward a closed position from an open or
partially open position (as indicated by the arrows).  As such, a portion of the lid 105 resides beneath the cover plate 120 (within the lid housing 145) and the ribs 125 on the lid extend at least partially into the grooves 130 therein.
 Based on the extension of the ribs 125 into the grooves 130, it can be understood that an object carried rearward along the top surface of the lid 105 during lid opening cannot pass between the ribs and the inner wall 120a of the guide housing. 
Further, unless such an object is small enough to pass through both the gap G between the top surface of the lid 105 and the cover plate 120, and the space between adjacent ribs 125, the ribs will prevent the object from traveling past the rearward end
of the lid and becoming lost in the interior space of the associated storage compartment housing.
 Therefore, as illustrated in FIG. 6, an object 150 that does travel with the lid 105 through the gap G, will be restrained by the ribs 125 and trapped within the space formed between the top surface of the lid 105 and the inner wall 120a of the
cover plate 120.  Consequently, when the lid 105 is subsequently returned to a closed position, the ribs 125 will cause the object 100 to be carried along with the lid until the object emerges through the gap G between the lid 105 and cover plate 120
where it can be easily retrieved.
 While the rib-to-rib spacing of the exemplary embodiment shown and described herein appears quite large for purposes of clarity, it should be apparent that the ribs provided on a lid of the present invention may be spaced at a sufficiently small
distance from one another to catch virtually any object that might pass through the gap G, and to return such objects as described above.  Thus, a lid assembly of the present invention ensures that objects that do pass into a storage compartment housing
with a sliding lid will be returned upon lid closing rather than being irretrievably lost absent storage compartment disassembly.
 While certain embodiments of the present invention are described in detail above, the scope of the invention is not to be considered limited by such disclosure, and modifications are possible without departing from the spirit of the invention as
evidenced by the following claims:

BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
 1.  Field of the Disclosure
 The present disclosure relates generally to a modular transit system, and more particularly, to a modular transit system having a seating system that includes various interchangeable parts.
 2.  Description of the Background of the Disclosure
 Development of seating systems in mass transit have traditionally involved a company pre-selecting a desired seating configuration and permanently installing the pre-selected configuration into a transit car or multiple transit cars.  The
procurement, design, implementation, and manufacturing process may take many years to complete so a company must plan ahead for the types of configurations that the company desires.  If a company wishes to deviate from the pre-selected selections, the
company must re-order the seating system and/or re-configure the car interior.  Either of these options are extremely cost prohibitive.
 The traditional seating systems suffer from many disadvantages.  For example, once a transit car is designed and manufactured, the configuration of seating is limited to the original design.  Still further, the transit company may have special
ordered some unique configurations, but the transit car configurations are limited.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention provides a modular transit system having a track system and/or modular seating that can be used to modify a transit car.  The track system can support a variety of attachments to allow the transit car to be reconfigured.
 According to one embodiment of the present invention, an adjustable furnishing system is de-mountably mountable to a generally vertical wall.  The adjustable furnishing system comprises a mounting structure carried by the wall, a support frame
having opposite first and second ends, and a furnishing carried by the support frame.  The first end of the support frame releasably attaches to the mounting structure and the mounting structure supports the support frame in a cantilevered position with
the second end extending outwardly from the wall with the furnishing carried thereon.
 According to another embodiment of the present invention, a modular seat assembly is comprised of an elongate support spine extending longitudinally from a first end to a second end.  A seat portion is connected to a front side of the support
spine, and each of the seat portion and the support spine includes one of a complementary pair of interlocking portions.  Additionally, the interlocking portion of the seat portion slides onto the interlocking portion of the support spine over the first
end.  The modular seat assembly further includes an end cap lockably disposed over the first end that prevents the seat portion from sliding off the support spine.
 According to still another embodiment of the present invention, a method of assembling a modular seating system, including a seat portion attachable to a support spine, is disclosed.  The method comprises the step of releasably attaching the
seat portion to the support spine by sliding a projection of one along a channel of the other from one end of the support spine, wherein the projection interlocks with the channel.  The method further comprises the step of locking an end cap over the end
of the support spine to prevent the seat portion from dissembling from the support spine. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 The present disclosure is directed to a modular transit system and may be embodied in many different forms.  Several specific embodiments are discussed herein with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered only as an
exemplification of the principles of the disclosure, and it is not intended to limit the disclosure to the embodiments illustrated.
 Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1 depicts a transit system that includes an elongate transit car 52, a track system 54 attached to a wall 56 of the transit car 52, and a plurality of modular seats 58 attached to and extending outwardly from the
track system 54.  The transit car 52 includes doors 59 and windows 53 disposed along a length thereof that are of a kind known in the art.  As shown in FIG. 2, the track system 54 includes a first channel 60 having a grab bar 61 extending outwardly
therefrom.  The grab bar 61 includes a bulbous hook 63 extending upwardly from an end 65 of the grab bar 61.  The grab bar 61 generally extends outwardly from a medial portion 62 of the wall 56 of the transit car 52.  A locking mechanism (not shown) may
be included in an interior section of the grab bar 61 such that other components are able to interlock with the grab bar 61.  If a seat 58 is not attached to the track system 54, the grab bar 61 and more specifically, the bulbous hook 63, may be utilized
to provide an additional surface for a user to grab onto during transit.  Any type of locking mechanism known in the art may be utilized including locking mechanisms that allow modular seats and/or attachments to be attached and detached therefrom.
 Still referring to FIG. 2, a channel 64 is disposed in a surface 67 in a bottom section 66 of the transit car 52 located adjacent the grab bar 61.  The channel 64 may include an attachment component, such as a recess (not shown), in a top
surface 69 thereof that is adapted to interact with a support member in the form of a strut 70.  The strut 70 is comprised of an elongate base member 72 that includes an upwardly extending notch 74 at a first end 76 thereof.  The strut 70 further
includes two upwardly extending protrusions 78a, 78b that are adapted to interact with the modular seats 58 as described in more detail hereinbelow.  The notch 74 is preferably angled and sized to correspond to the channel 67 such that the strut 70 can
be aligned with and may be inserted into the channel 67 to secure the strut 70 to the track system 54 disposed on the wall 56 of the transit car 52.  The strut 70 includes a latch 77 that extends upwardly from the base member 72 and is adapted to help
secure the strut 70 to the wall 56.  The latch 77 can be rotated from a first, unlocked position to a second, locked position, once the strut 70 is inserted into the channel 67.  The strut 70 further includes an end cap or strut cap 73 (FIG. 3) disposed
at an end 75 thereof that provides aesthetic benefits as well as having the capability to accept implements as described in more detail below.
 Still referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, a secondary strut 80 is used to provide structural reinforcement and to secure a top portion 82 of the modular seat 58 to the track system 54 attached to the wall 56 of the transit car 52.  The secondary strut
80 includes a latch 83 extending from a front side 84 of the strut 80 that helps secure and lock the strut 80 to the wall 56.  The secondary strut 80 further includes a hook member 86 extending from an end 88 thereof that is adapted to lock into the
bulbous hook 63 of the grab bar 61.  As shown in FIG. 3, the secondary strut 80 includes two upwardly extending triangular protrusions 90a, 90b, that are adapted to interact with the modular seats 58 as described in more detail hereinbelow.  The
secondary strut 80 may further include a strut cap 92 that locks into the secondary strut 80 at a second end 94 to provide aesthetic benefits as well as having the capability to accept implements as described in more detail below.
 Although the track system 54, including the grab bar 61 and the channel 64 are depicted as integral with the wall 56 of the transit car 52, any of the track system 54 components may be installed as separate parts that are attached to an outside
surface of the wall 56.  Further, latches 77, 83 may be utilized to secure the struts 70, 80 to the track system 54 and/or other locking mechanisms may be used as known in the art such as, for example, lock and key.  It is preferable that the latches 77,
83 are positioned such the seat 58 covers the latches 77, 83 when the seat 58 is attached to the struts 70, 80.  The hidden latches 77, 83 prevent unauthorized persons from accessing and unlocking the struts 70, 80.
 A modular seat 200, as best seen in FIG. 3, may be used with the track system 54 disclosed previously herein, or may be used with other track systems as known in the art.  The modular seat 200 includes a first generally vertical seat portion
201, a second generally horizontal seat portion 203, and a center support spine 202 having an upper section 204 and a lower section 206 connected by a bent portion 208 and adapted to support the first and second seat portions 201, 203, respectively.  The
vertical seat portion 201 and horizontal seat portion 203 may be seat cushions.  The center spine 202 includes a plurality of tracks disposed in a front surface 210 and rear surface 212 thereof.  The front surface 210 includes an upper channel 214a and a

SUMMARY OF INVENTION
Technical Problem
 An object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle seat device that can provide a space in which a large-sized load can be disposed.
Solution to Problem
 According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a vehicle seat device comprising: first and second seats arranged next to each other in a vehicle width direction; front movement means for moving the first seat to a foot space
positioned in front of the first seat; and vehicle-width-direction movement means for allowing the first seat, which has moved into the foot space, to move to a foot space positioned in front of the second seat.
 It is preferred that the vehicle-width-direction movement means comprise a slide rail extending in the vehicle width direction from the foot space of the first seat to the foot space of the second seat, and the seat device have a first support
leg for supporting the first seat, the first support leg being supported by the slide rail so as to be capable of moving in the vehicle width direction, the first support leg supporting the first seat so as to be capable of frontward rotation with
respect to a vehicle body floor.
 Desirably, the seat device has a second support leg for supporting the second seat so as to be capable of frontward rotation with respect to the vehicle body floor, the second support leg being supported by the slide rail so as to be capable of
moving in the vehicle width direction.
Advantageous Effects of Invention
 The vehicle seat device comprises front movement means for moving the first seat to the foot space, and vehicle-width-direction movement means for allowing the first seat that has moved into the foot space to move into the foot space of the
second seat.  It is thereby possible to move the first seat into the foot space, and move the first seat that has moved into the foot space to the front of the second seat.
 Moving the first seat to the front of the second seat makes it possible to remove the first seat from a space in which the first seat is arranged in a seating state, or from the foot space of the first seat.  It is thereby possible to combine
the space in which the first seat is arranged in the seating state with the foot space of the first seat.  A large load space can thereby be provided, and a bicycle, a motorcycle, or a similar large-sized load can be disposed in the large load space.
 Also, in the present invention, a slide rail is used as the vehicle-width-direction movement means, and the first support leg is supported on the slide rail so as to be capable of movement.  The first seat is supported by the first support leg
so as to be capable of frontward rotation with respect to the vehicle body floor.  Thus, it is possible to provide a load space, in which a large-sized load can be disposed, using a simple configuration comprising only the slide rail and the first
support leg.
 Also, the present invention comprises a second support leg for supporting the second seat so as to be capable of frontward rotation with respect to the vehicle body floor.  The second support leg is supported by the slide rail so as to be
capable of movement.  It is thereby possible, as with the first seat, to move the second seat to the foot space, and to move the second seat that has moved into the foot space to the front of the first seat.
 Moving the second seat to the front of the first seat makes it possible to remove the second seat from a space in which the second seat is arranged in a seating state, or from the foot space of the second seat.  It is thereby possible to combine
the space in which the second seat is arranged in the seating state with the foot space of the second seat.  Combining these spaces makes it possible to provide a large load space, and to dispose a bicycle, a motorcycle, or a similar large-sized load in
the large load space.
 Thus, it is possible to select, according to the intended use of the vehicle, between an instance in which the first seat is removed and a load space is provided, and an instance in which the second seat is removed and a load space is provided. 
As a result, there is increased freedom in regard to the layout for providing a load space, and convenience can be improved.
 The first support leg and the second support leg are supported by a common slide rail.  It thereby becomes possible to reduce the number of slide rails, provide a large load space using a simple configuration, and increase the freedom in regard
to the layout when providing a large load space. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS

 The right rear support leg 72 comprises an inner right rear leg part 77 provided to a rear part of the inner right slide rail 68; and an outer right rear leg part 78 provided to a rear part of the outer right slide rail 69.  The inner right rear
leg part 77 is bilaterally symmetrical with respect to the inner left rear leg part 51, and a description thereof will not be provided.  The outer right rear leg part 78 is bilaterally symmetrical with respect to the outer left rear leg part 52, and a
description thereof will not be provided.
 The right front movement means 25 is bilaterally symmetrical with respect to the left front movement means 22 shown in FIG. 4.  The right front movement means 25 comprises a pair of inner brackets 81 provided upright on a right inner slider (not
shown), with a predetermined spacing provided between the inner brackets 81; an inner right support pin 83 for pivotably supporting an inner boss part 82 of the inner right front leg part 74 arranged between the inner brackets 81; a pair of outer
brackets 85 provided in a standing manner on a right outer slider (not shown), with a predetermined spacing provided between the outer brackets 85; and an outer right support pin 87 for pivotably supporting an outer boss part 86 of the outer right front
leg part 75 arranged between the outer brackets 85.  The outer right support pin 87 is provided coaxially in relation to the inner right support pin 83.
 According to the right front movement means 25, the right front support leg 71 (i.e., the inner right front leg part 74 and the outer right front leg part 75) swings forward with respect to the vehicle body about the inner and outer right
support pins 83, 87.  Swinging the right front support leg 71 forward with respect to the vehicle body makes it possible to collapse (i.e., tumble) the right rear seat 16 into the right foot space 18 in front of the right rear seat 16.  In other words,
the right rear seat 16 is supported by the right front support leg 71 so as to be capable of frontward rotation with respect to the vehicle body floor 11.
 The lateral slide rail 28 is a rail that extends in the vehicle width direction (i.e., laterally).  The lateral slide rail 28 allows the left rear seat 15 in the left foot space 17 to slide into the right foot space 18, and allows the right rear
seat 16 in the right foot space 18 to slide into the left foot space 17.  The lateral slide rail 28 comprises a rail body 91 extending in the vehicle width direction; and left and right moving units 92, 93 provided within the rail body 91 so as to be
capable of sliding (where only the left moving unit 92 is shown in detail in FIG. 4).
 The rail body 91 is provided on the vehicle body floor 11 in a state of extending in the vehicle width direction from the left foot space 17 of the left rear seat 15 to the right foot space 18 of the right rear seat 16.
 As shown in FIG. 4, the left moving unit 92 comprises the left inner slider 95 provided with the pair of inner brackets 53; the left outer slider 96 provided with the pair of outer brackets 57; and a left connection rod 97 for connecting the
left inner slider 95 and the left outer slider 96 in a coaxial manner.
 By providing the inner brackets 53 to the left inner slider 95, the inner left front leg part 44 is swingably supported by the left inner slider 95 with the inner brackets 53 and the inner left support pin 55 interposed therebetween.  By
providing the outer brackets 57 to the left outer slider 96, the outer left front leg part 45 is swingably supported by the left outer slider 96 with the outer brackets 57 and the outer left support pin 59 interposed therebetween.
 The left inner slider 95 and the left outer slider 96 are provided within the rail body 91 so as to be capable of sliding.  Therefore, sliding the left inner slider 95 and the left outer slider 96 (i.e., the left moving unit 92) along the rail
body 91 makes it possible to move the left rear seat 15, along with the left front support leg 41, in the vehicle width direction.  The left rear seat 15 can thereby move in the vehicle width direction to the right foot space 18 (see FIG. 3) in front of
the right rear seat 16.
 The right moving unit 93 shown in FIG. 3 is bilaterally symmetrical with respect to the left moving unit 92, and a detailed description will not be provided.  As with the left moving unit 92, sliding the right moving unit 93 along the rail body
91 makes it possible to move the right rear seat 16, along with the right front support leg 71, in the vehicle width direction.  The right rear seat 16 is thereby moved into the left foot space 17 (FIG. 3) in front of the left rear seat 15.  The left
moving unit 92 and the right moving unit 93 can be secured to the rail body 91 by a locking mechanism (not shown), at a desired position in the vehicle width direction in relation to the rail body 91.
 As described above, according to the vehicle seat device 10, the lateral slide rail 28 is used as the vehicle-width-direction movement means, and the left support leg 21 and the right support leg 24 are supported on the lateral slide rail 28 so
as to be capable of movement.  The left rear seat 15 is supported by the left support leg 21 so as to be capable of frontward rotation with respect to the vehicle body floor 11, and the right rear seat 16 is supported by the right support leg 24 so as to
be capable of frontward rotation with respect to the vehicle body floor 11.
 Thus, a configuration is obtained in which the left rear seat 15 can be moved into the right foot space 18 and the right rear seat 16 can be moved into the left foot space 17 using a simple configuration comprising only the lateral slide rail 28
and the left and right support legs 21, 24.  It is thereby possible, using a simple configuration, to provide a large load space in which a large-sized load can be disposed.
 The left support leg 21 for supporting the left rear seat 15 and the right support leg 24 for supporting the right rear seat 16 are supported by a common lateral slide rail 28.  It thereby becomes possible to reduce the number of the lateral
slide rails 28, provide a large load space 106 (see FIG. 5G) using a simple configuration, and provide a large load space 106.
 Next, a description will be given for an example in which the left rear seat 15 is moved into the right foot space 18, with reference to FIGS. 5A through 5G.
 As shown in FIG. 5A, the left seat back 35 of the left rear seat 15 is tilted onto the left seat cushion 34 as indicated by arrow A.
 As shown in FIG. 5B, the left seat back 35 is folded down onto the left seat cushion 34.  The left rear seat 15 having the left seat back 35 folded down is rotated (i.e., tumbled) into the left foot space 17 about the inner and outer left
support pins 55, 59 as indicated by arrow B.
 As shown in FIGS. 5C and 5D, the left rear seat 15 that has been rotated is slid into the right foot space 18 using the lateral slide rail 28 as indicated by arrow C.
 As shown in FIGS. 5E and 5F, the left rear seat 15 that has been rotated is arranged in the right foot space 18.
 The inner left front leg part 44 of the left rear seat 15 extends in a state of being inclined towards the outer side with respect to the vehicle body from the upper end part 44a to the lower end part 44b.  The inner boss part 47 (i.e., the left
inner slider 95 of the left moving unit 92 shown in FIG. 4) is thereby positioned at substantially the center of the left rear seat 15 in the vehicle width direction.
 The inner right front leg part 74 of the right rear seat 16 extends in a state of being inclined towards the outer side with respect to the vehicle body from an upper end part 74a to a lower end part 74b.  The inner boss part 82 (i.e., the right
inner slider of the right moving unit; not shown) is thereby positioned at substantially the center of the right rear seat 16 in the vehicle width direction.
 The left inner slider 95 of the left moving unit 92 (see FIG. 4) is thereby positioned near the right inner slider of the right moving unit (not shown) when the left rear seat 15 is in a state of being arranged in the right foot space 18. 
Therefore, it is possible to prevent the left inner slider 95 of the left moving unit 92 from obstructing the right inner slider of the right moving unit.
 As shown in FIG. 5G, moving the left rear seat 15 into the right foot space 18 makes it possible to remove the left rear seat 15 from a space 105 in which the left rear seat 15 is arranged in a seating state, or from the left foot space 17.  It
is thereby possible to combine the space 105 in which the left rear seat 15 is arranged in the seating state with the left foot space 17 to form the load space 106.  A large load space 106 can thereby be provided, and the slide door or the tail gate can
be opened and a bicycle 107, a motorcycle, or a similar large-sized load can be disposed in the large load space 106 from each of the openings.
 As with the left rear seat 15, the right rear seat 16 can be moved into the right foot space 18, and the right rear seat 16 that has moved into the right foot space 18 can be moved into the left foot space 17.  Moving the right rear seat 16 into
the left foot space 17 makes it possible to remove the right rear seat 16 from a space in which the right rear seat 16 is arranged in a seating state, or from the right foot space 18.  It is thereby possible to combine the space in which the right rear
seat 16 is arranged in the seating state and the right foot space 18.  A large load space can thereby be provided, and a bicycle 107 (see FIG. 5G), a motorcycle, or a similar large-sized load can be disposed in the large load space.
 Thus, it is possible to select, according to the intended use of the vehicle, between an instance in which the left rear seat 15 is removed and a large load space 106 is provided, and an instance in which the right rear seat 16 is removed and a
large load space is provided.  As a result, there is increased freedom in regard to the layout for providing a load space, and convenience can be improved.
 Next, a description will be given for a vehicle seat device 120 according to a second embodiment with reference to FIGS. 6 through 8G.  Members according to the second embodiment that are identical or similar to those in the vehicle seat device
10 according to the first embodiment are given the same numerals and a description thereof will not be provided.
 Second Embodiment
 A description will now be given for the vehicle seat device 120 according to the second embodiment.
 As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, in the vehicle seat device 120 according to the second embodiment, the reference numerals of the left and right front movement means 22, 25 according to the first embodiment have been substituted with 121, 122, and
other reference numerals are the same as those for the first embodiment.
 As shown in FIG. 7, in the left front movement means 121, the lower end part 44b of the inner left front leg part 44 and the lower end part 45b of the outer left front leg part 45 are provided on the left moving unit 92 so as to be turnable in
the longitudinal direction with respect to the vehicle body, and the upper end part 44a of the inner left front leg part 44 and the upper end part 45a of the outer left front leg part 45 are provided on the left rear seat 15 so as to be turnable in the
longitudinal direction with respect to the left rear seat 15.
 Specifically, as with the first embodiment, the lower end part 44b (i.e., the inner boss part 47) of the inner left front leg part 44 is pivotably supported between the pair of inner brackets 53 by the inner left support pin 55.  The upper end
part 44a (i.e., an inner upper boss part 124) of the inner left front leg part 44 is pivotably supported between a pair of inner upper brackets 125 by an inner upper left support pin 126.
 As with the first embodiment, the lower end part 45b (i.e., the outer boss part 48) of the outer left front leg part 45 is pivotably supported between the pair of outer brackets 57 by the outer left support pin 59.  The upper end part 45a (i.e.,
an outer upper boss part 131) of the outer left front leg part 45 is pivotably supported between a pair of outer upper brackets 132 by an outer upper left support pin 133.  The outer upper left support pin 133 and the inner upper left support pin 126 are
arranged coaxially in relation to each other.
 According to the left front movement means 121, it is possible to turn the inner and outer boss parts 47, 48 about the inner and outer left support pins 55, 59; and turn the inner and outer upper boss parts 124, 131 about the inner and outer
upper left support pins 126, 133.  The left rear seat 15 comprises the inner and outer left slide rails 38, 39 provided to a lower part of the left seat cushion 34.  It is thereby possible to tilt the left seat back 35 of the left rear seat 15 onto the
left seat cushion 34; and, in this state, swing the inner and outer left front leg parts 44, 45 forward with respect to the vehicle body and slide the left rear seat 15 forward with respect to the vehicle body using the inner and outer left slide rails
38, 39, whereby the left rear seat 15 is caused to ""dive down"" into the left foot space 17 (i.e., move in a substantially parallel manner in which the left seat back 35 of the left rear seat 15 is in a state of being disposed on top).
 The right front movement means 122 shown in FIG. 6 is bilaterally symmetrical with respect to the left front movement means 121.  As with the left front movement means 121, the right front movement means 122 is thereby able to cause the right
rear seat 16 to ""dive down"" into the right foot space 18 (i.e., move in a substantially parallel manner in which the right seat back 65 of the right rear seat 16 is in a state of being disposed on top).
 Specifically, it is possible to tilt the right seat back 65 of the right rear seat 16 onto the right seat cushion 64, and in this state, swing the inner and outer right front leg parts 74, 75 forward with respect to the vehicle body and slide
the right rear seat 16 forward with respect to the vehicle body using the inner and outer right slide rails 68, 69, whereby the right seat cushion 64 is caused to ""dive down"" into the right foot space 18.
 Next, a description will be given for an example in which the left rear seat 15 is moved into the right foot space 18 with reference to FIGS. 8A through 8G.
 As shown in FIG. 8A, the left seat back 35 of the left rear seat 15 is tilted onto the left seat cushion 34 as indicated by arrow D.
 As shown in FIG. 8B, the left seat back 35 is folded down onto the left seat cushion 34.  The left rear seat 15 having the left seat back 35 folded down can be caused to ""dive down"" (i.e., moved in a substantially parallel manner in which the
left seat back 35 of the left rear seat 15 is in a state of being disposed on top) towards the left foot space 17 as indicated by arrow E.
 As shown in FIGS. 8C and 8D, the left rear seat 15, which has been caused to ""dive down,"" is slid into the right foot space 18 using the lateral slide rail 28 as indicated by arrow F.
 As shown in FIGS. 8E and 8F, the left rear seat 15, which has been caused to ""dive down,"" is positioned in the right foot space 18.
 The inner left front leg part 44 of the left rear seat 15 extends in a state of being inclined towards the outer side with respect to the vehicle body from an upper end part 44a to a lower end part 44b.  The inner boss part 47 (i.e., the left
inner slider 95 of the left moving unit 92) is thereby positioned at substantially the center of the left rear seat 15 in the vehicle width direction.
 The inner right front leg part 74 of the right rear seat 16 extends in a state of being inclined towards the outer side with respect to the vehicle body from an upper end part 74a to a lower end part 74b.  The inner boss part 82 (i.e., the right
inner slider of the right moving unit; not shown) is thereby positioned at substantially the center of the right rear seat 16 in the vehicle width direction.
 The left inner slider 95 of the left moving unit 92 (see FIG. 7) is thereby positioned near the right inner slider of the right moving unit (not shown) when the left rear seat 15 is in a state of being arranged in the right foot space 18. 
Therefore, the left inner slider 95 of the left moving unit 92 does not obstruct the right inner slider of the right moving unit.
 As shown in FIG. 8G, moving the left rear seat 15 into the right foot space 18 makes it possible to remove the left rear seat 15 from a space 105 in which the left rear seat 15 is arranged in a seating state, or from the left foot space 17.  It
is thereby possible to combine the space 105 in which the left rear seat 15 is arranged in the seating state with the left foot space 17 to form the load space 106.  A large load space 106 can thereby be provided, and the slide door or the tail gate can
be opened and a bicycle 107, a motorcycle, or a similar large-sized load can be disposed in the large load space 106 from each of the openings.
 As with the left rear seat 15, the right rear seat 16 can be moved into the right foot space 18, and the right rear seat 16 that has moved into the right foot space 18 can be moved into the left foot space 17.  Moving the right rear seat 16 into
the left foot space 17 makes it possible to remove the right rear seat 16 from a space in which the right rear seat 16 is arranged in a seating state, or from the right foot space 18.  It is thereby possible to combine the space in which the right rear
seat 16 is arranged in the seating state and the right foot space 18.  A large load space can thereby be provided, and a bicycle 107, a motorcycle, or a similar large-sized load can be disposed in the large load space.
 Thus, it is possible to select, according to the intended use of the vehicle, between an instance in which the left rear seat 15 is removed and a large load space 106 is provided, and an instance in which the right rear seat 16 is removed and a
large load space is provided.  As a result, there is increased freedom in regard to the layout for providing a load space, and convenience can be improved.
 The vehicle seat devices 10, 120 according to the present invention are not limited to those shown in the first and the second embodiments described above, and may be modified or improved as appropriate.  For example, in the first and the second
embodiments, the lateral slide rail 28 is described as an example of the vehicle-width-direction movement means; however, the vehicle-width-direction movement means is not limited to the lateral slide rail 28.  A guide groove or other means may also be
used as the vehicle-width-direction movement means.
 The shape or configuration of the vehicle seat devices 10, 120; the vehicle body floor 11; the left second seat 15; the right second seat 16; the left foot space 17; the right foot space 18; the left front movement means 22, 121; the right front
movement means 25, 122; the lateral slide rail 28; the left front support leg 41; the right front support leg 71; and other components shown in the first and second embodiments are not limited to those shown as examples, and may be modified as
appropriate.

",,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
 The invention relates to a shading arrangement for a windshield of a rail vehicle leading car.
 Modern high-speed trains are often very problematic to darken on account of a streamlined form of the leading car and correspondingly curved windshields.  However, the high solar irradiation and the dazzling effect that occur in the case of
these windshields, which are often arranged at very shallow angles, have to be consistently inhibited on account of the decisive safety factor for a train driver.
 Hitherto, in order to shade the windshield of a leading car, use has been made of manually or electrically driven arrangements which have one, two, or even three combined fabric blinds and--at a greater or lesser distance from the
windshield--suppress the dazzling effect of the sun.  In the case of the Deutsche Bahn ICE-3 series, a sun visor was used for the first time which already had a nonlinear, curved profile.  This was achieved by corresponding articulations.  However, this
device reaches its limits very quickly, since it cannot be extended as desired with regard to movement path and windshield curvature.  In addition, the shading medium used here consists of fabric blinds, which have design-related disadvantages.  Such
disadvantages are primarily the sensitivity with respect to mechanical loads, which can lead to fraying in the edge region, wrinkling and warping of the fabric blinds.  Visual defects can also occur, for example creasing, soiling, adhesive bonding, etc.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 On this basis, the object of the invention is to provide a shading arrangement for a windshield of a leading car, in the case of which the associated sun visor extends close to the windshield, wherein in particular a given curvature of the
windshield in the longitudinal and transverse directions can be taken into account.
 In the case of the shading arrangement mentioned at the beginning, this object is achieved in that the shading arrangement has a frame structure which is provided for fastening to a roof underside of the leading car, the frame structure supports
a generally panel-like sun visor, and the sun visor is fastened in a movable manner to the frame structure by means of a guide device which has one central and two outer radial guides.
 According to the invention, no fabric blinds are thus used, but rather a generally panel-like sun visor made, for example, of GRP.  This can be moved by means of a plurality of radial guides from an initial position into a shading position. 
This obviates in particular all the design-related disadvantages of the fabric blinds known from the prior art.
 Preferably, of the three radial guides, two are configured in a fixed manner with respect to the frame structure and one is configured such that it moves conjointly with the frame structure.  In this case, the central radial guide is typically
driven, so that the sun visor can be moved between the two positions.
 Preferably, the two outer radial guides are configured in a fixed manner and the central radial guide is configured such that it moves conjointly.  The two outer radial guides can each have guide rods on which the sun visor is mounted in each
case such that its position can be adjusted.  This makes it possible to compensate if appropriate also for three-dimensional deviations in the geometry of the sun visor.
 It can be provided that, in order to orient the outer guide rods in a parallel manner, the frame structure has height-adjustable stops that act in a manner substantially perpendicular to the sun visor. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL
VIEWS OF THE DRAWING
 Exemplary embodiments of the invention are explained in more detail hereinbelow with reference to the drawings, in which:
 FIG. 1 shows a perspective view from above of a shading arrangement for a windshield of a leading car,
 FIG. 2 shows a perspective view from below of the shading arrangement in FIG. 1,
 FIG. 3 shows a detail view of a detail ""X"" from FIG. 1, and
 FIG. 4 shows a detail view of a detail ""Y"" from FIG. 1.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 FIG. 1 illustrates the general structure of a shading arrangement for a windshield of a leading car of a rail vehicle.  A sun visor 1 is supported by a frame structure 2.  The sun visor 1 is located underneath the frame structure 2 in the
illustration in FIG. 1.  In order to extend the sun visor 1, it is moved to the left in FIG. 1, while the frame structure 2 maintains its position.
 The sun visor 1 is guided with respect to the frame structure 2 with the aid of three radial guides 3, 4, 5.  Each of the radial guides 3, 4, 5 comprises an associated guide rod 6, 7, 8.
 The two outer guide rods 6, 8 are fixedly connected to the frame structure 2, with the two ends of the guide rods 6, 8 being secured to the frame structure 2 via suitable fastening devices.
 The central guide rod 7 is fixedly connected to the sun visor 1 and thus moves conjointly therewith, i.e. when the sun visor 1 is extended, the guide rod 7 moves conjointly.
 The rear end of the guide rod 7 is secured to the rear end of the sun visor 1 via a suitable fastening device.  The guide rod 7 runs from the rear edge of the sun visor 1 as far as the front edge thereof.  At the front edge of the sun visor 1,
the associated end of the guide rod 7 is likewise attached to the sun visor 1 by way of a fastening device.
 The sun visor 1 is moved between its extended and retracted positions with the aid of an electromotive drive 9.  Cable supply lines 10 are assigned to the electromotive drive 9.
 FIG. 2 shows the shading arrangement in a view from below, wherein in particular the general form of the sun visor 1 is illustrated.
 FIG. 3 shows a detail ""X"" from FIG. 1.  A stop 10 is provided in a height-adjustable manner on an associated holding portion of the frame structure 2, wherein the height adjustment is provided with the aid of suitable screw/thread units.  The
stop 10 has a bar 11 which protrudes in the direction of the outer guide rod 8 and against which an outside of the guide rod 8 comes into abutment.
 Since the two outer guide rods 6, 8 interact with corresponding stops 10, the two outer guide rods 6, 8 can be aligned in a parallel manner via the height adjustment of the stops 10.  This means that both sides of the sun visor 1 are at
approximately the same distance from the shaded windshield in the extended state.
 FIG. 4 illustrates a detail ""Y"" from FIG. 1, in particular mounting of the sun visor 1 on the outer guide rod 8.  Functionally identical mounting of the sun visor 1 on the outer guide rod 6 is also provided.
 A mounting device is constructed in a multi-part manner such that the position of a holding element 12 engaging around the outer guide rod 8 can be adjusted in three dimensions.  The holding element 12 can be displaced substantially transversely
to the sun visor 1 along a groove 13 which is provided in an intermediate element 14.  The intermediate element 14 is mounted such that it can rotate about an axis in the transverse direction of the sun visor 1, with the result that angular deflections
are possible.  The intermediate element 14 is mounted in turn within a holding ring 15.  The holding ring 15 is mounted in the body of the sun visor 1 such that it can rotate about an axis in the normal direction to the sun visor 1.  Overall, this
results in the possibility of adjusting in three dimensions the position of the holding element 12 and thus the relative position of the sun visor 1 with respect to the outer guide rod 8.  Since the same mounting is also provided for the guide rod 6, it
becomes possible for any deviations in the geometry to be taken into account by corresponding adjustment of the mountings of the sun visor 1 on the outer guide rods 6, 8.
 The central radial guide 4, in particular the central guide rod 7, which is driven in a linear manner, moves conjointly with the sun visor 1.  The central guide rod 7 is attached to the sun visor 1 via fastening elements at intervals over its
entire length.
 The outer guide rod 8 maintains its position in relation to the frame structure 2 in the retracted and extended states of the sun visor 1.  During the transition from the retracted to the extended position, the holding element 12 of the mounting
means moves forward along the guide rod 8 until an end position is reached.
 It should be emphasized that the type of structure of the shading arrangement also enables emergency unlocking which makes it possible, in the event of the on-board electrical system failing, to manually retract the sun visor 1 within a short
period of time.
 Furthermore, it is pointed out that the sun visor 1 can be produced, for example, from glass-reinforced plastic, which does not have the disadvantages mentioned at the beginning pertaining to fabric blinds and also meets very high fire
protection requirements.
 It also enables the shading arrangement to have a very small installation space height, thereby leading to an increase in the field of view of a train driver and thus contributing to an increase in safety.  The sun visor 1 is covered completely
by a roof lining when it is not being used.  Furthermore, the cockpit of the leading car has a generally more airy and roomy effect.

 1.  Field of the Invention
 This invention relates to a retractable tarp cover system for trucks, trailers, coal cars or any other pieces of equipment requiring tarps, and more particularly to a retractable tarp cover system which is moved between its retracted to extended
positions and vice versa by means of a rodless cylinder assembly at each side thereof.
 2.  Description of the Related Art
 For many years, flexible tarps have been used to cover the tops of truck or trailer bodies.  In the earliest days, the flexible tarp was extended over the upper end of the truck body with the front, rear and side edges thereof being secured to
the body by ropes or the like.  In recent years, many different types of tarp cover systems have been provided for positioning and securing a flexible tarp over the upper end of a truck or trailer body.  For example, see U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  3,942,830;
5,102,182; 5,938,270; 6,142,554; 6,481,779; and 6,582,007.
 It is believed that each of the above prior art systems suffers from certain disadvantages or shortcomings.  For example, in the crank operated tarp systems, the manual cranking of the tarp from its retracted to extended positions and vice versa
could be a strenuous task.  In the cable systems, many component parts were required with occasional failures of the pulleys, cables, etc. In the electrically operated cable systems, the pulleys, cables, etc., could fail.
 Applicant's retractable tarp cover system, as described and shown in Applicant's U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,484,789, represents a distinct improvement over the prior art systems set forth above.  The instant invention represents an improvement over the
system of U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,484,789 in that the tarp thereof may be moved the full length of the trailer without gears, cables or other mechanical parts.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
 Embodiments are described more fully below with reference to the accompanying figures, which form a part hereof and show, by way of illustration, specific exemplary embodiments.  These embodiments are disclosed in sufficient detail to enable
those skilled in the art to practice the invention.  However, embodiments may be implemented in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein.  The following detailed description is, therefore, not
to be taken in a limiting sense in that the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.
 FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional trailer such as manufactured by Aulick Industries of Scottsbluff, Nebr., which is illustrated by the reference numeral 10.  Although a trailer is illustrated, the invention described herein will work equally
well with a straight truck body, coal cars or other types of containers, or any piece of equipment requiring a tarp.  The disclosure of U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,484,789 is incorporated herein by reference thereto to complete the instant disclosure if necessary.
 Trailer 10 includes a wheeled frame means 12 having a forward end 14, a rearward end 16, and opposite sides.  Trailer 10 also includes a trailer body 18 having a forward end 20 and a rearward end 22.  Trailer body 18 also includes opposite side
walls having upper and lower ends with inner and outer sides.  The truck or trailer body 18 includes a conventional source of fluid under pressure which would normally be supplied by the prime mover.  The source of fluid under pressure may be hydraulic
oil or air.  The source of pressurized fluid will be described in more detail in the schematic of FIG. 7.
 The retractable tarp cover system of this invention is referred to generally by the reference numeral 24 which includes a flexible tarp 26.  The tarp 26 is comprised of a flexible material such as parachute material or the like.  The forward or
front end of the tarp 26 is secured to the forward end of the trailer body 18 so that the tarp 26 may be moved between retracted and extended positions with the side edges thereof disposed adjacent the upper ends of the side walls of the trailer body 18.
 The numeral 28 refers to a first, elongated and horizontally disposed support member, having a front end 30 and a rear end 32 which is positioned at the first side of the truck body 18 at the outer side thereof adjacent the upper end thereof. 
Although the drawings illustrate that the support member 28 is tubular in cross-section, it could also be square in cross-section, rectangular in cross-section, octagonal, etc. The forward end or front end of support member 28 is secured to the side wall
of the trailer body 18 by bracket 34 having a cap 36 secured thereto which closes the front end of the support member 28.  Cap member 36 includes a central opening 38 formed therein as will be described in more detail hereinafter.  The rear end of the
support member 28 is secured to the side wall of the truck body 18 by a bracket 40 having a cap member 42 secured thereto which closes the rearward end of the support member 28.  Cap member 42 has a central opening 44 formed therein as will be described
in more detail hereinafter.  The numeral 46 refers to a cylindrical inner permanent magnet piston having alternating rows of North and South magnets.  For purposes of description, the piston 46 will be described as having a front end 48 and a rear end
50.
 The numeral 52 refers to an elongated and horizontally disposed second support member having a front end 54 and a rear end 56.  Although the support member 52 is shown to be tubular in shape, the support member 52 could have a square cross
section or a rectangular cross-section.  The support member 52 is secured to the other side of the trailer body at the upper end thereof in the same manner as the support member 28 is secured to the other side of the trailer body.  A cap member 58 closes
the front end 54 of support member 52 and has an opening 60 formed therein.  Cap member 62 closes the rear end of support member 52 and has an opening 64 formed therein.  The numeral 66 refers to a cylindrical inner permanent magnet piston having
alternating rows of North and South magnets.  For purposes of description, the piston 66 will be described as having a front end 68 and a rear end 70.
 The numeral 72 refers to truck bows which have collars 74 and 76 at the opposite ends thereof which are longitudinally movable on the support members 28 and 52 respectively.  The tarp 26 is secured to the tarp bows 72 in the same manner as
disclosed in Applicant's earlier patent.  The rearward most collar 74R includes a ring-shaped outer permanent magnet 78 therein while the rearward most collar 76R includes a ring-shaped outer permanent magnet 80 therein which is identical to the magnet
78.  The collars 74R and 76R are positioned over the pistons 46 and 66 respectively and are magnetically connected thereto.
 The numeral 82 refers to a source of pressurized fluid such as air or oil.  The numeral 84 refers to a control valve.  An inlet fluid conduit 86 extends from source 82 to control valve 84.  A fluid return line or conduit 88 extends from control
valve 84 to source 82.  Fluid conduit 90 extends from control valve 84 to fluid conduit 92 which extends to opening 38 in cap member 36 in support member 28 and to opening 60 in cap member 58 in support member 52.  Fluid conduit 94 extends from control
valve 84 to fluid conduit 96 which extends to opening 44 in cap member 42 of support member 28 and to opening 64 in cap member 62 in support member 58.
 Thus, when control valve 84 discharges fluid through conduit 90 into conduit 92, the pressurized fluid will enter the front ends of support members 28 and 52 to move the pistons 46 and 66 rearwardly in support members 28 and 52 which will cause
the outer magnets 76 and 80 to move rearwardly in support members 28 and 52 which causes tarp bow 72R to move rearwardly with respect to support members 28 and 52 thereby causing the tarp 26 to move to is extended position over the upper end of the truck
body (FIG. 1).  At that same time, the fluid which is at the rearward side of the pistons 46 and 66 in support members 28 and 52 will return to source 82 by way of lines 96, 94 and 88.
 When it is desired to retract the tarp 26, control valve 84 is actuated so that pressurized fluid is discharged therefrom through lines 94 and 96 into opening 44 in cap member 42 in support member 28 and into opening 64 in cap member 62 of
support member 52 so that the pistons 46 and 66 will move forwardly in support members 28 and 52 which causes tarp bow 72R to move forwardly on support members 28 and 52.  The forward movement of tarp bow 72R pushes the tarp bows 72 forwardly to retract
the tarp 26.  As the pistons 46 and 62 are moved forwardly in support members 28 and 52 respectively, the fluid at the forward sides of the pistons 46 and 66 will be returned to source 82 by way of lines 92, 90 and 88.
 Thus it can be seen that the invention accomplishes at least all of its stated objectives.
 Although the invention has been described in language that is specific to certain structures and methodological steps, it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific structures
and/or steps described.  Rather, the specific aspects and steps are described as forms of implementing the claimed invention.  Since many embodiments of the invention can be practiced without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, the
invention resides in the claims hereinafter appended.

 This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C.  Section 119 to Italian Patent Application Serial No. B02010A 000147, filed on Mar.  11, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
 The present subject matter relates to a vehicle provided with a convertible top.
BACKGROUND
 In particular, the present subject matter relates to a vehicle provided with a body, a passenger compartment enclosed by the body and delimited at the front by a windscreen enclosed by a U-shaped frame, and a convertible roof, which can be
connected to the body for closing the passenger compartment at the top and in turn comprises a covering canvas and a supporting frame that can be mechanically connected to the body and supports the covering canvas.
 This type of two-seater sports vehicles, better known as ""roadsters"" or also ""spyders"", are increasingly widespread on the automotive market in Europe and above all in the United States.  For its characteristics, the vehicle described above is
particularly widespread in those areas that are characterized by sunny days and high temperatures for a fair share of the year.
 The convertible roof can be made of canvas or else of metal or plastic.  In the case where the vehicle is provided with a convertible roof made of canvas, the latter is usually housed within a purposely provided compartment made in the body and
set outside the passenger compartment.
 In the event of wet weather, an occupant of the vehicle has to extract the folded convertible roof from the purposely provided compartment and connect it to the body to close the passenger compartment at the top.  The operations to be carried
out in order to connect the convertible roof to the body may require a few minutes and can be particularly complex in the case where just one person has to carry out the operations.
 For example, the document U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,283,531 regards a road vehicle comprising a body, a passenger compartment enclosed by the body and delimited at the front by a windscreen supported by a U-shaped frame, and a hard-top roof, which can
be connected to the body for closing the passenger compartment at the top and comprises a rigid top wall and a pair of rigid side panels, made of a single piece with the top wall, for closing the passenger compartment at the sides.  Moreover provided are
front engagement means for connecting the top wall to the U-shaped frame, and rear engagement means for connecting the two side panels to a portion of the body that delimits the passenger compartment at the rear.  A convertible roof made according to
U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,283,531 is excessively cumbersome, and the operations to be carried out for connecting the convertible roof to the body may be complex in the case where just one person has to carry out the operations.
 The document No. DE10120358 describes, instead, a road vehicle comprising a body, a passenger compartment enclosed by the body and delimited at the front by a windscreen supported by a U-shaped frame, and a convertible roof, which can be
connected to the body for closing the passenger compartment at the top and in turn comprises a covering canvas that is substantially horizontal in the position for closing the passenger compartment.  The roof then comprises two side members that can be
mechanically connected to the body so as to support the covering canvas.  Each side member comprises a rigid side panel that rises in cantilever fashion from a rear end of the side member and, in the position for closing the passenger compartment, is set
substantially vertical and perpendicular to the covering canvas, and engagement means for connecting the covering canvas to the frame of the windscreen and for connecting the two side panels to a portion of the body that delimits the passenger
compartment at the rear and at the sides.  The covering canvas at its side ends is inserted within respective guides made in the two side members and slides within these guides until it reaches the frame of the windscreen; it follows that the operations
to be carried out for connecting the convertible roof to the body may be complex and burdensome in terms of time in the case where just one person has to carry out the operations.
SUMMARY
 Examples of the present subject matter provide a vehicle equipped with a convertible roof, said roof being free from the drawbacks of the prior art, being light, of small overall dimensions, and easy and inexpensive to produce, and at the same
time enabling easy connection thereof to the vehicle in the case where just one person has to carry out the operation.
 According to examples of the present subject matter, a vehicle equipped with a convertible roof is provided according to what is claimed in the annexed claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 In FIG. 1, designated as a whole by 1, is a road vehicle comprising a coachwork 2 and an interior compartment 3.  The interior compartment 3 is enclosed internally by the coachwork 2, is completely uncovered, and is delimited or bordered at the
front by a windscreen 4 enclosed by a U-shaped frame 5.  Housed inside the interior compartment 3 are two seats 6 for accommodating two occupants.
 The two seats 6 are protected at the rear by a protection structure 7, better known as ""roll-bar structure"" 7, which is designed to protect the occupants of the vehicle 1 in the case where the vehicle 1 turns over and must be able to withstand
the weight of the vehicle 1 without breaking.
 The coachwork 2 of the vehicle is pre-arranged for being connected to a convertible roof 8, which is designed to define a position for closing the interior compartment 3 (illustrated in FIG. 7) in which the entire interior compartment 3 is
covered by the convertible roof 8 itself.
 When the vehicle 1 is travelling with the interior compartment 3 uncovered, the convertible roof 8 is housed in a purposely provided compartment 9.  The compartment 9 for housing the convertible roof 8 is made in the coachwork 2, in a central
position behind the interior compartment 3 and is closed by a cover, which, in the closing position, sets itself flush with the rest of the coachwork 2.  In an alternative embodiment (not illustrated), the function of cover of the compartment 9 is
performed directly by the boot lid.
 According to what is illustrated in FIG. 3, the convertible roof 8 comprises a plane transparent panel 10, which is set substantially vertical (or with appropriate inclination so as not to generate any troublesome reflections on the internal
rearview mirror of the vehicle 1) and defines a rear window 10 of the interior compartment 3, made of single-layer or multi-layer glass or else of some other transparent material and preferably supported by a frame.
 The convertible roof 8 then comprises a covering cloth 11 and a supporting frame 12, which is designed to support the covering cloth 11 and can be mechanically connected to the coachwork 2.  In particular, the supporting frame 12 is designed to
provide a connection structure between the two ends of the interior compartment 3, namely, between the roll-bar structure 7 and the frame 5 of the windscreen 4.
 According to what is illustrated in FIG. 3, the supporting frame 12 comprises a rear cross member 13, which can be connected to a top edge of the rear window 9, and two arched portions, designated by 14 and 14', which have a relatively small
thickness and are hinged to respective ends of the cross member 13 at a rear end thereof.  In a position of opening of the supporting frame 12, the two arched portions 14 and 14' are instead set in a direction substantially orthogonal to the cross member
13 and are coupled to the U-shaped frame 5 of the windscreen 4.  The top cross member 15 of the frame 5 has in fact two seats 16 and 16' (better illustrated in FIG. 2) made for housing a free front end of a respective arched portion 14, 14', which, in
order to engage the seats 16 and 16', undergoes a slight deformation so as to be arched upwards.
 The cloth 11 is rolled up inside the compartment 9 in order to reduce the encumbrance as much as possible; after extraction, it is rested on the two arched portions 14 and 14' and unrolled so as to set itself substantially horizontal.
 As is illustrated more clearly in FIG. 4, the covering cloth 11 is substantially horizontal in the position of closing of the interior compartment 3 and has two side beams 17 at respective ends.  The two side beams 17 carry connected thereto two
side panels 18, at a rear end thereof.  The side beams 17, together with the arched portions 14 and 14', concur in defining the profile of the covering cloth 11 in the position of connection with the coachwork 2.
 The two side panels 18 have an arched profile and are set perpendicular to the covering cloth 11 itself so as to be substantially vertical in the position for closing the interior compartment 3.  Finally, the two side panels 18 are connected to
the coachwork 2 at their free ends.  The bottom edge of each side beam 17 and the internal edge of a respective side panel 18 concur also in defining the continuous profile of a seat (not illustrated) designed to receive a respective side window (not
illustrated) of the vehicle 1 with the interposition of purposely provided weatherproofing (not illustrated).
 The vehicle 1 then comprises engagement means 19 for connecting the convertible roof 8 to the coachwork 2 in order to determine the position for closing the interior compartment 3.  The engagement means 19 are divided into: front engagement
means 19A for front connection of the side beam 17 to the U-shaped frame 5 of the windscreen 4; and rear engagement means 19B for connection of the side member 16 and of the side panel 18 to the rear portion of the coachwork 2 located immediately behind
the interior compartment 3.
 The front engagement means 19A comprise a pair of pins, designated respectively by and 20 and 21, which project from a front surface 22 of a respective side beam 17 and extend towards the U-shaped frame 5 of the windscreen 4.
 The two pins 20 and 21 have respective axes substantially parallel to one another.
 The pin 20 is fixed and set more internally, i.e., towards the center of the covering cloth 11 and towards the other side beam 17'.  The pin 20 co-operates with a respective slot 23, made in the top cross member 15 of the U-shaped frame of the
windscreen.  The slot 23 (better illustrated in FIG. 2) has in cross section a width such as to enable easy insertion of the corresponding fixed pin 20 by the occupant of the vehicle 1.  The slot 23 for insertion of the fixed pin 20 has a profile that
does not coincide with the ideal path of extraction of the pin itself, designated by Ts in FIG. 5.  The profile of the slot 23 has been made in this way to prevent the fixed pivot pin 20 from possibly sliding out of the corresponding slot 23 in an
undesirable way.
 The pin 21 is set more externally, i.e., towards the outside of the coachwork 2.  The pin 21 is mobile along the axis between a retracted position, in which the pin 21 disappears within the side beam 17, and an advanced position of insertion, in
which the pin 21 projects from the front surface 22 of the side member towards the U-shaped frame 5 of the front windscreen 4.
 The pin 21 co-operates with a respective slot 24, which is also made in the top cross member 15 of the U-shaped frame 5 of the windscreen 4.  The slot 24 has in cross section a width such as to enable easy insertion of the corresponding pin 21
by the occupant of the vehicle 1.  The slot 24 in which the pin is inserted has a profile that coincides with the ideal path of insertion of the corresponding pin 21, designated by Ti in FIG. 5.  In other words, the profile of the slot 24 has been made
in this way for facilitating insertion of the pin 21.
 Actuation of the mobile pin 21 from the advanced position of insertion to the retracted position and vice versa is controlled by a handle 25, which projects from the side beam 17 downwards within the interior compartment 3.
 According to a variant, the two pins 20 and 21 have mushroom-shaped heads so as to compensate for the dimensional tolerances and recover any possible play in the longitudinal direction.
 According to a first variant, the mobile pin 21 and the handle are made of a single piece, and a central portion is embedded within the side beam 17.
 According to a second variant, the mobile pin 21 and the handle 25 are not made of a single piece, but rather are connected via a flexible cable, which is embedded within the side beam 17.
 In use, after the occupant has unrolled the covering cloth 11, the occupant inserts the fixed pin 20 into the respective slot 23.  At this point, the side beam 17 performs a rotation about the axis of the fixed pin 20.  The mobile pin 21 follows
the path Ti of insertion during rotation of the side beam 17.  The occupant must act on the actuation handle 25 to bring the mobile pin 21 into the retracted position in such a way that, during insertion, the pin 21 itself does not interfere with the
respective slot 24.  Once rotation has been completed and the pin 21 is inserted in the slot 24, the occupant can release the actuation handle 25 to enable the mobile pin 21 to set itself in the advanced position.
 The front engagement means 19A further comprise a hook 26, which is connected to a front edge of the covering cloth 11.  The hook 26 is set approximately in the median point of the covering cloth 11.  In this way, when the convertible roof 8 is
connected to the coachwork 2 of the vehicle 1, the hook 26 is located between the two arched portions 14 and 14'.  The hook 26 is substantially U shaped so as to hook into a groove 27 made in the top cross member 15 of the U-shaped frame 5 of the
windscreen 4.
 The rear engagement means 19B comprise an appendage 28 that projects from the inner surface of the side panel 18 at a top end thereof and extends towards the inside of the interior compartment 3.  The appendage 28 co-operates with a respective
seat 29, made in a rear portion of the coachwork 2 and, in particular, on the roll-bar structure 7.  According to a variant, the seat 29 is substantially shaped like an H in plan view.
 The rear engagement means 19B then comprise a pair of mobile pins, designated respectively by 30 and 30*, which are connected to a bottom surface of a respective side panel 18 and extend downwards, i.e., towards the coachwork 2.
 The two mobile pins 30, 30* have respective axes substantially parallel to one another and are set substantially at respective bottom ends of the side panel 18.
 Each mobile pin 30, 30* co-operates with a respective slot 31, 31* made in a portion of the coachwork 2 that delimits the interior compartment 3 at the sides.  Each slot 31, 31* has a width such as to enable easy insertion of the corresponding
pin 30, 30* by the occupant of the vehicle 1.
 Each pin 30, 30* is mobile along a respective axis between a retracted position, in which the pin 30, 30* disappears within the side panel 18, and an advanced position of insertion, in which the pin 30, 30* projects from the side panel 18
towards the coachwork 2 from the bottom surface of the side panel 18 itself.
 Actuation of the pins 30, 30* from the advanced position of insertion to the retracted position and vice versa is controlled by a handle 32, which is set within the side member and projects partially downwards within the interior compartment 3.
 The mobile pins 30, 30* are controlled by the same actuation handle 32 so as to render connection of the covering cloth 11 to the coachwork 2 more convenient.  The handle 32 and the mobile pins 30, 30* are not made of a single piece, but rather
are connected via respective flexible cables 33, which are embedded partially within the side beam 17 and partially within the side panel 18.
 The covering cloth 11 comprises a covering strip, which is applied along the front and rear perimetral edges of the covering cloth 11 (i.e., in a position corresponding to the top cross member 15 of the frame 5 and to the cross member 13 of the
supporting frame 12).  The strip is applied with interposition of a tensioning wire, which is applied along the front and rear perimetral edges of the covering cloth 11 and is moreover connected to the two side beams 17, 17'.
 In use, as described previously, the side beam 17 performs a rotation, describing the path about the axis of the pin 20.  Simultaneously with insertion of the pin 20 in the respective slot 23, the occupant engages the appendage 28 in the seat
29.  Once this step is completed, the occupant must act on the actuation handle 32 so as to bring the two mobile pins 30, 30* into the retracted position.  In this way, during connection of the side panels 18, the mobile pins 30, 30* of each side panel
18 do not interfere with the rest of the coachwork 2.  Once rotation about the axis has been completed, and the pins 30, 30* are in the retracted position and each of them faces the respective slot 31, 31*, the occupant can release the actuation handle
32 to enable the mobile pins 30, 30* to set themselves in the advanced position and engage the respective slot 31, 31*.
 Rotation of the side beam 17 about the axis of the pin 20 brings about tensioning of the tensioning wire.  The covering strip applied along the front and rear perimetral edges of the covering cloth 11 is also tensioned by the action of the wire;
in this way, the covering strip adheres perfectly to the top cross member 15 of the frame 5 and to the cross member 13 of the supporting frame 12 so as to close the interior compartment 3 hermetically.
 According to a variant, the side panel 18 has a plane transparent insert 34, which is made of single-layer or multi-layer glass or else of some other transparent material.  The insert 34 may present shapes other than the crescent shape
represented in FIG. 7.  The insert 34 guarantees the driver of the vehicle 1 a good lateral visibility and affords a lighter styling of the vehicle 1.
 According to a variant (not illustrated), the convertible roof 8 is not provided with the supporting frame 12.  A plurality of (preferably three) stiffening cross members are integrated directly in the covering cloth 11.  The covering cloth 11
is moreover provided with weatherproofing strips along its own front and rear perimetral edges to prevent any infiltration of water into the interior compartment 3.
 FIGS. 8 to 11 illustrate a first improvement, provided according to the teachings of the present subject matter, of the known convertible roof 8 of FIGS. 3 to 7.  In FIGS. 8 to 11, corresponding parts of the various embodiments are designated,
where possible, by the same reference numbers as the ones used in FIGS. 3 to 7.
 The embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 8 to 11 differs from the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 3 to 7 in that the convertible roof 8' illustrated in FIGS. 8 to 11 comprises a rigid covering cloth 11' and a pair of side beams 17', separated from
the rigid covering cloth 11' (only one of which will be described in detail in the ensuing treatment), and in that the convertible roof 8 does not comprise the supporting frame 12.
 The rigid covering cloth 11' basically consists of a carbon-fiber panel 35, which, when it is not in use, is set within a compartment (not illustrated) made immediately behind the seats 6 in the interior compartment 3 in order to reduce the
encumbrance as much as possible.  The panel 35 is set substantially horizontal in the position for closing the interior compartment 3.  Since the supporting frame 12 is not envisaged, the rigid covering cloth 11' comprises a pair of weatherproofing
strips set at a front perimetral edge and a rear perimetral edge of the panel 35 and such as to be located, in use, respectively between the panel 35 and the rear window 10 and between the panel 35 and the U-shaped frame 5 of the windscreen 4.
 The roof 8' then comprises the two side beams 17' that carry two side panels 18' connected thereto, at a rear end thereof.
 The two side panels 18' have an arched profile and are set perpendicular to the rigid covering cloth 11' itself so as to be substantially vertical in the position for closing the interior compartment 3.  The bottom edge of each side beam 17' and
the internal edge of a respective side panel 18' concur also in defining the continuous profile of a seat (not illustrated) designed to receive a respective side window (not illustrated) of the vehicle 1 with the interposition of purposely provided
weatherproofing strips (not illustrated).  According to a variant, the side panel 18' has a plane transparent insert 34', which is made of single-layer or multi-layer glass or else of some other transparent material and is designed to guarantee the
driver of the vehicle 1 a good lateral visibility and provide a lighter styling of the vehicle 1.
 The vehicle 1 then comprises engagement means 19' for connecting the convertible roof 8' to the coachwork 2 in order to determine the position for closing the interior compartment 3.  The engagement means 19' are divided into: front engagement
means 19A' for front connection of a respective side beam 17' to the U-shaped frame 5 of the windscreen 4; and rear engagement means 19B' for connection of the side beam 17' and of the side panel 18' to the rear portion of the coachwork 2 that is set
immediately behind the interior compartment 3.
 Actuation of the front engagement means 19A' from an advanced position to a retracted position and vice versa is controlled by a handle 25', which projects from the side beam 17' and extends within the interior compartment 3.
 The front engagement means 19A' further comprise a hook 26', which is set in the proximity of a front edge of the rigid covering cloth 11' (i.e., of the carbon-fiber panel 34).  The hook 26' is set approximately in the median point of the rigid
covering cloth 11'.  The hook 26' is designed to couple with a purposely provided groove made in the top cross member 15 of the U-shaped frame 5 of the windscreen 4.
 The rear engagement means 19B' then comprise mobile pins connected to a bottom surface of the side panel 18', which extend downwards, i.e., towards the coachwork 2.  Actuation of the rear engagement means 19B' from an advanced position to a
retracted position and vice versa is controlled by a handle 32'.
 The convertible roof 8' then comprises means 36 for connection of the rigid covering cloth 11' to the two side beams 17'.  In particular, the rigid covering cloth 11' comprises top connection means 36A, which are connected to a bottom surface of
the panel 35, extend towards the inside of the interior compartment 3, and are uniformly distributed throughout the width of the panel 35.  In addition, the top connection means 36A are set at side ends of the panel 35, in particular in the proximity of
the side perimetral edges for coupling with the side beams 17'.  The top connection means 36A comprise two pins 37 of a relatively small length and a hook element 38 set between the two pins 37.
 The top connection means 36A co-operate with the bottom connection means 36B of the side beam 17', which are connected to an inner surface of the side beam 17' and extend towards the inside of the interior compartment 3.  The bottom connection
means 36B comprise two flat elements 39, each of which is provided with a respective through hole 40, and a pin 41 set between the two flat elements 39.  In use, the two pins engage a respective through hole 40 made in the flat element 39, and the hook
element 38 co-operates with the pin 41 to bring about clamping of the panel 35 on the side beams 17'.
 In use, the occupant first engages the front engagement means 19A to the U-shaped frame 5 of the windscreen 4.  At this point, the side beam 17' performs a rotation until it enables engagement of the rear engagement means 19B to the portion of
the coachwork 2 that delimits the interior compartment 3 at the side and at the rear.  Once both of the side beams 17' have been connected to the coachwork 2, the occupant can block the rigid covering cloth 11' on the side beams 17' in such a way as to
close the interior compartment 3 completely and hermetically.
 According to a further variant (not illustrated), the convertible roof 8'' comprises both a soft covering cloth 11*, which connects the two side beams 17'', and a rigid covering cloth 11**.  According to this variant, assembly of the ensemble
constituted by the soft covering cloth 11* and the side beams 17'' is performed in a way altogether similar to what has been described in the foregoing treatment.  Once the ensemble has been connected to the coachwork 2, the occupant can block the rigid
covering cloth 11** on the side beams 17'' in such a way as to close the interior compartment 3 completely and hermetically.
 The embodiments of the convertible roof 8, 8' so far described present certain advantages in so far as they present a small encumbrance and a styling perfectly compatible with the styling of the vehicle 1.  In addition, the convertible roof 8,
8' can be conveniently connected to the coachwork 2 also in the case where the vehicle 1 is occupied by just one person, who will by himself be able to carry out in a short time all the necessary operations in sequence.

 The present invention relates to a vehicle window section structure.
BACKGROUND ART
 Heretofore, there have been known vehicles in which a small window, or a so-called opera window or quarter window, is arranged in the vicinity of a corner portion between a front portion of a front pillar and the upper surface of a rear end
portion of a front fender, as disclosed in Japanese Examined Utility Model Registration Application Publication No. Hei 6(1994)-25375, for example.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
 However, in the window section structure described in Japanese Examined Utility Model Registration Application Publication No. Hei 6-25375 mentioned above, a molding is arranged along the outer periphery of the small window, and with the door
closed, a gap is formed between the molding and the sash (window frame) of the door.  Thus, traveling wind may possibly enter the gap and generate a wind noise while the vehicle is traveling.
 In this respect, the present invention provides a vehicle window section structure capable of efficiently reducing a wind noise generated in the vicinity of a small window.
 A vehicle window section structure according to the present invention includes: a small window provided on a vehicle body side; a lip provided on an outer periphery of the small window and extending inward in a vehicle width direction; and a
door mirror mount provided to an openable and closable door and disposed facing the lip in a state where the door is closed.  A gap extending inward in the vehicle width direction is formed between the lip and the door mirror mount, and, in the gap,
distance between the lip and the door mirror mount is large at an outer end in the vehicle width direction and smaller at an inner end in the vehicle width direction than at the outer end in the vehicle width direction.
 In the vehicle window section structure according to the present invention, the lip and the door mirror mount disposed facing the lip are formed such that the cross-sectional width therebetween is larger toward the outer end in the vehicle width
direction and smaller toward the inner end in the vehicle width direction.  Thus, as traveling wind that occurs when the vehicle travels enters the gap between the lip and the door mirror mount, the flow speed of the traveling wind gradually decreases
and the pressure thereof increases.  Accordingly, it is possible to efficiently reduce the wind noise by the traveling wind. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
 Hereinbelow, an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail along with the drawings.
 As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, in a front section of a vehicle 1, a pair of front pillars 3 extending obliquely upward toward the rear of the vehicle are arranged on both left and right sides of the vehicle body.  A windshield 5 is arranged along
the vehicle width direction between the pair of front pillars 3 and 3.
 Moreover, a front fender 7 is arranged below a front side of each front pillar 3.  A small window 9 called an opera window is fixed to the vehicle body side at a corner section which is generally triangular in a side view and defined by the
front pillar 3 and the front fender 7.  Specifically, the small window 9 is mounted to the vehicle body side through a peripheral member 11 arranged along the outer periphery thereof.
 Meanwhile, a front door (door) 13 is provided openably and closably on a rear side of the front fender 7 and small window 9 in the vehicle.  The front door 13 includes: a door body 15 disposed in a lower portion; a window frame 17 disposed above
the door body 15; a door mirror mount 19 provided on a front portion of the door body 15; and a door mirror 21 mounted to the door body 15 through the door mirror mount 19.  A door glass 23 is provided in the window frame 17 in such a way as to be
capable of being raised and lowered.  Note that the door mirror mount 19 is integrally formed of a mount body 25 mounted to the door body 15 and a mirror base 27 projecting from the mount body 25 toward the outer side of the vehicle (outward in the
vehicle width direction).  The door mirror 21 is supported turnably on the mirror base 27.
 As shown in FIG. 3, the front pillar 3 is formed to have a closed sectional structure by an outer panel 29, an inner panel 31, and a reinforcement panel 33.  In a rear end portion of the front pillar 3, a flange portion 35 is formed which
extends in the vehicle front-rear direction.  Moreover, in an area corresponding to a rear end portion of the small window 9, a holding member 41 is arranged which is formed to have a closed sectional structure by an outer panel 37, an inner panel 39,
and a reinforcement panel 40.  In a front end portion of the holding member 41, a flange portion 45 is formed which extends toward the trout of the vehicle.
 In addition, the small window 9 is arranged between the flange portion 35 of the front pillar 3 and the flange portion 45 of the holding member 41.  Specifically, the peripheral member 11 is joined to and along the outer periphery of the small
window 9.  Contact rubber 47 projecting toward the inner side of the vehicle (inward in the vehicle width direction) is provided on the back surface of the peripheral member 11.  The contact rubber 47 is bonded to the flange portion 35 of the front
pillar 3 and the flange portion 45 of the holding member 41 by means of adhesive.
 Moreover, a rear portion of the peripheral member 11 of the small window 9, which extends from a point P through a point Q to a point R as shown in FIG. 1, is integrally formed of a holding surface 49 extending along and bonded to the back
surface of the small window 9, a lip 50 extending from the outer periphery of the holding surface 49 toward the inner side of the vehicle, and the contact rubber 47 provided on the holding surface 49, as shown in FIG. 3.
 In addition, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, in an area from the point Q to the point R in FIG. 1, the mount body 25 forming the door mirror mount 19 includes: an outer member 51 disposed on the outer side of the vehicle; an inner member 53 disposed
on the inner side of the vehicle; and a middle member 55 disposed between the outer member 51 and the inner member 53.  Moreover, the lip 50 formed integrally in the peripheral member 11 extends substantially straight from a root portion 57 disposed in
an end portion of the lip 50 on the outer side of the vehicle to a bent portion 59 and then bends at the bent portion 59 toward the outer periphery of the peripheral member 11 (downward) and extends therefrom straight to a projecting portion 61 at a tip
portion of the lip 50.  In addition, the lip 50 is formed such that its thickness decreases as it gets closer from the root portion 57 through the bent portion 59 to the projecting portion 61, that is, as at gets closer to the inner side in the vehicle
width direction.  Note that the projecting portion 61 disposed at the tip portion is formed in an arc shape in cross section and projects outward toward the inner member 53 of the mount body 25.
 As a result, the lip 50 and the mount body 25 define a predetermined gap 63 therebetween in a state where the front door 13 is closed.  Specifically, the root portion 57 of the lip 50 and the outer member 51 of the mount body 25 define an inlet
portion 65 of the gap 63.  The lip 50 around the bent portion 59 and the middle member 55 define a middle portion 67 of the gap 63.  The projecting portion 61 of the lip 50 and the inner member 53 define an outlet portion 69.  In addition, the gap 63 is
formed such that its cross-sectional width is largest at the inlet portion 65, decreases gradually as it gets closer to the middle portion 67, and is smallest at the outlet portion 69.  In other words, the lip 50 and the mount body 25 facing the lip 50
are formed such that the distance therebetween is largest at the outer end in the vehicle width direction and smallest at the inner end in the vehicle width direction.
 Now, Bernoulli's principle will be described briefly.
 In general, when a fluid flows, the sum of potential energy by the height from a reference plane, kinetic energy by the speed, and pressure energy remains constant.  In a case of traveling wind in this embodiment, changes in the potential energy
are negligible, and therefore the sum of the kinetic energy (dynamic pressure) and the pressure energy (static pressure) of the traveling wind is constant.  Accordingly, (1/2).rho.v.sup.2+p=(constant), where v is the flow speed of the traveling wind in
its flow direction, .rho.  is the density, and p is the pressure.
 In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 6, as traveling wind W that occurs when the vehicle travels enters the gap 63, it enters the gap 63 from the inlet portion 65 to the middle portion 67.  The traveling wind W then slightly changes its flow at
the middle portion 67 toward the outer periphery of the lip 50 and thereafter flows to the outlet portion 69.  Here, the outlet portion 69 is where the cross-sectional width of the gap 63 is smallest, in other words, a stagnation point.  Thus, the flow
of the traveling wind W substantially stops, and the kinetic energy (dynamic pressure) becomes substantially zero.  For this reason, at the outlet portion 69 of the gap 63, almost all the energy of the traveling wind W, which is a fluid, is the pressure
energy (static energy).  Accordingly, the projecting portion 61 functions as a noise reduction wall, making it possible to significantly reduce the wind noise by the traveling wind W.
 Meanwhile, from a comparison between a present invention example with the above-described lip 50 being provided and a comparative example without the lip 50 being provided, it was found that the noise level was lower for the present invention
example in a range above a frequency of 1000 Hz, as shown in FIG. 7.  Further, from a comparison between the present invention example and the comparative example in terms of articulation index (AI value) during travel of the vehicle, it was found that
the present invention example was improved over the comparative example by approximately 3.
 Note that while the contact rubber 47 is used in this embodiment, only adhesive may be used instead of the contact rubber 47 to bond the flange portion 35 of the front pillar 3 and the flange portion 45 of the holding member 41.
 Hereinbelow, operations and effects of this embodiment will be described.
 (1) In the vehicle window section structure according to this embodiment, the lip 50 and the mount body 25 of the door mirror mount 19 disposed facing the lip 50 are formed such that the distance therebetween is larger toward the outer end in
the vehicle width direction and smaller toward the inner end in the vehicle width direction.  Thus, as the traveling wind W that occurs when the vehicle travels enters the gap 63 between the lip 50 and the mount body 25, the flow speed of the traveling
wind W decreases gradually and becomes smallest at the outlet portion 69 of the gap 63 and the pressure of the traveling wind W becomes largest there, due to Bernoulli's principle described above.  Accordingly, the wind noise by the traveling wind W can
be reduced efficiently.
 (2) The projecting portion 61 projecting toward the mount body 25 of the door mirror mount 19 is provided at the inner end, in the vehicle width direction, of the lip 50.  Accordingly, it is possible to minimize the cross-sectional width of the
outlet portion 69 of the gap 63 by means of a simple structure and to improve the rigidity of the lip 50 as well.  Incidentally, since the lip 50 is disposed at an outer side, in the vehicle width direction, of the holding member 41, the holding member
41 is hidden when one sees the gap 63 from the outer side of the vehicle.  Accordingly, the external appearance is improved.
 (3) The lip 50 is formed such that its thickness decreases as it gets closer to the inner side in the vehicle width direction.  Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the weight of the lip 50 as a whole.
 (4) The peripheral member 11 is provided along the outer periphery of the small window 9, the small window 9 is mounted to the vehicle body side through the peripheral member 11, and the lip 50 is formed integrally with the peripheral member 11. Accordingly, it is possible to improve the holding stiffness of the lip 50 and to eliminate man-hours in mounting the lip 50 in a separate step.
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
 According to the present invention, as traveling wind that occurs when the vehicle travels enters the gap between the lip and the door mirror mount, the flow speed of the traveling wind gradually decreases and the pressure thereof increases. 
Accordingly, it is possible to efficiently reduce the wind noise by the traveling wind.

 This invention relates to an improvement in the aerodynamic characteristics of vehicles.  More specifically, this invention relates to an air deflection apparatus for box-shaped land transportation vehicles, such as trucks and the like, which
provides a reduction in the aerodynamic drag that normally results from the movement of such vehicles through the air at various speeds.  Even more specifically, this invention relates to at least one retractable air deflection element, which may be
disposed adjacent the angular trailing corner edge(s) of a box-shaped vehicle body, and which, in the preferred embodiment, can assume at least three positions: a closed or retracted position, which provides a modicum of aerodynamic drag reduction, a
deployed position providing additional aerodynamic drag reduction for travel at low and moderate speeds, and an extended deployed position providing aerodynamic drag reduction for travel at high speeds.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Fuel consumption is a major operating cost for trucking and other forms of transportation.  As fuel costs have risen, the expense of fuel has become an increasingly important component in the operating expenses associated with transportation,
and as such it has become a factor that affects the profitability of individual transportation companies and of the transportation industry generally.
 Most trucks and other heavy land-based transport vehicles have boxy shapes which are inefficient aerodynamically, and therefore, when such a vehicle travels over a route at normal operating speeds, air flow resistance at the front of the
vehicle, which tends to increase headwind or frontal pressure, and drag-producing air flow phenomena at the rear and along the sides of the vehicle, which tend to decrease trailing air pressure and to increase friction, combine to retard the forward
movement of the vehicle and have always been major factors in wasted fuel economy.  Specifically, in order to maintain a chosen speed, additional engine power is required to overcome the air flow resistance and drag produced by these phenomena, which in
turn leads to the consumption of more fuel.  As the speed of the vehicle increases, the effects produced by these phenomena can increase geometrically, such that at high operating speeds, most of the energy expended by the vehicle is consumed in
overcoming these phenomena.
 Several solutions to the problem of air flow resistance at the front of such a vehicle have been proposed, most of which alter the configuration and thereby ""streamline"" the front of the vehicle in some way so as to reduce the air flow
resistance, and some of these proposals have even been implemented commercially.  This frontal streamlining reduces the headwind, or front end pressure, but does nothing to address the similar but distinct problems caused by the air flow phenomena which
produce drag, and which originate behind, or at or near the rear of such a vehicle, along its top and sides, to which the prior art has paid little attention.
 This drag results from two distinct factors, one of which is an area of low pressure or partial vacuum that develops behind the vehicle as it travels forward, and into which surrounding air is drawn.  This area of low pressure further retards
the forward movement of the vehicle, because it amplifies the effect of the air flow resistance at the front of the vehicle (mentioned above) by increasing still further the pressure differential or pressure gradient between the front and rear of the
vehicle.  For a conventional box-shaped, tractor-trailer type of vehicle, a substantial counteracting force is required to overcome the increase in the pressure gradient caused by the trailing area of low pressure.  This counteracting force, which can
only be provided via the expenditure of additional fuel by the vehicle's engine, is a major component of the total fuel consumed by such a tractor-trailer operating at highway speeds.
 The other factor that results in drag is due to an increase in friction arising from the disruption in laminar air flow longitudinally along the sides and along the top of a box-shaped vehicle as it progresses through the air along its forward
path.  This disruption is characterized by eddies and turbulence that develop behind and along the top and sides of the vehicle as the laminar flow breaks down.  When traveling at slower speeds, the breakdown ""boundary,"" i.e., the point at which this
effect is manifested, is located towards the rear of the vehicle, but as the speed increases, the breakdown boundary generally migrates forward, thus increasing the amount of friction experienced by the vehicle.  The precise location of the breakdown
boundary will vary not only with the speed of the vehicle, but also with variations in the shape of the vehicle body, as well as with ambient wind speed and direction, and other weather conditions.  However, the first areas of such a vehicle that are
affected by the breakdown in laminar flow are the top and sides, at or near the respective trailing edges.
 A few solutions to the problems associated with drag have been proposed, but some of them have been directed primarily toward the breakdown in laminar flow along the top and sides of the vehicle, while others have been directed primarily toward
reducing the area of low pressure at the rear of a vehicle.  For example, it is known to provide hinged side and roof extenders at the trailing edges of a truck body, or at the trailing edges of the trailer of a tractor-trailer, which can reduce drag to
some degree.
 Such solutions are exemplified by U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,485,087 to Roberge et al. However, the hinged panels of Roberge et al. are flat or planar, rather than curved, and they are attached to the hinged pair of rear cargo doors which form a portion
of the rear-facing surface of the vehicle; thus, they are caused to retract only when those cargo doors are opened, and they cannot be used with vehicles that employ a single, ""roll-up"" rear cargo door (rather than a pair of swinging cargo doors), since
no means to access such a unitary door (or the cargo inside) is provided.  Moreover, these panels, which primarily provide for an improved laminar flow by altering the shape, i.e., by streamlining, the rear side and upper rear edges of the trailer, do
not directly address the problem of reduced trailing pressure, and therefore do not divert the air sufficiently to alleviate the area of low pressure behind the vehicle (although a modest diversion or deflection of the airstream does occur as the air is
""bent"" slightly around the panels).  As a result, the solution proposed by Roberge et al. functions best only at higher operating speeds, since it does not provide for ""scooping"" or ""ducting"" of the air, which is desirable at lower operating speeds in
order to reduce the trailing low pressure behind the vehicle as well as to improve the laminar flow along the top and sides of the vehicle.
 On the other hand, while U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,280,990 to Rinard does provide curved, vertically-oriented side deflection vanes (as well as horizontally-oriented transverse upper and lower deflection ducts, which act to ""scoop"" or divert at right
angles the air flow above, below and along the sides of the vehicle, and which are therefore primarily directed towards reducing the area of low pressure behind the vehicle), Rinard's air diversion elements do not directly address the additional drag
caused by the breakdown in laminar flow along the top and sides of the vehicle (although a slight improvement in the laminar flow does occur simply by virtue of the reduction in the trailing low pressure that these elements do provide).  Nevertheless,
and in contrast to Roberge et al., the solution proposed by Rinard works well to reduce drag only at lower operating speeds, but does not work well at higher operating speeds, when there is more of a need for the airstream to be diverted from the
trailing top and side surfaces by flowing over the air diversion elements, rather than being ""ducted"" under and/or through them.  In fact, at higher speeds Rinard's solution not only becomes less effective, it actually becomes counter-effective as the
vehicle speed increases, because as the airflow that is ""ducted"" through these elements increases, they eventually become aerodynamically resistive.
 In addition, Rinard's side deflector vanes, like the planar panels of Roberge et al., are attached to the hinged pair of rear cargo doors which form a portion of the rear-facing surface of the vehicle, and although they can be displaced from
their deployed position, this can be done only when the cargo doors of the trailer are opened, and even then, Rinard's side deflector vanes cannot be retracted to a fully flush position.  Moreover, Rinard's deflector vanes are mounted with spring-biased
means that act to return the deflector vanes to their deployed positions automatically (as soon as the cargo doors have been closed).  Thus, while these deflector vanes need not be directly deployed and retracted manually in order to provide access to
the cargo doors, they nevertheless remain deployed unless and until the cargo doors are actually opened, and accordingly, they are susceptible to damage when the vehicle is being maneuvered into a narrow loading dock, and/or they can interfere with the
driver's ability to monitor road conditions behind the vehicle, especially when it is being operated on local streets or otherwise at slow (i.e., non-highway) speeds, or when it is being backed into a loading dock, or when it is being parked.
 Furthermore, during high speed travel the instabilities resulting from the breakdown in the laminar airflow along the top and sides of the vehicle are likely to cause rapid oscillation of Rinard's side deflector vanes (despite their
spring-biased mounting means), possibly resulting in those deflector vanes being damaged or, more likely, being forced by the unstable airflow into a ""closed"" position flush with the trailing edges of the vehicle body (completely overcoming the bias of
the springs), and thereby making the vanes utterly ineffective to perform their intended air diversion or ""scooping"" function.  Finally, Rinard's side deflector vanes, although arcuate in shape, are not contoured so as to optimize aerodynamic
performance, and they can assume only one deployed position, which cannot be varied dynamically while the vehicle is traveling.
 Thus, although the prior art appears to have recognized that the trailing upper (and, to a smaller degree, lower) edge of a box-shaped vehicle would create low pressure behind the rear of the vehicle when it is in motion, the prior art has
failed to address that low pressure problem while also addressing the problems that arise from the simultaneous disruption of laminar flow along the top and sides of a vehicle.  The prior art has also failed to recognize that the magnitude of each of
these problems, both absolutely and relative to one other, and the nature of their most effective solutions, will vary according to the speed of the vehicle, and the prior art has failed address these problems in a manner that can not only dynamically
adjust, but can also optimize, those solutions as the speed changes.
 While the drag problems resulting from the trailing low pressure and disruption of laminar flow described above are particularly acute for cargo-carrying vehicles which travel over highways and other paved or unpaved roads, such as conventional
tractor-trailers and other box-shaped trucks, and even squared-off passenger-carrying vehicles such as buses and sport-utility vehicles, they can also afflict other large land-based conveyances, particularly combination or ""tandem"" tractor-trailer
assemblies comprising two or even three box-shaped trailers, and even a succession of adjacent, squared-off railroad cars (regardless of whether those rail cars are used for carrying passengers or freight).
 In the latter cases, in which there are multiple box-shaped container units, additional airflow inefficiencies are created, due to the breakdown in laminar flow in between the units caused by the gaps between the adjacent container bodies, which
the prior art has also failed to address.  In fact, the prior art solutions, as exemplified by the Rinard and Roberge et al. patents mentioned above, even if attached to the rear-facing surfaces of the leading (and/or an intermediate) trailer of a
""tandem"" tractor-trailer assembly, or to the rear-facing surfaces of the leading (or one of the intermediate) cars of a succession of box-shaped railroad cars, would have no effect, since any attempt to divert air into the relatively confined space
between the adjacent container bodies, where the air pressure is not reduced to any significant degree in any event, will be ineffective because of back pressure.  Moreover, Rinard's deflectors might actually have an undesirable, negative effect in this
""tandem"" context, since they will actually foster a breakdown in laminar flow at lower speeds than would otherwise be the case if those deflectors were not present, thus actually reducing, rather than improving, aerodynamic efficiency at any given speed.
 Another related factor which can affect vehicle performance, and therefore fuel consumption, is the airflow both over and under the vehicle, as it moves along its route at high speeds.  Since the air moving over the top of the vehicle often has
to travel further than the air moving underneath the vehicle, a lift component is exerted on the vehicle body in accordance with Bernoulli's Principle, which tends to destabilize the vehicle.  Moreover, for road vehicles such as tractor-trailers
traveling at highway speeds, certain weather-related road conditions, such as those created by rain, can enhance this instability and increase the potential for ""jack-knifing"" when braking is needed.  The prior art, as exemplified by the Rinard and
Roberge et al. patents mentioned above, has failed to address the lift problem attributable to the Bernoulli effect in the same context as the problems created by the air flow phenomena which produce drag.
 In summary, the prior art has failed to provide a solution that satisfactorily ameliorates all of the components of trailing drag which develop at or near the rear of a box-shaped vehicle, both behind it and along its top and sides, as it moves
forward at normal operating speeds.  Moreover, and particularly for road vehicles, the prior art has failed to provide such a solution which at the same time does not hinder or obstruct the driver's view of the area surrounding the rear of such a vehicle
when it is being operated at slower and maneuvering speeds, and does not interfere with access to, or with the opening and closing of, the rear cargo door(s) which could unduly prolong loading and/or unloading operations at a conventional loading dock. 
Furthermore, and again particularly for road vehicles such as tractor-trailers and other box-shaped trucks, the prior art has failed to provide such a solution which also helps to overcome the lifting force encountered at highway speeds.  Finally, the
prior art has failed to appreciate that any measures used to counteract the aerodynamic inefficiencies that plague box-shaped vehicles must account for the fact that these aerodynamic instabilities, as well as the effectiveness of the countermeasures,
will vary as the speed of the vehicle changes.
 Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide an air deflection apparatus for box-shaped land transportation vehicles which can reduce both the drag associated with the area of low pressure which develops behind such
a vehicle, and the drag associated with the breakdown of the laminar air flow along the top and sides of such a vehicle, as it moves forward at normal operating speeds.
 Another object of the present invention is to provide an air deflection apparatus for box-shaped land transportation vehicles which can reduce both of the major components of drag which develop along the top and sides and behind the rear of such
a vehicle when it is being operated at high speeds, and which is adjustable in a dynamic fashion so as to vary the aerodynamic effects and thereby optimize the economic benefits thereof, depending upon the speed at which the vehicle is traveling.
 An additional object of the present invention is to provide an air deflection apparatus for box-shaped land transportation vehicles which can reduce both of the major components of drag which develop along the top and sides and behind the rear
of such a vehicle when it is being operated at high speeds, but which does not interfere with the opening and closing of the rear cargo door(s) or with cargo loading and/or unloading operations, at a conventional loading dock or otherwise, when the
vehicle is stationary.
 It is also an object of the present invention to provide an air deflection apparatus for box-shaped land transportation vehicles which can reduce both of the major components of drag which develop along the top and sides and behind the rear of
such a vehicle when it is being operated at high speeds, but which does not obstruct the driver's view of the area surrounding the rear of such a vehicle when it is being operated at slower and maneuvering speeds, or when it is stationary.
 Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an air deflection apparatus for box-shaped land transportation vehicles which can reduce both of the major components of drag which develop along the top and sides and behind the rear of
such a vehicle when it is being operated at high speeds, and which can also reduce the additional airflow inefficiencies that are caused by the gaps between the adjacent container bodies in vehicles having multiple successive box-shaped container units.
 It is an added object of the present invention to provide an air deflection apparatus for box-shaped land transportation vehicles which can reduce both of the major components of drag which develop along the top and sides and behind the rear of
such a vehicle when it is being operated at high speeds, and which can be used to the same advantage regardless of whether the vehicle employs a pair of hinged swinging rear cargo doors, or a unitary, roll-up rear cargo door.
 A further object of the present invention is to provide an air deflection apparatus for box-shaped land transportation vehicles which can reduce both of the major components of drag which develop along the top and sides and behind the rear of
such a vehicle when it is being operated at high speeds, and which can also counteract the lifting force normally encountered by such vehicles at such speeds.
 A still further object of the present invention is to provide an air deflection apparatus for box-shaped land transportation vehicles which can reduce both of the major components of drag which develop along the top and sides and behind the rear
of such a vehicle when it is being operated at high speeds, which can easily be retro-fitted to existing vehicles or which can be included as original equipment in newly-manufactured vehicles.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 These and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing a drag-reducing apparatus for a box-shaped land transportation vehicle comprising, in certain embodiments, at least one air deflection element which is preferably curved
(i.e., non-planar) and which is coupled to the outer surface of the vehicle but not necessarily to the rear-facing surface of that vehicle; more preferably, the apparatus comprises at least three air deflection elements, each of which is contoured in a
wing-like shape, and each of which is disposed adjacent one of the angular trailing corner edges of the vehicle, most preferably with one disposed transversely across the upper trailing corner edge of the vehicle, and two disposed vertically, one along
each of the side trailing corner edges of the vehicle.
 Each of the air deflection elements is displaceable, and preferably all of the air deflection elements are displaceable in unison, between a retracted position and at least one air flow diverting, deployed position, but more preferably, the
position of each of the air deflection elements is variable over a continuous range of positions, from a fully retracted position, through one or more deployed positions, to a fully extended deployed position, and most preferably, these movements of the
air deflection elements are power-assisted and can be controlled remotely.  The air deflection elements are coupled to the vehicle body in such a manner as to allow them to be moved to any position within the range of positions described above, and
optionally in at least two embodiments, also to allow the trailing edge of the air deflection element mounted transversely across the upper rear corner edge of the vehicle to be extended upward, relative to its leading edge.
 For vehicles in which the rear-facing surface comprises one or more doors allowing access to the interior of the vehicle for, e.g., loading or unloading of cargo, the air deflection elements are not coupled to these cargo doors, and therefore
the deployment and retraction of the air deflection elements is independent of the position or movement of these cargo doors.  As a result, the air deflection elements are capable of assuming a fully retracted position when these cargo doors need to be
opened, but they do not automatically assume a deployed position once (i.e., they can remain in or assume the retracted position even when) the cargo doors of the vehicle are closed.  Preferably, the air deflection elements are deployed only when the
vehicle is in motion, and only to the extent necessary to optimize the aerodynamic drag reduction for the speed at which the vehicle is traveling, with the fully extended deployed position being utilized when the vehicle is moving at or close to its
normally high operating speed.  However, due to their aerodynamic shape, the air deflection elements can be effective, in certain embodiments, to counteract the breakdown in laminar flow along the top and sides of the vehicle, even when in their fully
retracted position.
 It is therefore one aspect of the present invention that when the vehicle is moving and the air deflection elements are deployed, both the drag associated with the area of low pressure which develops behind the vehicle, and the drag associated
with the breakdown of the laminar air flow along the top and sides of the vehicle, are reduced as the air deflection elements divert the airflow from the trailing top and side surfaces of the vehicle.
 It is another aspect of the present invention that when the vehicle is moving and the air deflection elements are not deployed, the air deflection elements may in certain configurations still provide some aerodynamic benefit, since the drag
associated with the breakdown of the laminar air flow along the top and sides of the vehicle will be at least moderately reduced by the partial diversion of the airflow from the trailing top and side surfaces of the vehicle, thereby reducing turbulence
by helping to at least partially re-establish laminar flow.
 It is a feature of the present invention that the positions assumed by the air deflection elements can be changed dynamically, as the speed of the vehicle changes, in order to optimize their aerodynamic benefits in reducing drag.
 It is another feature of the present invention that, depending upon the extent of deployment or the air deflection elements, the airflow along the top and sides of the vehicle can sometimes be diverted by being ""ducted"" or ""scooped"" by the inner
surface of each air deflection element, and in other instances the airflow along the top and sides of the vehicle can be diverted by being ""bent"" over and around the outer surface of each air deflection element, while in still other instances the airflow
can be diverted in both of these ways, thus utilizing both the inner and outer surfaces of each air deflection element simultaneously, so as to divert the airflow into the area behind the vehicle and thereby reduce in all cases the drag associated with
the area of low pressure which develops behind the vehicle.
 It is yet another feature of the present invention that the air deflection elements, when in their fully retracted positions, do not interfere with the opening and closing of the rear cargo door(s) of the vehicle or with cargo loading and/or
unloading operations, regardless of whether the vehicle employs a pair of hinged swinging rear cargo doors or a unitary roll-up rear cargo door, nor do they impede the driver's view of the area surrounding the rear of the vehicle when it is being
operated at slower and maneuvering speeds, or when it is stationary.
 It is a further feature of the present invention that it can be used for aerodynamic benefit to reduce the airflow inefficiencies that result from the turbulence introduced by the gaps between the adjacent container bodies in vehicles having
multiple successive box-shaped container units.
 It is still another feature of the present invention that at least one of the air deflection elements can optionally also be used to counteract lift. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views.  The most preferred
embodiment of the invention is illustrated in FIGS. 1-11A, and referring initially to FIGS. 1 and 2, which depict a representative vehicular environment in which the apparatus of the invention might be used, a retractable air deflection apparatus in
accordance with the present invention is generally designated 10.
 The illustrative vehicular environment for the invention comprises a typical 5-axle, 18-wheel tractor-trailer 12, having a tractor or cab 14 and an attached trailer 16.  As is conventional in the transportation industry, trailer 16 encloses a
volume that is fundamentally a rectangular parallelopiped, and trailer 16 is therefore similarly shaped (that shape may also be characterized herein as ""box-shaped"" or ""squared off""), having an upper surface 18, a left side surface 20, a right side
surface (not shown in the drawings), a front-facing surface (also not shown in the drawings), a rear-facing surface 22 having an opening that is closed by a pair of slightly recessed, hinged, swinging rear cargo doors 24, 26 for access to the interior of
trailer 16, an upper trailing corner edge 28, a left side trailing corner edge 30, a right side trailing corner edge 32, a lower trailing corner edge 34.  Trailer 16 also has a plurality of electrically-energized marker lights 35 located at various
positions on rear-facing surface 22, several of which are customarily aligned transversely across the upper portion of rear-facing surface 22, substantially parallel to and just below the upper trailing corner edge 28 of trailer 16, and above the cargo
doors 24, 26, as shown illustratively in FIGS. 1 and 2.
 Air deflection apparatus 10 comprises at least one, preferably a plurality, and most preferably at least three, air deflection elements 36, each of which is preferably fabricated of aircraft grade aluminum ranging in thickness from 1/8'' to
3/16'', although other materials which are also opaque, such as other metals, plastics, composites and/or materials fabricated from or with the synthetic fibers marketed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, of Wilmington, Del., U.S.A.  under the
trademark KEVLAR, may be appropriate as well.  However, if it is desired to fabricate the air deflection elements of a transparent material, then any appropriate transparent material including an acrylic plastic material or a UV-stabilized, synthetic
polycarbonate resinous sheet material, such as that marketed by General Electric Company of Schenectady, N.Y., U.S.A.  and/or Pittsfield, Mass., U.S.A.  under the trademark LEXAN, may be used instead, although in such case the polycarbonate sheet
material will preferably be no less than 3/16'' thick and no greater than 1/4'' thick.
 FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate the most preferred embodiment of the invention, in which one air deflection element 36a is installed transversely across the upper surface 18 of trailer 16, adjacent and substantially parallel to the upper trailing
corner edge 28 and preferably extending horizontally across the entire width of trailer 16, substantially from corner to corner, and two air deflection elements 36b and 36c are installed vertically, on the left side surface 20 of trailer 16, adjacent and
substantially parallel to the left side trailing corner edge 30, and on the right side surface, adjacent and substantially parallel to the opposite, right side trailing corner edge 32, respectively, with these two air deflection elements extending
vertically and preferably spanning the overall height of the vehicle, also substantially from corner to corner.
 Thus, for a typical long-haul vehicle such as the tractor-trailer 12 depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, having a trailer 16 that ranges in width from about eight feet to about nine feet and ranges in internal height from about seven feet, six inches to
about ten feet, air deflection element 36a will preferably have a transverse or lengthwise dimension ranging from about eight feet to about nine feet, while air deflection elements 36b and 36c will both preferably have a lengthwise dimension (vertical,
in these cases) ranging from about seven feet, six inches to about ten feet.  However, it is to be understood that the two side air deflection elements 36b and 36c will not only be substantially identical to one another but except for their lengths will
be substantially identical to upper air deflection element 36a as well.  Thus, it will be evident to those skilled in the art that much of what is described hereinafter with respect to upper air deflection element 36a will apply as well, mutatis
mutandis, to left side air deflection element 36b and to right side air deflection element 36c.
 Since the air deflection elements of the present invention are not intended to provide lift (as with an aircraft wing) or thrust (as with a propeller, the blades of which often have wing-like shapes in cross-section), but are intended instead to
divert and vector the airflow along the top and sides of a box-shaped, moving body with which they are in very close proximity, much of the conventional research and analysis that has contributed to the well-developed compendium of knowledge constituting
the modern art of wing and/or ""airfoil"" design is irrelevant to the design of the air deflection elements for use with this invention.  Nevertheless, some of the terminology normally associated with simple wing geometry is also useful in describing the
shape of the air deflection elements preferred for use with the invention.
 Referring now to FIGS. 3-11A in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1 and 2, each air deflection element 36 has a shape that is ""non-symmetric"" as that term is understood in the airfoil art, in that the upper and lower surfaces are not
identical ""mirror-images"" of one another; in fact, when the air deflection elements of the present invention are considered as airfoils, the lower surface of the airfoil is preferably located above, rather than below, the chord of the airfoil, and the
lower surface may sometimes even share the same curvature as the upper surface, as is illustrated in the drawings with respect to upper air deflection element 36a in the cross-sectional views of FIGS. 3, 8 and 11.
 The optimum shape, i.e., the exact mathematical specifications for the optimum geometry, of an air deflection element that may be utilized in the present invention will vary depending upon the size and shape of the vehicle on which it is
mounted, and therefore, wind tunnel testing may be required in order to determine a range of those specifications with precision for each different class of vehicle with which the invention will be used (the optimum shape will vary depending on
environmental factors as well, but since the latter generally do not remain constant for long periods of time, and can change rapidly, and since it would be time-consuming, cumbersome and impractical, once air deflection elements having a particular
shape are installed on a particular vehicle, to interchange them with air deflection elements having a different shape, so as to utilize the optimum shape as each different set of environmental conditions is encountered, these environmental factors must
essentially be ignored when determining the optimum air deflection element shapes for different classes of vehicles).
 Nevertheless, the air deflection elements of the present invention will have a number of common characteristics which can be described here, regardless of the class of vehicle with which they are used.  For example, each air deflection element
36 comprises a leading edge 38 and a trailing edge 40, and each air deflection element is dimensioned to extend widthwise, from its leading edge to its trailing edge (i.e., along its chord, when considered as an airfoil), for a distance which is
dependent on the length of the box-shaped portion of the vehicle on which it is mounted, and which typically ranges from approximately one percent to approximately five percent thereof, more preferably from approximately two percent to approximately four
percent thereof, and most preferably approximately three percent, thereof.  Thus, for a typical long-haul vehicle such as tractor-trailer 12, having a trailer with an overall length of approximately fifty-three feet (as measured from its front-facing
surface to its rear-facing surface 22), each air deflection element 36 will preferably measure between one and two feet, from its leading edge 38 to its trailing edge 40; most preferably, each air deflection element 36 will be approximately eighteen
inches wide.
 Aside from their non-symmetric design and their chord lengths, the air deflection elements for use with the present invention will have other characteristics in common, although these characteristics are not illustrated in the drawings.  For
example, unless the air deflection element has a constant thickness, the curvature of the upper surface will typically be somewhat greater than the curvature of the lower surface, and therefore, although the thickness of each air deflection element (the
distance between its upper surface and its lower surface) will normally be relatively small, that thickness will not be constant at all points along the air deflection element (from its leading edge to its trailing edge).  In addition, the maximum camber
(expressed as a percentage of the chord length) will typically range from approximately four percent to approximately ten percent, while the position of the maximum camber (also expressed as a percentage of the chord length) will typically range from
approximately twenty-five percent to approximately fifty percent.  Furthermore, the maximum thickness (again expressed as a percentage of the chord length) will typically range from approximately three-tenths of one percent to approximately six percent,
while the position of the maximum thickness (expressed yet again as a percentage of the chord length) will typically range from approximately twenty-five percent to approximately ninety percent.  Moreover, rather than a conventional curved leading edge
that can be mathematically defined by a radius of curvature, each air deflection element will have a relatively ""flat"" or ""smooth"" leading edge that is flush with the vehicle body when the air deflection element is completely retracted; this structure
minimizes the disruption of the airflow and reduces turbulence at the leading edge.  Finally, the trailing edge of the air deflection element may also optionally have a reflex extension (which will be described in further detail hereinafter).
 The foregoing common characteristics will, when taken together, define a group or ""family"" of air deflection element shapes that will be acceptable for use with this most preferred embodiment of the present invention.  The shape of the air
deflection element illustrated in FIGS. 3-11A of the drawings falls within that family, but it is to be understood that many other shapes would satisfy the criteria expressed above and would also be acceptable for use with the present invention.  In
general, airfoil shapes are often symbolized by ""NACA"" numbers (which were devised during the twentieth century by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, a precursor of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in order to represent
aircraft wing shapes), and the ""modified"" four-digit NACA numbers (also known as the NACA.sub.4-2 numbers) which correspond to the shape illustrated in FIGS. 3-11A (when the air deflection element is considered as an airfoil) are 9401-01 and/or 9401-11,
although it is to be understood that due to their inherent imprecision, each such NACA number actually corresponds to a range or ""sub-family"" of airfoil shapes.  Those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that since, as set forth above, the
preferred width (from leading edge to trailing edge) of each air deflection element for use with the present invention will vary depending on the length of the box-shaped portion of the vehicle on which it is mounted, the NACA number (the various
components of which are expressed as percentages of the chord length) therefore may not remain constant from one vehicular environment to another, even if essentially the same geometry is being utilized in both of those vehicular environments.
 The following modified four-digit NACA numbers correspond to other exemplary air deflection element shapes that will be acceptable for use in this most preferred embodiment of the present invention: 4402-08, 4402-18, 5404-04, 5404-14, 7404-04,
7404-14, 8403-04, 8403-14, 8405-04 and 8405-14.  It will be understood by those skilled in the art, however, that unlike the shape illustrated in FIGS. 3-11A, which is formed from, and the thickness of which corresponds to the thickness of, a single
sheet or ""skin"" of the fabricating material (aircraft aluminum or one of the synthetic materials mentioned above), with the thickness remaining constant from just behind its leading edge all the way to its trailing edge, the NACA numbers set forth in the
previous sentence represent airfoil shapes in which that thickness does not remain constant, i.e., the inner surface has a curvature that is different from the curvature of the outer surface.  In such cases, the air deflection element may either be
manufactured from two separate segments or ""skins"" of the fabricating material, which are independently shaped and are then joined to form an air deflection element that has an inner wall, an outer wall, and a generally hollow interior, an example of
which will be described hereinafter, or it may be manufactured from a single piece of the fabricating material which is shaped so as to form surfaces with differing curvatures, resulting an air deflection element of varying thickness but with a solid
interior (not shown in the drawings).
 Referring once again to the drawings, each air deflection element 36 preferably also comprises end walls 43, and although the air deflection elements 36 may be coupled directly to the vehicle body, via a plurality of pivotable, arm-like support
struts (as will be described in further detail hereinafter), each air deflection element 36 is preferably associated with a stationary mounting plate 42 (as shown best in FIG. 3) to which those struts are coupled.  Mounting plate 42 is also preferably
fabricated of aircraft grade aluminum, and comprises a flat base portion 44, a tail portion 46 disposed at a right angle to the base portion 44, and as shown best in FIG. 3A, a curved nose portion 48.
 The span of nose portion 48, as represented by the double-headed arrow A in FIG. 3A, is preferably chosen so that its rear edge is disposed adjacent to and meets with the forward edge 38a of air deflection element 36, when the latter is in the
fully retracted position shown in FIGS. 3 and 3A, such that nose portion 48 essentially becomes an integral part of air deflection element 36, with nose portion 48 forming the leading edge 38 of air deflection element 36 and ""completing"" its shape. 
However, when air deflection element 36 is deployed, nose portion 48 of mounting plate 42 does not deploy with it, and instead remains in place as an extension of the vehicle body, functioning as an air-deflecting wind dam.
 Alternatively, however, as shown in FIGS. 3B and 3C, mounting plate 42 may be formed without a nose portion 48, and air deflection element 36 may instead be provided with an flexible, tapering extension 48'.  Preferably, extension 48' is
fabricated of the synthetic fibers marketed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Del., U.S.A.  under the trademark KEVLAR, although other materials having similar characteristics may be used instead.  Extension 48' preferably overlaps,
and is attached in a permanent fashion to, the forward portion of air deflection element 36 and thereby forms its leading edge 38.  As shown in FIG. 3B, extension 48' may be affixed to air deflection element 36 via adhesive, and as will be apparent to
those skilled in the art, extension 48' remains a part of air deflection element 36, and deploys with it.
 Base portion 44 and tail portion 46 of mounting plate 42 are disposed adjacent and flush to the vehicle body, and may be affixed to the vehicle body in any secure fashion (not shown) that is well known to those skilled in the art.  Although the
mounting plate 42 may be affixed to the vehicle body in a permanent fashion, more preferably it will be removable, either so as to allow air deflection apparatus 10 to be ""shared"" among different active vehicles of the same size (e.g., in a ""drop and
swap"" trailer environment), or so as to allow air deflection apparatus 10 to continue to be used on a newer vehicle when the older vehicle on which it was initially installed goes out of service, in either case thereby maximizing the useful life of air
deflection apparatus 10.
 For purposes of illustration, FIG. 3 shows the mounting plate 42 associated with upper air deflection element 36a.  There, the base portion 44 of mounting plate 42 is shown flush with, and as affixed to, the upper surface 18 of trailer 16. 
However, it is to be understood that the two side air deflection elements 36b and 36c may each be associated with a similar mounting plate 42, which comprises a flat base portion 44, a tail portion 46 disposed at a right angle to the base portion 44 and
a curved nose portion 48, and that the base portions 44 of the mounting plates 42 associated with the left side air deflection element 36b and associated with the right side air deflection element 36c are positioned flush with, and are affixed
respectively to, the left side surface 20 of trailer 16 and the right side surface of trailer 16, in a similar secure, but preferably removable, fashion.
 Each air deflection element 36 preferably is supported, and is also coupled, either to the vehicle body itself, or to a mounting plate 42 (and thereby to the vehicle body), but in any event not to the vehicle's rear cargo doors, by a plurality
of pivotable, arm-like struts, referred to hereinafter as ""pivot arms,"" which preferably are also fabricated of aircraft grade aluminum, and which preferably allow air deflection element 36 to be displaced (as will be described hereinafter) between a
retracted position and at least one air flow diverting, deployed position, but which most preferably allow the position of air deflection element 36 to vary over a continuous range of positions, from a fully retracted position (as shown in FIG. 3),
through a number of deployed positions (an illustrative two of which are shown in FIG. 8, one in solid lines and one in phantom lines, and an illustrative one of which is shown in phantom lines in FIG. 11), to a fully-extended deployed position (as shown
in solid lines in FIG. 11).
 Each air deflection element 36 is supported by a plurality of leading or front pivot arms 50, as well as by a plurality of trailing or rear pivot arms 52, each front pivot arm 50 having a distal end 50a and a proximal end 50b, and each rear
pivot arm 52 having a distal end 52a and a proximal end 52b.  The number of front pivot arms 50 will vary depending upon the stresses to which the air deflection element is expected to be subjected, although for almost all situations, a total of four
front pivot arms 50, preferably disposed along the longitudinal extent of each air deflection element 36, symmetrically on either side of the imaginary center line (not shown in the drawings) of that air deflection element, will be sufficient to provide
the necessary stability, and most preferably with an inner pair of those front pivot arms 50 being clustered more closely together, adjacent to and on either side of that center line, for linkage with drive components (to be described hereinafter) that
are positioned substantially along that center line, in between that pair of front pivot arms, as shown most clearly in FIG. 4; that inner pair of front pivot arms will hereinafter sometimes be referred to as the driven pair of front pivot arms.
 The number of rear pivot arms 52, will vary depending upon the size of the vehicle body on which the air deflection elements are mounted.  For larger and/or taller vehicles, of which the long-haul tractor-trailer 12 depicted in FIG. 1 is
representative, preferably there are a total of four rear pivot arms 52 which are substantially equally spaced along the longitudinal extent of each air deflection element 36, and most preferably with an inner pair of those rear pivot arms 52 being
clustered more closely together, adjacent to and on either side of the imaginary center line of that air deflection element, as shown most clearly in FIG. 4; that inner pair of rear pivot arms will hereinafter sometimes be referred to as the central pair
of rear pivot arms.  For smaller or shorter vehicles, such as medium-haul box trucks, a total of only three rear pivot arms will normally suffice to provide the needed support, and for even smaller and/or shorter vehicles, such as short-haul vans and
panel trucks, a total of only two rear pivot arms 52 will typically suffice, but in all of these cases the rear pivot arms will similarly be disposed along the longitudinal extent of each air deflection element 36, symmetrically on either side of the
imaginary center line of the air deflection element.
 Each front pivot arm 50 may be coupled by any suitable means to air deflection element 36 at a point near its forward edge 38a.  Illustratively, as shown best in FIG. 8, at distal end 50a each front pivot arm 50 carries a projection 54, while
the under surface 56 of air deflection element 36 carries an associated leading projection, preferably comprising an angle bracket 58; the projection 54 and the angle bracket 58 are pierced, and each projection 54 is rotatably coupled to an associated
angle bracket 58 in a conventional fashion via a hinge pin 60.  As shown best in FIGS. 3A and 3B, each projection 54 is oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal axis of its respective front pivot arm 50, such that substantially a right or ninety-degree
angle 55 is formed, and as shown most clearly in FIG. 8, each front pivot arm also 50 tapers, i.e., narrows slightly in height, along its longitudinal axis, from proximal end 50b towards distal end 50a and projection 54.  In addition, as shown in FIG.
3A, each air deflection element 36 is provided, near its forward edge 38a, with a plurality of slot-like openings 61, each opening 61 accommodating the projection 54 on one of the front pivot arms 50 when the air deflection element 36 is in the fully
retracted position, as depicted in FIG. 3 for upper air deflection element 36a; similarly, in the alternative structure depicted in FIGS. 3B and 3C, the extension 48' on each air deflection element 36 is provided with a plurality of slot-like openings
61', each opening 61' accommodating the projection 54 on one of the front pivot arms 50 when the air deflection element 36 is in the fully retracted position, as depicted in FIG. 3 for upper air deflection element 36a.
 Preferably, in order to resist lateral (long axis) flexure of air deflection element 36 between the points of attachment of all of the front pivot arms 50, a portion 62 of air deflection element 36 that surrounds each point of attachment, and
that extends longitudinally along the air deflection element so as to encompass all of those points of attachment, will be reinforced.  The reinforcement must be strong enough to allow the moving force transmitted to air deflection element 36 by the
driven front pivot arms, via their points of attachment, in the manner to be described hereinafter, to be distributed longitudinally to the other (non-driven) front pivot arms via their respective points of attachment, especially when the air deflection
element 36 is being displaced from a deployed position towards the fully retracted position while the vehicle is moving.  Most preferably, this reinforcement will comprise a stiffening ridge of aircraft aluminum (not shown), positioned on the under
surface 56 of air deflection element 36.
 Each rear pivot arm 52 may be coupled by any suitable means to air deflection element 36 at a point approximately midway between the forward edge 38a and the trailing edge 40 of the air deflection element.  Illustratively, as shown best in FIG.
3, each rear pivot arm 52 is pierced adjacent its distal end 52a, while the under surface 56 of air deflection element 36 carries an associated trailing projection, preferably comprising an angle bracket 64, which is also pierced and which is rotatably
coupled to rear pivot arm 52 adjacent distal end 52a in a conventional fashion via a hinge pin 66.
 Preferably, in order to resist lateral (long axis) flexure of air deflection element 36 between the points of attachment of all of the rear pivot arms 52, a portion 68 of air deflection element 36 that surrounds each point of attachment, and
that extends longitudinally along the air deflection element so as to encompass all of those points of attachment, will be reinforced as well.  Most preferably, this reinforcement will comprise a plurality of stiffening ridges of aircraft aluminum (not
shown), positioned on the under surface 56 of air deflection element 36, and will extend laterally (i.e., toward the leading edge 38 and toward the trailing edge 40) for several inches surrounding each point of attachment.
 The front pivot arms 50 and the rear pivot arms 52 may also be coupled, at their respective proximal ends, to mounting plate 42 (and thereby to the vehicle body) by any suitable means.  Illustratively, as shown best in FIGS. 3-5 and 8, at
proximal end 50b each front pivot arm 50 is pierced, while the base portion 44 of mounting plate 42 is provided with a plurality of projecting angle brackets 70, each of which is also pierced and is rotatably coupled in a conventional fashion via a hinge
pin 72 to an associated front pivot arm 50 adjacent its proximal end 50b.  Similarly, at proximal end 52b each rear pivot arm 52 is pierced, while the tail portion 46 of mounting plate 42 is provided with a plurality of rearwardly projecting angle
brackets 74, each of which is also pierced and is rotatably coupled in a conventional fashion via a hinge pin 76 to an associated rear pivot arm 52 adjacent its proximal end 52b.  However, the trailing portion of each rear pivot arm 52 preferably forms
an elbow 53a resulting in an angled tail segment 53b which, as shown best in FIGS. 3, 8 and 11, and particularly in FIG. 11A, encompasses proximal end 52b; pivot arm 52 tapers, i.e., narrows in height, along tail segment 53b towards proximal end 52b.
 When the air deflection elements 36 are in the fully retracted position, the trailing edge 40 of each air deflection element 36 is located adjacent to, and abuts, the associated trailing edge of the vehicle; thus, as shown best in FIG. 3 for
upper air deflection element 36a, the trailing edge 40 is adjacent to and abuts upper trailing corner edge 28 of trailer 16.  However, as shown best in FIG. 4 for upper air deflection element 36a, in order to accommodate the rear pivot arms 52 when the
air deflection elements 36 are in their fully retracted positions, each air deflection element 36 is illustratively provided along its trailing edge 40 with a plurality of pairs of slits 75 in the vicinity of the rear pivot arms 52, the pair of slits 75
shown in FIG. 4 defining therebetween an elevated portion 77 along the trailing edge 40 of air deflection element 36 that will overlie the trailing portions of the central pair of rear pivot arms 52 when the air deflection element 36 is in the fully
retracted position, each elevated portion 77 having a trailing edge 40a which is parallel to, but which is displaced outwardly a small distance from, the trailing edge 40, as shown in FIGS. 3, 8 and 11.  It is to be understood, however, that in the case
of a larger, long-haul vehicle with more than two rear pivot arms 52, each air deflection element 36 will be provided with a similar pair of slits in the vicinity of each outer rear pivot arm, on either side thereof, that each such other pair of such
slits will define therebetween a similar but narrower elevated portion along the trailing edge of each air deflection element, and that such elevated portion will similarly overlie each such outer rear pivot arm.
 Air deflection apparatus 10 further comprises drive components with which the air deflection elements may be deployed and retracted, and caused to assume differing positions of deployment; the drive components may be operated either manually or
with powered assistance, and in the latter case, the drive components may even be remotely controlled, e.g., by the driver from the cab 14 of the vehicle, as will be described in further detail hereinafter, and the drive components can be hydraulically,
pneumatically or electro-mechanically driven.  The most preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in FIGS. 1-11A as including electro-mechanical drive components that are remotely controlled, although it should be understood that alternative
implementations utilizing drive components that are hydraulically or pneumatically driven are well within the skill of the art.
 As shown best in FIG. 4, the illustrative electro-mechanical drive components are preferably situated on the base portion 44 of each mounting plate 42, and as mentioned hereinbefore, are preferably positioned substantially along the imaginary
center line of each air deflection element 36, oriented along the direction of travel of the vehicle, and situated in between the driven pair of front pivot arms 50.  As shown best in FIGS. 3 and 5-10, the illustrative electro-mechanical drive components
preferably comprise, for each air deflection element 36, a reversible drive motor 78 adapted to impart rotational motion to a threaded spindle 80, which extends from the drive shaft (not shown) of drive motor 78, and which, at its other end distal from
drive motor 78, is journaled for rotation in an angle bracket 82.  The drive components also comprise a drive block 84, adapted for movement along spindle 80 via an internally threaded bore 86 adapted to accept and to allow rotation of spindle 80, with
the drive block 84 also carrying a pair of drive pegs 88, oriented orthogonally to bore 84, and which may be formed integrally with drive block 84.
 The drive components further comprise a pair of elongated cam links 90, each having a distal end 90a and a proximal end 90b, and in each of which a first aperture 92 is formed adjacent the proximal end 90b thereof, the first aperture 92 being
adapted to receive, and to allow the cam link 90 to rotate about, one of the drive pegs 88 of drive block 84; a second aperture 94 is formed adjacent the distal end 90a of each cam link 90, the second aperture 94 being adapted to receive and to bear on a
drive post 96 (shown best in FIG. 7).  Drive post 96 extends along its longitudinal axis through the apertures 94 and towards the driven pair of front pivot arms 50, with the ends of post 96 adapted to engage elongated slots 98 located in each one of the
pair of driven front pivot arms 50, in the vicinity of their respective proximal ends 50b.
 FIG. 5 depicts the configuration of the aforementioned drive components when the associated air deflection element is in the fully retracted position, which position is illustrated, for upper air deflection element 36a, in FIG. 3.  When drive
motor 78 is energized by a control unit (not shown in the drawings), the spindle 80 rotates, which causes drive block 84 to begin moving towards the rear of the vehicle (to the right as shown in the drawings), sliding along base portion 44 of mounting
plate 42.  As shown best by comparing the positions of the drive components as depicted in FIG. 5 with their positions as depicted in solid lines in FIG. 9, this motion causes pegs 88 to exert a force on cam links 90, such that the latter begin to rotate
about the former (in a counterclockwise fashion, from the perspective shown in the drawings), thus constraining the distal end 90a of each cam link 90 to describe an arc (initially moving away from the vehicle body), and through the action of drive post
96, compelling the associated driven front pivot arm 50 in turn to move in the direction shown by the arrow B in FIG. 9.  This motion of the driven front pivot arms 50 causes the associated air deflection element 36 to begin to move away from the vehicle
body and towards the rear of the vehicle, illustratively to a first deployed position as depicted in solid lines in FIG. 8 for upper air deflection element 36a.
 As drive motor 78 is caused to continue to impart rotational motion to spindle 80, drive block 84 is caused to move further towards the rear of the vehicle, illustratively to the position shown in phantom lines in FIG. 9, constraining the other
electro-mechanical drive components to continue to move as well, each in the manner described above, except that the continued movement of the distal ends 90a of cam links 90 in the same arc-like fashion begins to draw those distal ends back towards the
vehicle body, compelling drive post 96 to slide from one end of slot 98 towards the other, and thereby causing the associated driven front pivot arms 50 to continue to move in the direction indicated by arrow B in FIG. 9.  This motion, in turn, causes
the associated air deflection element 36 to move further towards the rear of the vehicle, illustratively to a second deployed position, as depicted in phantom lines in FIG. 8 for upper air deflection element 36a, and illustratively beyond to yet a third
deployed position, as depicted in phantom lines in FIGS. 11 and 11A for upper air deflection element 36a.
 As the movements described above are caused to continue even further, the electro-mechanical drive components ultimately reach the positions shown in FIG. 10, constraining the associated driven pair of front pivot arms 50 to move in the
direction indicated by arrow C in FIG. 10 and ultimately to positions that abut the vehicle body.  FIG. 10 depicts the configuration of the aforementioned drive components when the associated air deflection element is in the fully extended deployed
position, which position is illustrated, for upper air deflection element 36a, in solid lines in FIGS. 11 and 11A.  In this fully extended deployed position, the forward edge 38a of air deflection element 36 is located adjacent to, and abuts, the
associated trailing edge of the vehicle; as shown best in FIG. 11A for upper air deflection element 36a, the forward edge 38a of which is adjacent to and abuts upper trailing corner edge 28 of trailer 16, with front pivot arms 50 facilitating this
position by virtue of the substantially right angle 55 formed between each projection 54 and its associated front pivot arm 50 (mentioned hereinbefore in connection with FIGS. 3A and 3B), which allows each front pivot arm 50 to extend over and to ""nest""
against the upper trailing corner edge 28 of trailer 16.
 As will be evident to those skilled in the art, the movements of the drive components as described above will be reversed when the motor is energized with the opposite rotation, thus ultimately causing the associated air deflection element 36 to
begin to move towards the front of the vehicle and towards the vehicle body, i.e., causing retraction of the air deflection element 36 from the fully extended deployed position, illustrated for upper air deflection element 36a in solid lines in FIGS. 11
and 11A, through the three deployed positions illustrated for upper air deflection element 36a in phantom lines in FIG. 11 and in both phantom and solid lines in FIG. 8, eventually to the fully retracted position, illustrated for upper air deflection
element 36a in FIG. 3.
 While only five discrete positions, i.e., a fully retracted position, three deployed positions, and a fully extended deployed position, have been described thus far (and are depicted in the drawings) for each air deflection element 36, it is to
be understood that in the most preferred embodiment, in which the drive components are controlled remotely and are either hydraulically, pneumatically or electro-mechanically driven, it will be possible to deploy the air deflection elements 36 in a
multiplicity of positions, along a continuum ranging from the fully retracted position to the fully extended deployed position, and that the degree of deployment at any given time can be chosen as may be deemed advisable by the driver, depending on
whether the vehicle is moving, and if so, on the speed at which it is moving, as well as other factors such as ambient wind speed and direction and other weather conditions, in order to optimize the aerodynamic drag reduction that those air deflection
elements can provide.
 It will be evident from the foregoing description and from the drawings of this most preferred embodiment of the invention that when the vehicle is moving at low speeds, then it is possible, by deploying the air deflection elements 36 only part
way (e.g., as shown in solid lines in FIG. 8), to cause most of the airflow originating along the top and sides of the vehicle to be diverted into the area behind the vehicle, by being ""ducted"" or ""scooped"" between the air deflection elements 36 and the
vehicle body, thus utilizing primarily the inner surface of each air deflection element.  On the other hand, when the vehicle is moving at high speeds, then it is possible, by deploying the air deflection elements 36 to their fully extended deployed
positions (as shown in solid lines in FIG. 11), to cause most of the airflow originating along the top and sides of the vehicle to be diverted into the area behind the vehicle, by being ""bent"" over and around the air deflection elements 36, thus
utilizing primarily the outer surface of each air deflection element.  However, when the vehicle is moving at moderate speeds, then it is possible, by deploying the air deflection elements 36 to intermediate positions (e.g., as shown in phantom lines in
FIG. 8, or as shown in phantom lines in FIG. 11), to cause the airflow originating along the top and sides of the vehicle to be diverted into the area behind the vehicle in both ways, thus utilizing both the inner and outer surfaces of each air
deflection element 36 simultaneously, with the contribution of each component of the diversion varying, depending upon the extent of deployment.  Nevertheless, in all cases, the drag associated with the area of low pressure which develops behind the
vehicle is reduced, while at the same time, the drag associated with the breakdown of the laminar air flow along the top and sides of the vehicle is also reduced, and the latter component of the drag is reduced whether the air deflection elements 36 are
deployed or remain fully retracted (as shown in FIG. 3).
 As mentioned hereinbefore, all of the air deflection elements that comprise air deflection apparatus 10 are preferably displaceable in unison.  Thus, in cases in which the apparatus comprises three air deflection elements (as illustrated in the
drawings), there will be three reversible drive motors, all of which preferably may be energized simultaneously by a single control unit (not shown), and as will be evident to those skilled in the art, appropriate gears may be built into the drive motors
themselves, or appropriate circuitry may be built into the control unit, so as to facilitate actuation of the drive motors for rotation in either direction, i.e., either clockwise or counterclockwise.
 The control unit may be connected to any convenient energy source, e.g., the energy may be ""tapped"" from the existing wiring for the vehicle's electrically-energized marker lights 35.  The control unit circuitry also preferably includes an
actuator switch (not shown), such as a manual toggle switch which well known in the art and is available commercially from many sources, that is connected to control unit either with hard wiring or wirelessly, and that enables the drive motors to be
energized and/or de-energized, for rotation in one direction or the other; such a switch could be situated conveniently on the outside of the vehicle body, at or near the rear of the vehicle, allowing direct visual observation by the vehicle driver (or
other user of the apparatus) of the extent to which the air deflection elements have been deployed or retracted as a result of operation of the actuator switch, but more preferably the actuator switch (or even more preferably, a second, identical
actuator switch) may be located in the cab of the vehicle for remote actuation of the drive motors by the driver of the vehicle, e.g., in inclement weather, even without direct visual confirmation of the resulting deployment or retraction of the air
deflection elements.  However, optionally, and still more preferably, sensors are used, as will be described in further detail hereinafter, to provide a remote indication in the cab of the vehicle, of the current positions of each of the air deflection
elements, so as to facilitate remote deployment and retraction thereof.
 Preferably, the control unit circuitry also includes at least two stop/safety limit switches (not shown in the drawings) adapted to de-energize the drive motors automatically once the fully extended deployed position and/or the fully retracted
position is reached, thereby preventing possible damage due to ""over-deployment"" and/or ""over-retraction"" of each air deflection element.  Such limit switches are available commercially, in a variety of sizes and body styles, with a broad selection of
operator types, actuator arms, circuit arrangements and connection options, from a number of manufacturers, such as Rockwell Automation, Inc.  of Milwaukee, Wis., U.S.A., which markets a series of such switches under the Allen-Bradley trademark, using
the model or grade designation 440P.  Although not shown in the drawings, one such limit switch is preferably positioned or mounted on the underside 56 of each air deflection element 36, adjacent the forward edge 38a, and another limit switch is
preferably situated on mounting plate 42, disposed over upper trailing corner edge 28 of the vehicle body.
 As will be apparent from the drawings, if the air deflection elements 36 are fabricated of an opaque material, then when they are deployed they will sometimes cover or obscure marker lights 35, especially when they are in their fully extended
deployed positions, shown illustratively for upper air deflection element 36a in solid lines in FIG. 11.  Since travel with such marker lights obscured is prohibited in most jurisdictions for safety reasons, the preferred embodiment of the invention
includes, for each air deflection element 36, a plurality of light sources such as light-emitting diodes (or ""LEDs"") 102, which are positioned adjacent the trailing edge 40 of each air deflection element 36, in an array which preferably reproduces both
the number and positions of the vehicle's native marker lights 35, and which may be illuminated, either automatically or manually by the driver of the vehicle, in the same manner in which the vehicle's native marker lights 35 are normally illuminated,
thus enabling the air deflection elements 36 to be used under all driving conditions, including those which would ordinarily mandate the use of the vehicle's native marker lights 35 (such as after sundown or before sunrise, or in inclement weather), the
LEDs 102 providing at least the same safety illumination for the rear of the vehicle when the air deflection elements 36 are maximally deployed as do the vehicle's native marker lights 35 when the air deflection elements 36 are retracted (or are absent).
 Although this feature is illustrated in the drawings most clearly with respect to the LEDs 102 positioned on upper air deflection element 36a, duplicating the marker lights 35 aligned transversely across the upper portion of rear-facing surface
22 of trailer 16, it is to be understood that additional LEDs may be positioned on the trailing edges of both right side air deflection element 36b and left side air deflection element 36c, whether or not those LEDs are intended to duplicate any of the
vehicle's native marker lights or other native taillights (e.g., brake lights, back-up lights, directional signal lights, etc.) that may be positioned (perhaps aligned vertically) along the side portions of rear-facing surface 22 of trailer 16, between
the left rear cargo door 24 and the left side trailing corner edge 30 of trailer 16, and/or between the right rear cargo door 26 and the right side trailing corner edge 32 of trailer 16.
 As mentioned hereinbefore, and turning next to FIGS. 12-22 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-11A, the preferred embodiment of the invention may, in the alternative, comprise drive components with which the air deflection elements 36 may
be deployed and retracted (and caused to assume differing positions of deployment) through manual manipulation, using a tool that is specially designed for that purpose.
 As shown best in FIGS. 12 and 16, the illustrative drive components for manual deployment are preferably situated on the base portion 44 of each mounting plate 42, and are preferably positioned substantially along the imaginary center line of
each air deflection element 36, oriented along the direction of travel of the vehicle, situated in between, and linked to, the driven pair of front pivot arms 50, in a manner similar to the electro-mechanical drive components described hereinbefore.  As
best shown in FIGS. 15-21, the alternate drive components for manual deployment illustratively comprise, for each air deflection element 36, a pulley system 110 including a pulley cable 112, having a trailing end 114 and a leading end 116, and enclosing
a release cable 118, having a trailing end 120 and a leading end 122.  Release cable 118 is slidably disposed coaxially within pulley cable 112, with sufficient clearance therebetween to allow each cable to be moved longitudinally, independently of one
another.  Release cable 118 may be fabricated of a flexible metal wire or chain, or sturdy rope or twine, or of another natural or synthetic material, as is well known in the art.
 Between its trailing end 114 and its leading end 116, pulley cable 112 passes through a plurality of intermediate directional guides 124, and at its trailing end 114, pulley cable 112 terminates at an end guide 126, having an aperture 128 and
mounted on an angle bracket 130 having an aperture 132 that is coaxially aligned with aperture 128, so as to allow release cable 118 to pass therethrough and to emerge from pulley cable 112, extending beyond the trailing end 114 thereof.  As shown best
in FIG. 14, the angle bracket 130 is affixed to the under surface 56 of the associated air deflection element 36, slightly forward of the trailing edge 40a of the raised elevated portion 77 overlying the central pair of rear pivot arms 52, with end guide
126 preferably positioned substantially along the imaginary center line of that air deflection element, such that release cable 118 is accessible and manipulable from the rear of the vehicle, as will be described hereinafter; for this purpose, release
cable 118 terminates at its trailing end 120 in an O-ring 134.
 At its leading end 116, pulley cable 112 is tethered to an air deflection element position adjustment assembly, generally designated 136.  The air deflection element position adjustment assembly 136 illustratively includes a slide unit,
generally designated 138 and comprising a carriage 140 which is slidable along a slide bar 142, the carriage 140 including a base member 144 that carries a pair of bracket members 146, a cam 148 that is pivotally attached to the bracket members 146 via a
hinge pin 150, and that has a split nose portion 149.  The air deflection element position adjustment assembly 136 also includes a spring-loaded lock-pin mechanism, generally designated 152, which is adapted to reciprocate between a locked position,
depicted most clearly in FIGS. 17 and 18, and a released or unlocked position, depicted most clearly in FIGS. 19 and 20, in a manner to be described in further detail hereinafter.
 Carriage 140 also includes a shaft member 154 oriented orthogonally to the base member 144.  At its leading end 116, pulley cable 112 terminates at an end guide 156, having an aperture 158 and mounted on shaft member 154, which has an aperture
160 that is coaxially aligned with aperture 158, so as to allow release cable 118 to pass therethrough and to emerge from pulley cable 112, extending beyond the leading end 116 thereof.  Release cable 118, at its leading end 122, terminates at pivot cam
148, to which release cable 118 is attached, illustratively via an eyelet 162, situated in a recess 163, and a hinge pin 163a that is journaled for rotation in eyelet 162.
 To facilitate engagement with slide bar 142, slide unit 138 illustratively further comprises extensions 164 depending from carriage 140, which terminate in a pair of feet 166 adapted to slidably engage within respective longitudinal recesses 168
which run along the sides of slide bar 142 for substantially its entire length, as shown best in FIGS. 17-20.  Slide bar 142 illustratively further includes a plurality of illustratively circular locking apertures 170, all substantially of the same
diameter, provided at regular intervals along the surface of slide bar 142 for substantially its entire length, and positioned substantially along its center line in an aligned fashion, as shown best in FIG. 16.  The number of apertures 170 can be chosen
to correspond to the number of discrete positions that are desired for manual deployment of the associated air deflection element 36; preferably, as shown in FIG. 16, there are between ten and twenty such apertures 170, although it is to be understood
that preferably at least five such apertures should be provided, corresponding substantially to the fully retracted position, the three deployed positions, and the fully extended deployed position for air deflection elements 36 that have been described
hereinbefore (and are depicted in the drawings).
 As best shown in FIGS. 17-20, the lock-pin mechanism 152 comprises a cross-bar 172 spanning the gap between the sides of the split nose portion 149 of pivot cam 148, and a cap 174 suspended from cross-bar 172, the cap enclosing and being adapted
to receive, in threaded engagement, one end of an illustratively cylindrical locking pin 176.  The lock-pin mechanism 152 also comprises a spring 178 coiled around a portion of locking pin 176, and disposed between an anchor member 180, that may be
formed integrally with cap 174 and through which locking pin 176 slidably extends, as well as a collar member 182 adapted for abutment with slide bar 142, with locking pin 176 extending through collar member 182 and beyond to form a tip 184, the diameter
of which is chosen to be slightly greater than that of locking pin 176, but slightly less than the diameter of apertures 170 so that tip 184 can be received in any one of apertures 170.  The bias of spring 178 urges locking pin 176 towards slide bar 142,
such that tip 184 is urged into locking engagement with one of the apertures 170, as shown best in FIG. 18.
 The special tool, that is designed for use with the manual drive components just described, comprises an adjusting pole 186, shown in FIGS. 12-14, which enables substantially simultaneous manipulation not only of the release cable 118, but also
the associated air deflection element 36; for this purpose, an illustrative tail-like extension or tongue 188 is provided, which depends from the trailing edge 40a of the raised elevated portion 77 overlying the central pair of rear pivot arms 52 of each
air deflection element 36, with an aperture 190 in tongue 188 that is preferably positioned substantially along the imaginary center line of the air deflection element 36.  As shown best in FIGS. 13-14, adjusting pole 186 comprises an elongated outer
tube 192, which is illustratively cylindrical in shape, having a proximal end 194 and a distal end 196, and a cylindrical cavity or shaft 198 disposed longitudinally within outer tube 192 and substantially coaxially therewith.  Shaft 198 has a closed
proximal end 200 situated intermediate of the proximal and distal ends 194, 196 of outer tube 192, and shaft 198 has an open distal end 202 situated near the distal end 196 of outer tube 192.
 Shaft 198 is adapted to receive an elongated inner rod 204, which is sized so that it may be disposed within shaft 198 with sufficient clearance to allow it to slide longitudinally within outer tube 192.  Inner rod 204 has a proximal end 206, at
which an enlarged stop element 207 is disposed, and a distal end 208 at which a conventional curved hook element 210 is disposed so as to protrude from the open distal end 202 of shaft 198.  A similar hook element 212, which is also curved but which is
slightly more squared off than hook element 210, is disposed at the distal end 196 of outer tube 192, on an extension 214, and carries a knob 216.  Curved hook element 210 is adapted for engagement with the O-ring 134 at the trailing end 120 of release
cable 118, while knobbed hook element 212 is adapted for engagement with the aperture 190 in tongue 188 of air deflection element 36.  Extension 216 is slightly offset from the longitudinal axis of outer tube 192, as a result of which curved hook element
210 and knobbed hook element 212 are positioned in a parallel but slightly offset relation, with knobbed hook element 212 disposed slightly above curved hook element 210, this orientation and spacing enabling curved hook element 210 to engage with O-ring
134 while knobbed hook element 212 simultaneously engages with aperture 190, as shown best in FIGS. 13 and 14.
 The proximal end 206 of inner rod 204 is positioned adjacent a conventional spring return trigger assembly 218 situated at the proximal end 200 of shaft 198.  The trigger assembly 218 comprises a coiled spring 220 disposed in the well of shaft
198 and abutting the enlarged stop element 207, as well as a trigger-shaped lever 222 which is attached to and extends substantially orthogonally from inner rod 204, through a slot-like aperture 224 in outer tube 192 along which lever 222 can be moved
longitudinally, thus moving inner rod 204 longitudinally within outer tube 192 as well; to facilitate such movement, lever 222 is shaped for engagement by a finger 226 on the hand 228 of a user.  The bias of spring 220 urges the inner rod 204, and
therefore the lever 222 and the curved hook element 210 as well, towards the respective positions in which they are shown in solid lines in FIG. 13.
 The use of adjusting pole 186 to actuate the manual drive components for deployment of the air deflection elements 36 is illustrated, primarily for upper air deflection element 36a, in FIGS. 12-14, and 17-22.  The user first lifts the adjusting
pole, as shown in FIG. 12, and manipulates it such that curved hook element 210 engages with O-ring 134 while knobbed hook element 212 simultaneously engages with aperture 190 in tongue extension 188, as shown best in FIGS. 13 and 14.  The user then
unlocks the air deflection element position adjustment assembly 136 by squeezing or otherwise moving the lever 222 in the direction of arrow D in FIG. 13, to the position shown therein in phantom lines, which causes curved hook element 210 to move in the
direction of arrow E in FIG. 13, thus in turn causing displacement of O-ring 134 (also illustrated in phantom lines in FIG. 13) and imparting longitudinal movement to the trailing end 120 of release cable 118.
 The displacement of release cable 118 at its trailing end 120 is transmitted to its leading end 122 as release cable 118 moves within pulley cable 112; this displacement is then transmitted to pivot cam 148, causing the latter to move from the
position shown in FIG. 18 to the position shown in FIG. 20, and thus releasing lock-pin mechanism 152 by causing locking pin 176 to move from the position shown in FIG. 19 to the position shown in FIG. 20, and moving tip 184 out of engagement with
aperture 170 in slide bar 142, as shown best in FIG. 20, to permit movement of slide unit 138 along slide bar 142.
 Once lock-pin mechanism 152 has thus been released, the user may thereafter utilize adjusting pole 186 to affect the position of the air deflection element.  Starting from the fully retracted position, as illustrated for upper air deflection
element 36a in FIG. 12, appropriate manipulation of the adjusting pole by the user (downward and rearward as illustrated in FIG. 12 for upper air deflection element 36a), while maintaining pressure on lever 222 against the bias of spring 220 so as to
keep lever 222 in the position shown in phantom lines in FIG. 13, and also while knobbed hook element 212 is still engaged with the aperture 190 in tongue extension 188 as shown in FIG. 13, will not only impart deploying movement to upper air deflection
element 36a itself, but will also impart longitudinal motion to the trailing end 114 of pulley cable 112, through the linkage of bracket 130 and end guide 126.  This longitudinal movement of pulley cable 112 at its trailing end 114 is then transmitted to
its leading end 116 through the intermediate guides 124, and is thereafter transmitted, through the force that pulley cable 112 exerts on end guide 158 and shaft member 154, to slide unit 138, whereupon it is translated into travel of carriage 140, along
slide bar 142, towards the rear of the vehicle, in the direction indicated by arrow F in FIG. 19, when the air deflection element 36 is being deployed.
 As a result of the force exerted by the user on the trailing edge of the air deflection element through the adjusting pole 186, the air deflection element may be caused to move away from the vehicle body and towards the rear of the vehicle, and
then to range through a number of deployed positions (an illustrative pair of which are shown for upper air deflection element 36a in FIG. 21, one in solid lines and one in phantom lines, and an illustrative one of which is shown for upper air deflection
element 36a in phantom lines in FIG. 22), to a fully extended deployed position (as shown for upper air deflection element 36a in solid lines in FIG. 22), with the front pivot arms 50 and rear pivot arms 52 moving in a manner which is virtually identical
to that which occurs with the electro-mechanical drive components described hereinbefore.
 When the desired degree of deployment is reached, the user releases lever 222 which, through the linkage of release cable 118 and the bias of springs 178 and 220, causes pivot cam 148 to move from the position shown in FIG. 20 back to the
position shown in FIG. 18, and thus secures lock-pin mechanism 152 by causing locking pin 176 to move from the position shown in FIG. 20 back to the position shown in FIG. 19, allowing the tip 184 of locking pin 176 to engage with a different one of the
apertures 170 in slide bar 142, thus returning the air deflection element position adjustment assembly 136 to a locked position.  Thereafter, the user may disengage the adjusting pole 186 from O-ring 134 and aperture 190.
 The use of adjusting pole 186 to actuate the manual drive components for retraction of the air deflection elements 36 is also illustrated, primarily in FIGS. 14 and 17-22, and as will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, is similar
to the deployment of those components using that implement, except that it involves movement of the air deflection element in the reverse direction.  The user first re-engages the adjusting pole 186 with O-ring 134 and aperture 190, as described
hereinbefore, but now with knob 216 on knobbed hook element 212 engaging with the inner surface of tongue 188, as shown best in FIG. 14, so as to prevent knobbed hook element from sliding out of engagement with aperture 190.  The user then unlocks the
air deflection element position adjustment assembly 136, as described hereinbefore, as shown by the arrows E in FIG. 14, and thereafter, appropriate manipulation of the adjusting pole by the user (upward and forward for upper air deflection element 36a,
as indicated by arrow G in FIG. 14), while maintaining pressure on lever 222, causes the air deflection element 36 to move towards the front of the vehicle and inwards towards the vehicle body.
 However, when the air deflection element 36 is being retracted, in order simultaneously to cause carriage 140 to travel along slide bar 142 towards the front of the vehicle, in the direction opposite that indicated by arrow F in FIG. 19, the
manual drive components preferably further comprise an additional mechanical linkage, illustratively a connector strut 230 which is shown in FIGS. 15-22, strut 230 having a distal end 230a and a proximal end 230b, and a first aperture 232 formed adjacent
the distal end 230a thereof, the first aperture 232 being adapted to receive a conventional hinge pin 234 that rotatably couples strut 230 at its distal end 230a to one of the driven pair of front pivot arms 50 (as shown best in FIG. 21); a second
aperture 236 is formed adjacent the proximal end 230b of strut 230, the second aperture 236 being adapted to receive a conventional hinge pin 238 that rotatably couples strut 230 to carriage 140 (as shown best in FIGS. 16-20).  Although only a single
connector strut 230 is shown in the drawings, it is to be understood that a symmetrically situated pair of such connector struts, each with its own set of apertures and associated hinge pins, could be used.
 As shown best by comparing the position of strut 230 as depicted in FIG. 15 with its several positions as depicted in solid lines and in phantom lines in FIG. 21, and in solid lines in FIG. 22, the travel of carriage 140 along slide bar 142
during the deployment of air deflection element 36, in the direction indicated by arrow F in FIG. 17, exerts a force on strut 230, such that the latter begins to rotate about hinge pin 238 (in a counterclockwise fashion, from the perspective shown in the
drawings), thus constraining the distal end 230a to describe an arc (initially moving away from the vehicle body, and as the deployment continues, back towards the vehicle body again).  However, during retraction of the air deflection element 36, the
movement of front pivot arm 50 causes strut 230 to rotate about hinge pin 238 such that distal end 230a describes same arc as during deployment, but in the opposite direction (in a clockwise fashion, from the perspective of the drawings), and such that
strut 230 exerts a force on carriage 140 which in turn compels the latter to travel along slide bar 142 in the direction opposite that indicated by arrow F in FIG. 17, returning the manual drive components eventually to the positions shown in FIG. 17
when the air deflection element 36 returns to the fully retracted position (illustrated for upper air deflection element 36a in FIG. 15).
 When the fully retracted position is reached, the user releases lever 222 which, through the bias of spring 220, causes the curved hook element 210 to move in the direction indicated by arrow H (as shown in phantom lines) in FIG. 14 and to
disengage from O-ring 134, and through the linkage of release cable 118 the bias of spring 178, causes pivot cam 148 to move from the position shown in FIG. 20 back to the position shown in FIG. 18, and thus secures lock-pin mechanism 152 by causing
locking pin 176 to move from the position shown in FIG. 20 back to the position shown in FIG. 19, allowing the tip 184 of locking pin 176 to engage with the aperture 170 in slide bar 142 that is closest to the front of the vehicle, thus returning the air
deflection element position adjustment assembly 136 to a locked position.  Thereafter, the user may disengage the adjusting pole 186 from aperture 190 and withdraw the adjusting pole 186, as indicated by arrow I (as shown in phantom lines in FIG. 14).
 Although the manual drive components and the adjusting pole for use therewith have been described and illustrated in the drawings primarily with respect to upper air deflection element 36a, it is to be understood that the same manual drive
components may be provided for right side air deflection element 36b and for left side air deflection element 36c, and that the same adjusting pole (or perhaps one that is somewhat shorter than that illustrated in FIG. 12) may be used, in conjunction
with those manual drive components, for manipulation of right side air deflection element 36b and left side air deflection element 36c.
 Turning now to FIGS. 23-25 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-22, an alternate structure comprising a different shape and attachment structure for one or more of the rear pivot arms 52 which link each air deflection element 36 to the
vehicle body, and which support and help to deploy and retract each air deflection element 36, is shown illustratively in connection with upper air deflection element 36a (and illustratively also with electro-mechanical drive components, substantially as
shown in FIG. 3).  More specifically, an alternate rear pivot arm 52' may be provided which, as may be seen by comparing FIGS. 23 and 24 with FIGS. 3 and 4, comprises a shaft that is not as tall, i.e., is more flat (when viewed from the side, as in FIG.
23), but is wider (when viewed from above, as in FIG. 24), than the rear pivot arm 52 described hereinbefore.  Moreover, as shown in FIGS. 23 and 25, the alternate rear pivot arm 52' forms an elbow 53a' which is disposed at substantially at a right
angle, resulting in a tail section 53b' which encompasses the proximal end 52b' of alternate rear pivot arm 52', and which substantially overlies tail portion 48 of mounting plate 42.
 In addition, as shown best in FIGS. 24 and 25, the trailing portion of the alternate rear pivot arm 52' is even wider than elsewhere along its length, having a flared shape, indicated by the numeral 52c in FIG. 24, that widens towards the rear
of the vehicle (towards the right in FIG. 24) until elbow 53a' is reached.  In order to accommodate this flared shape 52c when the air deflection elements 36 are in their fully retracted positions, each air deflection element 36 is provided along its
trailing edge 40 with an elevated portion 77' that is correspondingly flared in shape, and that will overlie the associated rear pivot arm 52' when the air deflection element 36 is in the fully retracted position, as shown best in FIG. 25.  Furthermore,
and also as shown best in FIG. 25, although the alternate rear pivot arm 52' may be secured to the mounting plate 42 (and thereby to the vehicle body) in substantially the same manner as rear pivot arm 52, it will be understood that in order to
accommodate the width of alternate rear pivot arm 52' at its proximal end 52b', a hinge pin 76' must be provided that will necessarily be longer than the hinge pin 76 used for rear pivot arm 52.  It will also be understood that, for added stability the
proximal end 52b' of alternate rear pivot arm 52' can be curled upon itself to form an opening within which hinge pin 76' may be journaled for rotation, as shown best in FIG. 23.
 All of the foregoing differences serve to provide greater lateral support and resistance to cross wind stresses, thereby providing greater rigidity and helping to avoid shifting and wobbling of, the associated air deflection element, especially
when the latter is deployed.  It should also be understood that, in view of the foregoing differences and the increase in stability that results therefrom, it may be possible to substitute a single alternate rear pivot arm 52' for the central pair of
rear pivot arms 52 described hereinbefore in connection with FIGS. 1-22.  However, the design of alternate rear pivot arm 52', as shown in FIGS. 23-25, yields a larger cross-section in the direction of the airflow, leading to higher wind resistance and
turbulence.
 On the other hand, the rear pivot arm 52 described hereinbefore has a smaller cross-section in the direction of the airflow than the alternate rear pivot arm 52', and therefore the former presents less aerodynamic drag, although conversely it
also provides less lateral support and less resistance to cross-wind stresses.  While the drawings depict these two different designs for the rear pivot arms as being mutually exclusive, it should be understood that it may be possible to combine both
designs into a hybrid rear pivot arm (not shown in the drawings), in which the proximal end could be wide and flat, as shown in FIGS. 23 and 24, while the distal end is tall but narrow, as shown, for example, in FIGS. 3 and 4, with a ""transition""
occurring, from one design to the other, at some intermediate point along the length of the pivot arm.
 Turning now to FIGS. 26-28 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-25, an alternate, somewhat different (but still representative) vehicular environment is depicted, in which the retractable air deflection apparatus of the present invention
might be used.  This illustrative vehicular environment for the invention comprises a typical medium-sized 2-axle box truck 312 having a passenger compartment 314 and a cargo compartment 316.  As with trailer 16, cargo compartment 316 is shaped
fundamentally as a rectangular parallelopiped, having an upper surface 318, a left side surface 320, a right side surface (not shown in the drawings), a front-facing surface (also not shown in the drawings), a rear-facing surface 322 having an opening
that is closed by a roll-up rear cargo door 324 for access to the interior of cargo compartment 316, an upper trailing corner edge 328, a left side trailing corner edge 330, a right side trailing corner edge 332, a lower trailing corner edge 334, and a
plurality of electrically-energized marker lights 335 located at various positions on rear-facing surface 322, several of which are customarily aligned transversely across the upper portion of rear-facing surface 322, substantially parallel to and just
below the upper trailing corner edge 328 of cargo compartment 316, and above the cargo door 324, and several of which are positioned (and customarily aligned vertically) along the side portions of rear-facing surface 322, between the cargo door 324 and
the left side trailing corner edge 330 of cargo compartment 316, and/or between the cargo door 324 and the right side trailing corner edge 332 of cargo compartment 316.
 As described hereinbefore in connection with tractor-trailer 12, the air deflection apparatus 310 for use with box truck 312 most preferably comprises at least one, and preferably at least three air deflection elements 336, each of which is
preferably fabricated of aircraft grade aluminum; one air deflection element 336a is installed transversely across the upper surface 318 of cargo compartment 316, adjacent and substantially parallel to the upper trailing corner edge 328 and preferably
extending horizontally across the entire width of cargo compartment 316, substantially from corner to corner, and two air deflection elements 336b and 336c are installed vertically, on the left side surface 320 of cargo compartment 316, adjacent and
substantially parallel to the left side trailing corner edge 330, and on the right side surface, adjacent and substantially parallel to the opposite, right side trailing corner edge 332, respectively, with these two air deflection elements extending
vertically and preferably spanning the overall height of the vehicle, also substantially from corner to corner.
 Therefore, for a typical medium-haul vehicle such as the box truck 312 depicted in FIGS. 26 and 27, having a cargo compartment 316 that ranges from about eight feet wide to about eight feet, six inches wide, and ranges from about seven feet high
to about nine feet high, upper air deflection element 336a will preferably have a transverse or lengthwise dimension ranging from about eight feet to about eight feet, six inches, while side air deflection elements 336b and 336c will both preferably have
a lengthwise dimension (vertical, in these cases) ranging from about seven feet to about nine feet.  Each air deflection element 336 comprises a leading edge 338 and a trailing edge 340, but in this illustrative vehicular environment, each air deflection
element is dimensioned to extend widthwise, from its leading edge to its trailing edge, for a distance of twelve to fifteen inches, which is approximately three percent of the overall length of twenty-eight to thirty-four feet that is typical for a
medium-haul cargo vehicle such as box truck 312.
 The air deflection apparatus 310 illustrated in FIG. 26 exemplifies an alternative, but still preferred, embodiment of the present invention, as will be described in further detail hereinafter.  However, FIG. 26 also serves to illustrate that
any of the preferred embodiments of the retractable air deflection apparatus of the present invention, including the most preferred embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1-25, may be used with, and will function to reduce aerodynamic drag for, squared-off or
box-shaped vehicles of various lengths and heights, regardless of whether they are equipped with a pair of hinged, swinging rear cargo doors, or with a single roll-up rear cargo door, or even with no rear doors at all, as is the case with most buses and
railroad cars.
 FIG. 27 is a view from the rear of the air deflection apparatus 310 in the same exemplary vehicular environment as shown in FIG. 26, but with all of the air deflection elements 336 shown as having been moved, as indicated by the arrows J, into
their fully extended deployed positions, while FIG. 28 is a view from above of the upper air deflection element 336a in its fully retracted position.  However, FIGS. 27 and 28 also serve to illustrate that, in order to insure that the air deflection
elements merely abut, but do not interfere with or strike, one another at their adjacent corners, when all of the air deflection elements are in their fully extended deployed positions, the ends 337 of the air deflection elements may be beveled or
otherwise contoured, as shown best in FIG. 28, so as to enable the air deflection elements to dovetail with one another, as shown in FIG. 27.
 Thus, when three air deflection elements are used, the beveling is applied to the apical ends of left side air deflection element 336b and of right side air deflection element 336c, and preferably to the left and right ends of upper air
deflection element 336a as well, as shown in FIGS. 27 and 28, although less preferably, the beveling can be applied only to the apical ends of the left and right side air deflection elements 336b, 336c, and not at all to the upper air deflection element
336a.  While the beveling is depicted in FIG. 27 in conjunction with air deflection apparatus 310 as used on box truck 312, it is to be understood that the same beveling may be utilized for the same purpose in conjunction with air deflection apparatus 10
as used on tractor-trailer 16, and can be utilized for the same purpose in conjunction with the invention as it is used in other vehicular environments as well.
 Referring next to FIGS. 29-31 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-28, the alternative, but still preferred, embodiment of the retractable air deflection apparatus of the present invention, mentioned in passing hereinbefore, will now be
described in further detail.  In this second embodiment, the shapes of the air deflection elements 336 themselves do not differ significantly from the shapes of the air deflection elements 36 of the most preferred embodiment, such that the shapes of the
air deflection elements 336 as shown in the drawings may be symbolized by the same modified four-digit NACA numbers, 9401-01 and/or 9401-11, as were used to represent the shapes of the air deflection elements 36, as illustrated in FIGS. 3-11A (and such
that the same ten modified four-digit NACA numbers as are set forth above symbolize other exemplary airfoil shapes that will be acceptable for use with the this second embodiment of the present invention).  However, there are significant differences in
the front pivot arms 350 and the rear pivot arms 352 that link each air deflection element 336 to the vehicle body, and that support and help to deploy and retract each air deflection element 336.  In addition, in this embodiment the air deflection
elements 336 may be caused to assume only two discrete positions (a fully retracted position, shown in FIG. 29, and a deployed position, shown in FIG. 30), and there are no drive components to assist with the deployment and retraction; instead, the air
deflection elements 336 may be deployed and retracted through direct manual manipulation of the air deflection elements themselves by a user (not shown in the drawings), without the assistance of a tool.
 Thus, this second embodiment may be more suitable for use in conjunction with the medium-haul vehicular environment exemplified by box truck 312, and especially in conjunction with a short-haul vehicular environment exemplified by even smaller
and/or shorter vehicles, such as short-haul delivery trucks and panel vans, for which the top rear edge of the vehicle is easily reachable from the ground, and the body is only about six feet wide.  Nevertheless, although this embodiment will be
described, and is illustrated in the drawings, in conjunction with the medium-haul vehicular environment exemplified by box truck 312, it is to be understood that the air deflection apparatus 310 of this embodiment may also be utilized with substantially
similar advantage in conjunction with the long-haul vehicular environment exemplified by tractor-trailer 12, and that conversely, the air deflection apparatus 10 of the most preferred embodiment (described hereinbefore, and illustrated in FIGS. 1-22, in
conjunction with the long-haul vehicular environment exemplified by tractor-trailer 12) may be utilized with substantially similar advantage in conjunction with the medium-haul vehicular environment exemplified by box truck 312.
 As shown in FIGS. 29 and 30, the front pivot arms 350 and the rear pivot arms 352 are somewhat shorter than the counterpart front and rear pivot arms 50 and 52 described hereinbefore in connection with the most preferred embodiment of the
invention, and although the underside 356 of air deflection element 336 carries leading angle brackets 358 as well as trailing angle brackets 364 for attachment to the air deflection element of the respective front and the rear pivot arms 350, 352 at
their respective distal ends, the rear pivot arms 352 are coupled at their proximal ends to mounting plate 342 (which is affixed to the vehicle body illustratively via bolts or rivets 345) in a manner which differs from the way in which rear pivot arms
52 are coupled to mounting plate 42, a manner which allows rear pivot arms 352 to rotate (in a clockwise fashion, from the perspective of these drawings) from the position shown in FIG. 29 to the position shown in FIG. 30, but which does not allow rear
pivot arms 352 to rotate beyond the position shown in FIG. 30.
 Thus, each air deflection element 336 can be deployed no further than the position illustrated in FIG. 30, and cannot reach the fully extended deployed position illustrated for air deflection elements 36 in solid lines in FIGS. 11 and 22 (in
which the forward edge of each air deflection element 36 is positioned adjacent to, and abuts, the associated trailing edge of the vehicle); however, in the medium-haul and short-haul vehicular environments for which this second embodiment of the
invention may be better suited, such a fully extended deployed position is thought to be unnecessary, since the aerodynamic benefits that it can provide in long-haul vehicular environments are rarely needed in medium-haul and short-haul environments.
 Preferably, front pivot arms 350 may be shaped so as to minimize the aerodynamic drag in the direction of the airflow that they themselves interpose between the vehicle body and the associated air deflection element 336 when the latter is in the
deployed position (shown illustratively in FIG. 30 in connection with upper air deflection element 336a).  That preferable shape, which is ellipsoidal in cross-section as shown best in FIG. 31, allows air to flow around each front pivot arm 350 in the
most efficient fashion, as indicated by the arrows K in FIG. 31.
 Referring next to FIGS. 32-36, in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-31, this second embodiment of the invention may optionally comprise power-assisted drive components with which the air deflection elements of FIG. 26 may be caused to
assume different positions, so that the air deflection elements 336 need not be deployed and retracted manually.  These drive components may be remotely controlled, and may be hydraulically, pneumatically or, preferably, electro-mechanically driven, in a
manner similar to that described hereinbefore in connection with the most preferred embodiment of the invention as illustrated in FIGS. 1-11A.  Illustrative electro-mechanical drive components for this second embodiment of the invention preferably
comprise, for each air deflection element 336, a reversible drive motor 378 adapted to impart rotational motion to a threaded spindle 380, which extends from the drive shaft (not shown) of drive motor 378, and which, at its other end distal from drive
motor 378, is journaled for rotation in an angle bracket 382.  The drive components also comprise a drive block 384, adapted for movement along spindle 380 via an internally threaded bore 386 adapted to accept and to allow rotation of spindle 380; drive
block 384 is also adapted to slide along mounting plate 342, with feet 385 engaged with longitudinal restraining rails 347 that are affixed to mounting plate 342, illustratively via bolts or rivets 349, thus constraining the path of drive block 384 along
mounting plate 342.
 The drive components for this second embodiment further comprise a separate drive arm 387, which may be coupled by any suitable means to air deflection element 336 at a point approximately midway between the forward edge 338a and the trailing
edge 340 of the air deflection element.  Illustratively, as shown best in FIG. 32 (for upper air deflection element 336a), drive arm 387 is pierced adjacent its distal end 387a, while the under surface 356 of air deflection element 336 carries an
associated projection, preferably comprising an angle bracket 389, which is also pierced and which is rotatably coupled to drive arm 387 adjacent distal end 387a in a conventional fashion via a hinge pin 391.  Drive arm 387 may also be coupled by any
suitable means at its other end to drive block 384; illustratively, drive arm 387 is pierced adjacent its proximal end 387b and is rotatably coupled to drive block 384 via a hinge pin 393, as shown best in FIG. 33.
 When the drive motor 378 is energized by a control unit (not shown in the drawings), the spindle 380 rotates, which causes drive block 384 (starting from the position shown in FIG. 32) to begin moving towards the rear of the vehicle (to the
right as shown in the drawings), sliding along mounting plate 342.  This motion exerts a force on drive arm 387, as indicated by arrow M in FIG. 35, compelling drive arm 387 to exert a similar force on the associated air deflection element 336
(illustratively in FIG. 32, upper air deflection element 336a), and causing the latter to move away from the vehicle body and towards the rear of the vehicle as front pivot arms 350 and rear pivot arms 352 rotate (in a clockwise fashion, from the
perspective shown in the drawings), until drive block 384 has traveled to the opposite end of spindle 380 and the drive components have reached the positions shown in FIG. 34, at which point the associated air deflection element 336 is in the deployed
position (illustrated therein for upper air deflection element 336a).  When the drive motor 378 is energized with the opposite rotation, the associated air deflection element 336 is pulled by drive arm 387 and begins to move towards the front of the
vehicle and towards the vehicle body as front pivot arms 350 and rear pivot arms 352 rotate (in a counterclockwise fashion, from the perspective shown in the drawings), causing the associated air deflection element 336 eventually to return to the fully
retracted position, illustrated (for upper air deflection element 336a) in FIG. 32.
 Preferably, drive arm 385 may be shaped so as to minimize aerodynamic drag in the direction of the airflow when the associated air deflection element 336 is in the deployed position (shown illustratively in connection with upper air deflection
element 336a in FIG. 34).  That preferable shape, which is similar to that described as preferable hereinbefore for front pivot arm 350, is ellipsoidal in cross-section as shown best in FIG. 36, allowing air to flow around drive arm 385 in the most
efficient fashion, as indicated by the arrows N in FIG. 36.
 It is to be understood that the same or similar control unit/circuitry, energy source, actuator switch and limit switches, as were described hereinbefore for use in connection with (i.e., to energize and de-energize) the drive motors 78 of the
most preferred embodiment of the invention (which was described hereinbefore, and illustrated in FIGS. 1-22), may be used with equal advantage in connection with (i.e., to energize and de-energize) the drive motors 378 of this second embodiment of the
invention (described above, and illustrated in FIGS. 26-36).
 Thus, it will be evident from the foregoing description and from the drawings of this second embodiment of the invention, that when the vehicle is moving at any speed, it is possible, by deploying the air deflection elements 336 in the manner
illustrated in FIG. 30 or 34, to cause most of the airflow originating along the top and sides of the vehicle to be diverted into the area behind the vehicle, by being ""ducted"" or ""scooped"" between the air deflection elements 336 and the vehicle body, as
well as by being ""bent"" over and around the air deflection elements 336, thus utilizing both the inner and outer surfaces of each air deflection element simultaneously, with the contribution of each component of the diversion varying, depending upon the
extent of the deployment.  Thus, the drag associated with the area of low pressure which develops behind the vehicle is reduced, while at the same time, the drag associated with the breakdown of the laminar air flow along the top and sides of the vehicle
is also reduced, and the latter component of the drag is reduced whether the air deflection elements 336 of this second embodiment are deployed or remain fully retracted.
 As shown in the drawings, it is also to be understood that this second embodiment of the invention also preferably comprises, for each air deflection element 336, end walls 343 and a plurality of LEDs 402, similar to the end walls 43 and the
LEDs 102 depicted in connection with the most preferred embodiment of the invention described hereinbefore.  As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the LEDs 402 may be positioned adjacent the trailing edge 340 in an array which preferably
reproduces both the number and positions of the vehicle's native marker lights 335, and which may be illuminated, either automatically or manually by the driver of the vehicle, in the same manner in which the vehicle's native marker lights 335 are
normally illuminated.
 Referring now to FIGS. 37-44 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-36, a number of variations and/or optional features that may be incorporated into the retractable air deflection apparatus of the present invention are illustrated.  As shown
in FIGS. 37 and 38, and as mentioned hereinbefore, each air deflection element may be provided at its trailing edge with a small, upturned reflex extension or tail lip, with which the laminar flow over the air deflection element can be further improved. 
FIG. 37 depicts this tail lip 341 in conjunction with an air deflection element 336 that is otherwise in accordance with the second embodiment of the invention shown in FIGS. 26-36, while FIG. 38 illustrates a similar tail lip 41 in conjunction with an
air deflection element 36 that is otherwise in accordance with the most preferred embodiment of the invention shown in FIGS. 1-22.  Tail lip 41 is preferably formed integrally with air deflection element 36, and similarly, tail lip 341 is preferably
formed integrally with air deflection element 336; in both cases, the point at which the tail lip is joined to the air deflection element can exhibit either a curve or an angular bend, with the angle of the upturn being no greater than about
twenty-thirty degrees.
 As mentioned hereinbefore, each air deflection element is dimensioned to extend from its leading edge to its trailing edge for a distance that is preferably dependent on the length of the box-shaped portion of the vehicle on which it is mounted,
ranging from two percent to four percent, and most preferably three percent, of that length.  FIG. 39 illustrates these variations in the width span diagrammatically, with double-headed arrow O representing the maximum preferred width (typically
approximately eighteen inches) for an air deflection element when used in the typical long-haul vehicular environment, while double-headed arrow P represents an intermediate preferred width (typically approximately twelve inches) for an air deflection
element when used in the typical medium-haul vehicular environment, and double-headed arrow Q represents the minimum preferred width (typically approximately eight inches) for an air deflection element when used in the typical short-haul vehicular
environment.
 FIGS. 40 and 41 depict the underside 356 of a typical air deflection element 336 having an upturned tail lip 341, although FIG. 41 (along with FIG. 42) shows that the underside 356 may carry an additional optional feature, specifically an
electrical heating element 365 sealed within or covered by a protective layer 367, and preferred for use with vehicles operated in colder climates so as to warm the air deflection element as necessary to melt snow and/or ice that may have accumulated on
the vehicle when it is stationary (e.g., after having been parked overnight), or to prevent snow and/or ice from accumulating on the air deflection element while the vehicle is traveling (whether the air deflection element is retracted or deployed while
the vehicle is in transit) during inclement weather.  The heating element 365 may be energized remotely, through a control unit (not shown in the drawings) to which the heating element is connected via wires 369, the control unit having a switch that can
be operated either by the driver of the vehicle, or otherwise from the passenger compartment, as is conventional for other vehicular de-icing heating elements of this type (such as those embedded in the rear windows of passenger vehicles).  As shown in
FIG. 41, the heating element 365 is preferably coiled or snaked such that it covers substantially the entire underside 356 of air deflection element 336, save for the areas in the vicinity of angle brackets 358, 364 and 389.
 FIGS. 43-44 illustrate a feature that is preferred for inclusion in most installations of the retractable air deflection apparatus of the present invention, particularly when it is used in long-haul and medium-haul vehicular environments, but
which nevertheless may be omitted in certain short-haul vehicular environments, and therefore should be considered optional.  This feature relates to the provision of rear pivot arms for each air deflection element that are of variable length, thus
allowing the position of the trailing edge of each air deflection element to be adjusted independently of, and without substantially changing or affecting, the position of the leading edge of that air deflection element.  As a result, each air deflection
element can be deployed such that its trailing edge is positioned further away from the vehicle body than its leading edge.
 Specifically, and as shown schematically in FIGS. 43 and 44 (illustratively in connection with the upper air deflection element 336a of the second embodiment of the invention and, also illustratively, without any drive components, substantially
as depicted in FIGS. 29 and 30), the rear pivot arm 352 may comprise an outer sleeve 357 and an inner projection 359 that is slidably disposable within outer sleeve 357 (the projection 359 having an outside dimension that is slightly less than the inside
dimension of outer sleeve 357), as well as a device, generally designated 394, for extending the inner projection 359.  Preferably, extension device 394 is attached to, or is positioned adjacent to, but in any event is situated externally of, rear pivot
arm 352.  As illustrated, extension device 394 comprises a piston rod 396 that is pneumatically or hydraulically driven, and that is adapted to extend from and return into a cylinder 398, as indicated by the double-headed arrow R in FIG. 43, in response
to actuation by a control unit (not shown), with the piston rod being attached to inner projection 359 via a peg 397.  However, an extension device that comprises an electrically-driven, externally-threaded shaft or screw, that can extend from and return
into an internally-threaded cylindrical housing, or other arrangements that utilize a solenoid release, are also possible and are within the scope of the invention.
 When this optional feature is used, it will be evident to those skilled in the art that if one of the rear pivot arms that is coupled to and supports a given air deflection element is of variable length, then all of the rear pivot arms that are
coupled to and support that air deflection element must be of variable length, and must be configured such that their lengths vary in concert.  Although the provision of an extension device 394 on only one of the rear pivot arms 352 may suffice to
achieve this result, it is preferred that each rear pivot arm carry its own extension device 394, with the extension devices being configured such that they are actuated (and de-actuated) simultaneously, in order to reduce any resulting stresses on the
air deflection element itself.
 As best shown by comparing FIGS. 29 and 30 with FIG. 43, the provision of rear pivot arms that are of variable length allows upper air deflection element 336a to be deployed with a ""reverse angle,"" such that trailing edge 340 is situated further
above the upper surface of the vehicle than forward edge 338a.  This ""reverse angle"" deployment can be achieved first by moving upper air deflection element 336a from the retracted position shown in FIG. 29 to the deployed position shown in FIG. 30, and
then by actuating extension device 394 via a control unit (not shown in the drawings) so as to extend inner projection 359 of rear pivot arm 352 while at the same time moving upper air deflection element 336a back towards its retracted position, the
movements of the front and rear pivot arms 350, 352 being indicated by double-headed arrows S and T, respectively.  Thereafter, the position of trailing edge 340 can be adjusted more precisely, in the manner indicated by double-headed arrow U, by using
extension device 394 to modify the length of rear pivot arm 352 still further.
 Preferably, rear pivot arm 352 may also be shaped so as to minimize aerodynamic drag in the direction of the airflow when the associated air deflection element 336 is deployed in the ""reverse angle"" position.  That preferable shape, which is
similar to that described as preferable hereinbefore for front pivot arm 350, is ellipsoidal in cross-section, allowing air to flow around rear pivot arm 352 in the most efficient fashion, and as shown best in FIG. 44, both outer sleeve 357 and inner
projection 359 would be fashioned such that they have that same ellipsoidal shape.
 The ""reverse angle"" deployment of upper air deflection element 336a serves to alleviate the problems caused by the lifting force that is normally exerted on the vehicle body (in accordance with Bernoulli's Principle, as mentioned hereinbefore)
when it is traveling at high speeds, by providing a counteracting downward force that results in added stability for the vehicle, especially when adverse weather conditions are prevalent.  Hence, the optional provision of rear pivot arms having variable
lengths would be most useful in long-haul and medium-haul vehicular environments, and even then, only for the upper air deflection element of the vehicle.  Thus, it would be unnecessary to provide rear pivot arms having variable lengths on the side air
deflection elements except, as will now be described, in vehicular environments comprising multiple box-shaped container units, such as combination or ""tandem"" tractor-trailer assemblies comprising a cab hauling two or even three box-shaped trailers in
""daisy chain"" fashion, as well as a succession of adjacent, squared-off railroad cars (regardless of whether those rail cars are used for carrying passengers or freight); these types of vehicular environments will be referred to collectively hereinafter
as a ""tandem"" vehicular environment.
 Referring now to FIGS. 45 and 46 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-44, the provision of variable length rear pivot arms on the upper air deflection element, as well as on both of the side air deflection elements, in a tandem vehicular
environment, is depicted in connection with an air deflection element 36 of the most preferred embodiment of the invention (illustratively with electro-mechanical drive components, substantially as shown in FIGS. 1-11A, but also with an upturned tail lip
41, as shown in FIG. 38).  Specifically, FIGS. 45-46 depict how the variable length rear pivot arms allow the air deflection elements on the rear edges of the first (or one of the intermediate) units, of a vehicle having multiple successive adjacent
box-shaped container units, to be deployed for the most aerodynamic benefit during travel, it being understood that FIGS. 45-46 can be taken either as views, from the side, of an upper air deflection element, or as views, from above, of the right side
air deflection element.
 In FIG. 45, air deflection element 36 is shown in the fully retracted position, with dimension V representing the typical distance or ""gap"" between one box-shaped container unit 450 (the leading container unit) and an adjacent, box-shaped,
trailing container unit 452; the value of dimension V varies depending on the particular tandem vehicular environment, with twenty-four inches being typical for tandem tractor-trailer assemblies, while thirty inches is more typical for freight-carrying
rail boxcars.
 In order to reach the position shown in FIG. 46, air deflection element 36 is first deployed in the fashion described hereinbefore in connection with FIGS. 1-11A, but some time before the position is reached that is shown in phantom lines in
FIG. 46 (which corresponds substantially to the position shown in solid lines in FIG. 11), the extension device (not shown in FIGS. 45 and 46) is actuated by a control unit (which again is not shown in the drawings) so as to extend inner projection 59 of
rear pivot arm 52, while at the same time further deployment is continued, thereby moving the trailing edge 40 (and the tail lip 41) of air deflection element 36 further outwards from the leading container unit 450 as compared with its position as shown
in phantom lines in FIG. 46, such that the imaginary chord (not shown) of each air deflection element (when considered as an airfoil) is substantially parallel either to the top or to one of the sides of both the leading container unit 450 and the
trailing container unit 452.  As a result of a relatively small change in the length of the variable length rear pivot arm 52, illustratively represented in FIG. 46 by the difference between the dimension W and the distance between the arrows X, the air
deflection element 36 is thus essentially caused to pivot about the hinge pin 60.
 As shown in solid lines in FIG. 46, each air deflection element is thereby caused to span a substantial portion of the ""gap"" (represented by the dimension V in FIG. 45) between the adjacent container bodies, except for a narrow opening
(represented by the dimension V' in FIG. 46) which is needed in order to avoid potentially damaging contact between the air deflection element 36 and the front edge 461 of the trailing container unit 452, as the air deflection element is being deployed
or retracted.  Such damaging contact is also possible, in the case of the side air deflection elements only, when during the course of travel the vehicle turns to that same side, thus temporarily reducing (for the duration of the turn) the separation
between the adjacent container bodies on the side that constitutes the ""inside"" of the turn, while temporarily increasing that separation on the side that constitutes the ""outside"" of the turn.
 However, optionally, and most preferably, the risk of contact between one of the side air deflection elements and the trailing container unit 452, even during a relatively sharp turn, can be eliminated by allowing for a slight additional or
further extension and then a slight contraction or shortening of the rear pivot arms (of only one side air deflection element or the other), in a dynamic fashion (and preferably automatically) as the vehicle turns, and only for the duration of the turn,
so as to briefly force further outwards the trailing edge 40 of the air deflection element that is on the ""inside"" of the turn.
 In any event, the result of the deployment of the air deflection elements 36 as shown in FIG. 46 is that the body of each air deflection element shields the ""gap"" (represented by the dimension V in FIG. 45), with the air deflection elements thus
serving to avoid or reduce the turbulence normally attributable to the breakdown in laminar air flow between adjacent container bodies in the tandem vehicular environment, by maintaining that laminar air flow over most of the dimension V, with the tail
lip 41 serving to deflect the air flow and to direct it slightly away from the remaining opening between the container bodies (represented by the dimension V'), such that as the air flow continues past the trailing edge 40 of the air deflection element,
it will not be directed into that opening.  In those installations not including a tail lip 41, the variable length rear pivot arms can alternatively be extended slightly further than as shown in FIG. 46, such that the imaginary chord (not shown) of each
air deflection element is oriented slightly beyond parallel to the vehicle body, and so that the air deflection elements themselves deflect the air flow outwardly and away from the remaining opening (represented by the dimension V') between the container
bodies.
 As mentioned hereinbefore in conjunction with the control units (not shown in the drawings) for power-assisted deployment and retraction of the air deflection elements in a remote fashion from the cab of the vehicle, optionally, but more
preferably, sensors are used to provide a remote indication in the cab of the current positions of each of the air deflection elements.  In order to determine the position of each air deflection element precisely, two sensors are needed, one angular or
rotary sensor and one linear position sensor, although the latter is needed only if a particular air deflection element is provided with variable length rear pivot arms.  While these sensors are too small to be seen in the drawings, the most preferred
locations for them are indicated below, illustratively for the rotary sensor in connection with the most preferred embodiment of the invention shown in FIGS. 1-22, and illustratively for the linear position sensor in connection with the second embodiment
of the invention shown in FIGS. 26-36 and 43-44; however, it is to be understood that these sensors may be situated in the respective corresponding locations in connection with either of the embodiments of the invention described thus far and illustrated
in FIGS. 1-46.
 Specifically, in order to determine the extent of deployment of any of the air deflection elements described thus far, a commercially-available rotary sensor may be placed adjacent the proximal end 50b of one of the front pivot arms 50, where
the latter is coupled to mounting plate 42, such that the angle between the front pivot arm and the upper surface 18 is measured, although it is also possible to place the rotary sensor adjacent the proximal end 52b of one of the rear pivot arms 52,
where the latter is coupled to angle bracket 74.  A preferred rotary sensor for use with the present invention is available from Novotechnik U.S., Inc.  of Southborough, Mass., U.S.A., which markets a several such sensors under the model designation
AW360 ZE.  Furthermore, in order to determine the extent to which the variable length rear pivot arms have been extended, a commercially-available linear position sensor may be placed on or adjacent the extension device 394.  A preferred linear position
sensor for use with the present invention is available, also from Novotechnik U.S., Inc., which markets such sensors under the model designation TLM.  The output of the rotary sensor can be utilized alone or, in cases in which at least one air deflection
element is equipped with variable length rear pivot arms, in combination with the output of the linear position sensor, in a manner which is well known in the art, to provide an indication (either analog or digital) of the position of the air deflection
element, on a suitably calibrated readout device (not shown in the drawings) located in the cab of the vehicle, preferably in the vicinity of the actuator switch (which is also not shown in the drawings).
 Referring next to FIGS. 47-50 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-46, another alternative, but also still preferred, embodiment of the retractable air deflection apparatus of the present invention will now be described, illustratively in
conjunction with a long-haul vehicular environment exemplified by the same tractor-trailer 12 as shown in FIGS. 1-22.  In this third embodiment, there are significant differences in the air deflection elements themselves, and in the structures that
support and link each air deflection element to the vehicle body, as well as in the manner in which each air deflection element is deployed and retracted, as compared with the embodiments described previously.  However, this embodiment preferably does
include drive components to assist with the deployment and retraction of the air deflection elements.
 In this embodiment, the air deflection apparatus 510 comprises at least one, and preferably at least three, air deflection elements 536 (one upper air deflection element and two side air deflection elements, as with the embodiments described
hereinbefore).  As shown in FIGS. 47-49, each air deflection element 536 comprises an outer housing member 537, which is closed except for a rear transverse opening 537b, and an inner elongating member 539.  Both the housing member 537 and the elongating
member 539 generally have an airfoil geometry, the shapes of which, when the elongating member 539 is positioned as shown in FIG. 49, may be symbolized by the modified four-digit NACA numbers 7504-01 and/or 7504-11.  Elongating member 539 is slidably
disposed within housing member 537 in a ""nested"" fashion (the elongating member 539 generally having outside dimensions that are slightly less than the corresponding inside dimensions of housing member 537), as best shown in FIGS. 47 and 49,
illustratively in connection with upper air deflection element 536a.
 Housing member 537 comprises an outer wall 571 and an inner wall 573, which are shaped so as to maintain substantially the same distance between them, but to converge towards one another at the rear, such that housing member 537 tapers gradually
near its trailing edge (the latter being located adjacent opening 537b).  Along both ends, which are closed by end walls 543, housing member 537 is provided with a guide element 595, having a channel 599 with which the sides of elongating member 539
engage, as shown best in FIG. 48.  Elongating member 539 preferably further comprises an upturned tail lip 541, and as with the embodiments described hereinbefore, each air deflection element 536 is preferably associated with a mounting plate 542 that is
affixed to the vehicle body.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 47-49 in connection with upper air deflection element 536a (installed transversely across the upper surface 518 of the vehicle, adjacent and substantially parallel to the upper trailing corner edge 528, and preferably
extending horizontally across the entire width of the vehicle, substantially from corner to corner), each air deflection element 536 is coupled to the vehicle body (either directly, or more preferably, through mounting plate 542) by a plurality of
leading support legs 550 and a plurality of trailing support legs 552, each of which can be of fixed length, but each of which is, more preferably, of variable length.  Each support leg 550, 552 of variable length comprises an outer sleeve element 557
and a inner extendable element 559 that is slidably disposable within outer sleeve element 557 (the extendable element 559 having an outside dimension that is slightly less than the inside dimension of outer sleeve element 557), as well as a device (not
shown in the drawings) for elongating the inner extendable element 559 in a sectional, ""telescoping"" fashion, in a manner that is well known in the art.
 The leading and trailing support legs 550, 552 may be coupled by any suitable means to air deflection element 536 at points near the leading edge 538 and the trailing edge 540, respectively, of the air deflection element.  Illustratively, as
shown best in FIG. 49 in connection with upper air deflection element 536a, the inner extendable element 559 of each leading support leg 550 is pierced adjacent its distal end, while the under surface 556 of air deflection element 536a (which is also the
inner surface of inner wall 573) carries an associated leading projection, preferably comprising an angle bracket 558, which is also pierced and which is coupled to extendable element 559 of leading support leg 550 in a conventional fashion via a
connecting pin 560.  Similarly, the inner extendable element 559 of each trailing support leg 552 is pierced adjacent its distal end, while the under surface 556 of air deflection element 536a (which, again, is also the inner surface of inner wall 573)
carries an associated trailing projection, preferably comprising an angle bracket 564, which is also pierced and which is coupled to extendable element 559 of trailing support leg 552 in a conventional fashion via a connecting pin 566.  As shown best in
FIG. 49, the aforementioned gradual convergence of outer wall 571 and inner wall 573 towards one another preferably encompasses only the region of housing member 537 near its trailing edge, most preferably only between support leg 552 and opening 537b.
 Each support leg 550, 552 may also be shaped so as to minimize aerodynamic drag in the direction of the airflow.  As illustrated in FIG. 50 in connection with a leading support leg 550, that preferable shape, which is similar to that described
as preferable hereinbefore, is ellipsoidal in cross-section, allowing air to flow around each support leg in the most efficient fashion, as indicated by the arrows Y, and as shown best in FIG. 50, outer sleeve element 557 and each section of inner
extendable element 559 are fashioned such that they have that same ellipsoidal shape.
 Turning now to FIGS. 51-54 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-53, the air deflection apparatus 510 of this third embodiment of the invention may optionally comprise power-assisted drive components with which the elongating member 539 of
each air deflection element 536 may be deployed and retracted, and caused to assume differing positions of deployment.  These drive components may be remotely controlled, and may be hydraulically, pneumatically or, preferably, electro-mechanically
driven, in a manner that is generally similar to that described hereinbefore in connection with the most preferred embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in FIGS. 1-11A, and also generally similar to that described hereinbefore in connection with
the second embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in FIGS. 32-36, but with somewhat different drive components than those described in connection with either of those embodiments.
 Illustrative electro-mechanical drive components for this third embodiment of the invention preferably comprise, for each air deflection element 536, a reversible drive motor 578 situated within housing member 537, and adapted to impart
rotational motion to toothed drive gear 580, which extends from the drive shaft 579 of drive motor 578.  As best shown in FIGS. 51 and 52, drive motor 578 is attached to the leading edge 539a of elongating member 539 via a supporting bracket 581, and the
drive components further comprise a gear track 583 mounted on the inside surface of inner wall 573 of housing member 537 and preferably positioned substantially along the imaginary center line of each air deflection element 536, oriented along the
direction of travel of the vehicle (as shown in phantom lines in FIG. 47).  Gear track 583 is adapted for mating engagement with drive gear 580 in a well known manner.
 FIGS. 51-52 depict the configuration of the aforementioned drive components when the associated air deflection element is in the fully retracted position, which position is illustrated, for upper air deflection element 536a, in FIGS. 47-49. 
When drive motor 578 is energized by a control unit (not shown in the drawings), the drive gear 580 rotates (in a clockwise manner, from the perspective shown in FIG. 51, as indicated by the arrow Z), which causes drive gear 580 to begin to travel or
""walk"" along gear track 583, moving towards the rear of the vehicle (to the right from the perspective shown in FIG. 52, as indicated by the arrow AA) and constraining elongating member 539 to move in that direction as well, as indicated by the arrows BB
in FIGS. 51-54, thereby deploying elongating member 539 from the rear of housing member 537 through opening 537b and increasing the overall size of associated air deflection element 536 to any desired degree, up to the fully deployed position
(illustrated in FIGS. 53 and 54 for upper air deflection element 536a).  Since the deployment of elongating member 539 changes the overall shape or geometry of air deflection element 536, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the modified
four-digit NACA numbers set forth above as symbolizing the shape of air deflection element 536 when elongating member 539 is fully retracted (as illustrated in FIG. 49), can not also be used to represent that shape when elongating member 539 is deployed;
in the latter configuration, when the elongating member 539 is fully deployed, particularly as illustrated in FIG. 54, the shape of air deflection element 536 may be symbolized by the modified four-digit NACA numbers 2503-01 and/or 2503-11.
 As will be evident to those skilled in the art, when the drive motor 578 is thereafter energized with the opposite rotation, the movements of the drive components as described above will be reversed, thus causing the elongating member 539 to
begin to move towards the front of the vehicle and to retract into housing member 537, such that it eventually returns to the fully retracted position illustrated in FIGS. 47-49 for upper air deflection element 536a, thereby resulting in an overall
diminution in the size of air deflection element 536.  It will also be evident to those skilled in the art that it may be necessary to provide a roller or guide or some other element within housing member 537 in order to prevent drive gear 580 from
disengaging from gear track 583 as the former travels or ""walks"" along the latter during these operations.
 As stated above, the air deflection elements 536 of this third embodiment of the invention are preferably coupled to the vehicle body via support legs 550, 552, each of which, by virtue of its ""telescoping"" inner extendable element 559, is of
variable length.  However, it is to be understood that for a given air deflection element 536, most preferably the inner extendable elements 559 of all of the leading support legs 550 are extendable in concert with one another, and the inner extendable
elements 559 of all of the trailing support legs 552 are also extendable in concert with one another, although separately from, i.e., not necessarily in concert with, the extendable elements 559 of the leading support legs 550.  As illustrated in FIG.
54, this arrangement enables the trailing support legs 552 to be extended (in the direction indicated by arrow CC in FIG. 54) without extending leading support legs 550, but as illustrated in FIG. 53, this arrangement also enables both the leading
support legs 550 and the trailing support legs 552 to be extended at the same time (and substantially to the same degree, in the direction indicated by the arrows CC in FIG. 53).  Thus, by varying the degree of extension of the leading support legs 550
and the trailing support legs 552, the angle at which the air deflection element 536 may be deployed may be varied somewhat by the user.
 It will therefore be evident from the foregoing description and from the drawings of this third embodiment of the invention, that when the vehicle is moving at low and moderate speeds, it is still possible, by deploying the air deflection
elements 536 in the manner illustrated in FIG. 53, with both the leading support legs 550 and the trailing support legs 552 extended, to cause most of the airflow originating along the top and sides of the vehicle to be diverted into the area behind the
vehicle, by being ""ducted"" or ""scooped"" between the air deflection elements 536 and the vehicle body, as well as by being ""bent"" over and around the air deflection elements 536, thus utilizing both the inner and outer surfaces of each air deflection
element simultaneously, with the contribution of each component of the diversion varying, depending upon the degree to which the leading support legs 550 are extended.
 On the other hand, when the vehicle is moving at high speeds, it is still possible, by deploying the air deflection elements 536 in the manner illustrated in FIG. 54, with only the trailing support legs 552 extended, to cause most of the airflow
originating along the top and sides of the vehicle to be diverted into the area behind the vehicle, by being ""bent"" over and around the air deflection elements 536, thus utilizing primarily the outer surface of each air deflection element.  However, once
again, in all cases the drag associated with the area of low pressure which develops behind the vehicle is reduced, while at the same time, the drag associated with the breakdown of the laminar airflow along the top and sides of the vehicle is also
reduced, and the latter component of the drag is reduced whether the air deflection elements 536 of this third embodiment are deployed or remain fully retracted (with none of the support legs extended, as illustrated in FIG. 49).  In addition, with this
third embodiment of the invention it is also still possible, when the upper air deflection element 536a is deployed in the manner illustrated in FIG. 54, to provide a moderate downward force that results in the added stability for the vehicle discussed
hereinbefore in connection with FIG. 43.
 FIGS. 53 and 54 also illustrate how the gradual tapering of housing member 537 near its trailing edge, between support leg 552 and opening 537b as mentioned hereinbefore, minimizes any disruption in the airflow over (and, in the case of FIG. 53,
under) air deflection element 536 that might otherwise occur at the juncture of housing member 537 and elongating member 539 (when the latter is extended or deployed) in the absence of such tapering.  Although the minimization of any such disruption in
the airflow by means of this gradual tapering of housing member 537 is most preferred, it is to be understood that the airflow disruption at the juncture of housing member 537 and elongating member 539 (when the latter is extended or deployed) can be
minimized in other ways.  For example, if housing member 537 is constructed without any such tapering, then a preferred alternative is to construct elongating member 539 with a gradual taper, specifically, so that its thickness gradually increases
towards the edge nearest the front of the vehicle (this taper is not shown in the drawings), so as to provide the necessary smooth (rather than abrupt) transition from the outer surface of housing member 537 to the outer surface of elongating member 539
when elongating member is fully extended (as illustrated in FIGS. 53 and 54).
 Another preferred alternative would be to provide a transitional flexible, tapering extension (also not shown in the drawings), which would preferably be fabricated of the synthetic fibers marketed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of
Wilmington, Del., U.S.A.  under the trademark KEVLAR, although other materials having similar characteristics could be used instead.  This flexible extension would preferably overlap, and would be attached in a permanent fashion to, the rear portion of
housing member 537, near its trailing edge and adjacent to opening 537b, and would extend rearwardly, such that when elongating member 539 is deployed, the flexible extension would also overlap elongating member 539, and would thereby provide the
necessary smooth (rather than abrupt) transition from the outer surface of housing member 537 to the outer surface of elongating member 539, and thus minimize any disruption in the airflow.
 Referring now to FIGS. 55-59 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-54, this third embodiment of the invention may instead comprise drive components with which the air deflection elements 536 may be deployed and retracted (and caused to
assume differing positions of deployment) through manual manipulation, using a tool that is specially designed for that purpose.
 As shown best in FIG. 55, the drive components for manual deployment are preferably situated within housing member 537.  More particularly, these drive components are preferably positioned substantially along the imaginary center line of each
air deflection element 536, oriented along the direction of travel of the vehicle, and they illustratively comprise, for each air deflection element 536, as shown in FIGS. 55-59 (illustratively for upper air deflection element 536a), a pulley system 610
including a pulley cable 112, having a trailing end 614 and a leading end 616, and enclosing a release cable 618, having a trailing end 620 and a leading end 622.  Release cable 618 is slidably disposed coaxially within pulley cable 612, with sufficient
clearance therebetween to allow each cable to be moved longitudinally, independently of one another.  Release cable 618 may be fabricated of a flexible metal wire or chain, or sturdy rope or twine, or of another natural or synthetic material, as is well
known in the art.
 At its leading end 616, pulley cable 612 terminates at an end guide 624, and at its trailing end 614, pulley cable 612 terminates at an end guide 626.  As shown best in FIG. 59, end guide 626 is mounted on the outer surface 628 of elongating
member 539, slightly forward of tail lip 541, and has an aperture (not shown) so as to allow release cable 618 to pass therethrough and to emerge from pulley cable 612, extending beyond the trailing end 614 thereof.  End guide 626 is preferably
positioned adjacent an aperture 631 in elongating member 539, through which release cable 618 extends, such that release cable 618 is accessible and manipulable from the rear of the vehicle, as will be described hereinafter; for this purpose, release
cable 618 terminates at its trailing end 620 in an O-ring 634.  End guide 624 is also mounted on the outer surface 628 of elongating member 539, slightly rearward of its leading edge 539a.  As shown best in FIGS. 57 and 58, an aperture 633 located in end
guide 624 is adapted to receive the leading end 616 of pulley cable 612, and to allow release cable 618 to pass therethrough and to emerge from pulley cable 612, extending beyond the leading end 616 thereof.
 Release cable 618, at its leading end 622, is tethered to an air deflection element position adjustment assembly 636, which is adapted to reciprocate between a locked position, depicted most clearly in FIG. 57, and a released or unlocked
position, depicted most clearly in FIG. 58, in a manner to be described in further detail hereinafter.  The air deflection element position adjustment assembly 636 illustratively includes a tapering cam 635 that is pivotally attached to the leading edge
539a of elongating member 539 via a hinge pin 637 that journaled for rotation in brackets 639; at its tapered extremity 635a, tapering cam 635 carries an illustratively circular locking peg 641.  An aperture 643, located in tapering cam 635, is adapted
to receive the leading end 622 of release cable 618.
 The air deflection element position adjustment assembly 636 also illustratively includes a locking track 645, disposed on the inner wall 573 of housing member 537 and carrying a plurality of illustratively circular locking apertures 647, all
substantially of the same diameter, provided at regular intervals along locking track 645 for substantially its entire length and positioned substantially along its center line in an aligned fashion, as shown best in FIG. 56; each locking aperture 647 is
adapted for engagement with locking peg 641, as shown best in FIG. 57.  The number of locking apertures 647 can be chosen to correspond to the number of discrete positions that are desired for manual deployment of the elongating member 539 of the
associated air deflection element 536; preferably, as illustrated in FIGS. 56-58, there are a multiplicity of such apertures 647.  The bias of return spring 649 urges tapering cam 635 in the direction indicated by arrow DD in FIG. 58, towards locking
track 645, such that locking peg 639 is urged into engagement with one of the locking apertures 647, as shown in solid lines in FIG. 57 and in phantom lines in FIG. 58.  The air deflection element position adjustment assembly 636 further includes a
return spring 649, coiled around the portion of release cable 618 that is disposed between end guide 626 and tapering cam 635.
 The special tool, that is designed for use with the manual drive components just described, comprises an adjusting pole 686, shown in FIGS. 55 and 59, carrying a curved hook element 710 and a knobbed hook element 712 which together enable
substantially simultaneous manipulation not only of the release cable 618, but also the elongating member 539 of the associated air deflection element 536; for this purpose, an illustrative extension 688 is provided, which depends from the tail lip 541
of each air deflection element 536, with an aperture 690 in extension 688 that is preferably positioned substantially along the imaginary center line of the air deflection element 536.  Curved hook element 710 is adapted for engagement with the O-ring
634 at the trailing end 620 of release cable 618, while knobbed hook element 712 is adapted for engagement with the aperture 690 in extension 688 of tail lip 541.
 The adjusting pole 686 is substantially identical to the adjusting pole 186 illustrated in FIGS. 12-14 and described hereinbefore for use in conjunction with the most preferred embodiment of the invention, and is used in substantially the same
way so as to actuate the manual drive components for deployment (or retraction) of the air deflection elements 536, first by manipulating adjusting pole 686 so as to displace release cable 618 (as indicated by the arrow EE in FIG. 59), so that the
tapering cam 635 is caused to pivot against the return spring 649, thereby unlocking or releasing air deflection element position adjustment assembly 636 and causing locking peg 641 to be withdrawn from engagement with one of the locking apertures 647
(as shown in solid lines in FIG. 58), then by further manipulating adjusting pole 686 (as indicated by double-headed arrow FF in FIG. 59) so as to impart deploying (or retracting) motion (as indicated by the double-headed arrow GG in FIG. 59) to the
elongating member 539 of air deflection element 536 while maintaining the displacement of release cable 618, and thereafter by manipulating adjusting pole 686 still further so as to reverse the displacement of release cable 618 so that tapering cam 635
is urged by return spring 649 to pivot in the opposite direction, thereby forcing locking peg 641 into engagement with one of the other locking apertures 647 and consequently re-locking air deflection element position adjustment assembly 636 when the
desired degree of deployment (or retraction) is reached.
 Although not shown in the drawings, it is to be understood that this third embodiment of the invention also preferably includes, for each air deflection element 536 (specifically, for each elongating member 539), a plurality of LEDs similar to
those depicted in connection with the earlier embodiments of the invention described hereinbefore.  As will now be evident to those skilled in the art, these LEDs may be positioned adjacent the trailing edge 540 in an array which preferably reproduces
both the number and positions of the vehicle's native marker lights 535, and which may be illuminated, either automatically or manually by the driver of the vehicle, in the same manner in which the vehicle's native marker lights 535 are normally
illuminated.
 As mentioned previously, the invention preferably encompasses the use of sensors to provide a remote indication, preferably in the cab of the vehicle, of the current positions of each of the air deflection elements, so as to facilitate remote
deployment and retraction thereof.  In the case of this third embodiment of the invention, in order to determine the position of each air deflection element precisely, three sensors are needed, all of which are linear position sensors.  Although these
sensors are too small to be seen in the drawings, the most preferred locations for them will be described.
 Specifically, in order to determine the degree to which elongating member 539 is extended from the opening 537b at the rear of housing member 537, one such linear position sensor may be situated within housing member 537, between outer wall 571
and inner wall 573, adjacent to and slightly forward of the position occupied by leading edge 539a of elongating member 539 when the latter is fully retracted within housing member 537.  A preferred linear position sensor for use with this aspect of the
present invention is available from Celesco Transducer Products, Inc.  of Chatsworth, Calif., U.S.A., which markets such a sensor (also called a ""compact string encoder"") under the model designation SE1.  Similarly, in order to determine the extent to
which the variable length support legs 550, 552 have been extended, a linear position sensor such as the TLM product of Novotechnik U.S., Inc.  described hereinbefore may be placed on or adjacent the device (not shown in the drawings) for elongating the
inner extendable element 559 of each support leg in a ""telescoping"" fashion, although the use of a ""telescoping"" mechanism that is integrally equipped by the manufacturer with position length sensing is preferable; such mechanisms are widely available
commercially from several manufacturers.  The output of these sensors can be utilized in a manner which is well known in the art, to provide an indication (either analog or digital) of the position of the air deflection element, on a suitably calibrated
readout device (not shown in the drawings) located in the cab of the vehicle, preferably in the vicinity of the actuator switch (which is also not shown in the drawings).
 Each of the embodiments of the invention has thus far been described as preferably comprising three air deflection elements (one upper air deflection element and two side air deflection elements).  However, although not shown in the drawings, it
will be evident to those skilled in the art that for each embodiment described hereinbefore, it is within the scope of the invention to include a fourth air deflection element, substantially identical to the other air deflection elements, and
displaceable in unison with them between a retracted position and at least one deployed position, but mounted beneath the body of the vehicle and positioned adjacent its lower rear trailing edge (that edge is illustratively designated by the reference
numeral 34 in connection with the tractor-trailer 12 of FIGS. 1-2, and by the reference numeral 334 in connection with the box truck 312 of FIGS. 26-27).  The use and operation of such a lower air deflection element to divert the airflow along the
underside of the vehicle body would essentially be no different than the use and operation of the counterpart upper and side air deflection elements previously described.
 Nevertheless, and referring now to FIGS. 60-66 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-59, because many land transportation vehicles have a rear bumper and/or other features or equipment that may interfere with the deployment of such a lower
air deflection element, or that may make the positioning of such a lower air deflection element on the underside of the vehicle body adjacent its lower trailing corner edge impractical, an alternative structure for such an element will now be described.
 As shown in FIG. 60, the lower rear portion of a typical medium-haul vehicle 714 with which the present invention might be used (and which is similar to the vehicle 312 as shown in FIGS. 26-27) includes a left side air deflection element 36b, a
right side air deflection element 36c, and a lower air deflection element 736d (vehicle 714 may or may not also carry an upper air deflection element, which is not shown in FIG. 60).  For purposes of illustration, the left side and right side air
deflection elements are designated by reference numerals which indicate that they are in accordance with the most preferred embodiment of the invention described hereinbefore and shown in FIGS. 1-22, but it is to be understood that the left side and
right side air deflection elements may alternatively correspond with those indicated by the reference numerals 336b and 336c, respectively, in accordance with the second embodiment of the invention described hereinbefore and shown in FIGS. 26-36 and
43-44, or they may correspond with those indicated by the reference numerals 536b and 536c, respectively, in accordance with the third embodiment of the invention described hereinbefore and shown in FIGS. 47-59, and it will be understood by those skilled
in the art that if the vehicle is also equipped with an upper air deflection element, that element may also be in accordance with any one of the three embodiments of the invention described thus far.
 The left side and right side air deflection elements 36b and 36c are mounted vertically, along the left side surface 720 of the vehicle 714, adjacent and substantially parallel to the left side trailing corner edge 730, and on the right side
surface 721, adjacent and substantially parallel to the opposite, right side trailing corner edge 732, respectively, as has been described previously.  However, as shown in FIG. 60, the fourth, lower air deflection element 736d, instead of being mounted
on the underside of the vehicle body adjacent its lower trailing corner edge 734, is mounted horizontally, across the lower portion of rear-facing surface 722, beneath roll-up rear cargo door 724.
 Although when in the fully retracted position shown in FIG. 60, lower air deflection element 736d might cover and obscure the plurality of electrically-energized taillights 735 (e.g., brake lights, back-up lights, directional signal lights,
etc.) that are typically aligned transversely across the lower portion of rear-facing surface 722 of many vehicles, lower air deflection element 736d is provided with a plurality of light sources 802, which are positioned on the outer surface 737 of
lower air deflection element 736d, in an array which, as illustrated in FIG. 60, preferably reproduces both the number and positions (and most preferably even the colors) of the vehicle's native taillights 735, and which are preferably illuminated
automatically, in the same manner in which the vehicle's native taillights 735 are normally illuminated.  As will be apparent from the description below, when lower air deflection element 736d is deployed, the vehicle's native taillights will no longer
be obscured and will be visible to the drivers of following vehicles.
 Lower air deflection element 736d is preferably associated with, and when in the fully retracted position shown in FIG. 60 is disposed within, a mounting frame 742, which comprises a flat base portion 744 that is affixed to the lower portion of
rear-facing surface 722, as well as an upstanding partition portion 746 disposed at right angles to the base portion 744 and oriented along the direction of travel of the vehicle, extending rearwards and substantially surrounding lower air deflection
element 736d on four sides i.e., the partition portion 746 comprises an upper partition segment 746a that extends across the width of the vehicle, substantially from left side trailing corner edge 730 to right side trailing corner edge 732, just above
lower air deflection element 736d, a lower partition segment 746b which extends similarly across the width of the vehicle but just below lower air deflection element 736d, and two side partition elements, a left side partition segment 746c that extends
from and essentially connects the left end of partition segment 746a to the left end of partition segment 746b, and a right side partition segment 746d, that extends from and essentially connects the right end of upper partition segment 746a to the right
end of lower partition segment 746b, the four partition segments thus forming a substantially continuous, substantially rectangular, protective, frame-like border around lower air deflection element 736d, as shown best in FIG. 60.  Lower air deflection
element 736d preferably also comprises end walls 743, as well as down-turned reflex extension or tail lip 741.
 In order for lower air deflection element 736d to function properly, the airflow that passes under the vehicle body (and which normally flows just underneath the floor 717 of the vehicle's cargo compartment 716) must be directed such that it can
be intercepted and redirected by lower air deflection element 736d when the latter is deployed.  For that purpose, the vehicle is provided with a curved wind dam or wind fairing 719 which, when the vehicle is moving, directs the underside airflow towards
the lower trailing corner edge 734 of vehicle 714, as shown by the arrows HH in FIG. 61.
 FIGS. 62-66 illustrate the components of the preferred drive mechanism with which lower air deflection element 736d may be deployed and retracted, and caused to assume differing positions of deployment, FIG. 62 illustrating the positions of
those components when lower air deflection element 736d is in the fully retracted position; the drive components may be operated either manually or, more preferably, with powered assistance, and in the latter case, the drive components may be remotely
controlled, e.g., by the driver from the cab of the vehicle, as has already been described in detail hereinbefore in connection with the side (and upper) air deflection elements, and the drive components can be hydraulically, pneumatically or
electro-mechanically driven, also as has been described previously, although again as described in detail hereinbefore, the drive components are most preferably electro-mechanically driven, are remotely controlled, and are actuated by a control unit (not
shown in the drawings) in unison with the drive components for any other air deflection elements that may be installed on the vehicle.
 The drive components for lower air deflection element 736d are preferably situated on base portion 744 of mounting frame 742 and are preferably positioned substantially along the imaginary center line of lower air deflection element 736d.  The
illustrative electro-mechanical drive components preferably comprise a reversible drive motor 778 affixed to base portion 744 of mounting frame 742 via a mounting bracket 781, and adapted to impart rotational motion to a threaded spindle 780, which
extends from the drive shaft (not shown) of drive motor 778, and which, at its other end distal from drive motor 778, is journaled for rotation in an angle bracket 782 that is mounted on base portion 744 of mounting frame 742.  The drive components also
comprise a drive block 784, adapted for movement along spindle 780 via an internally threaded bore (not shown) adapted to accept and to allow rotation of spindle 780.
 The drive components further comprise a drive arm 787, which may be coupled by any suitable means to drive block 784; illustratively, drive arm 787 is pierced adjacent its proximal end 787b and is rotatably coupled to drive block 784 via a hinge
pin 789.  Drive arm 787 may also be coupled by any suitable means at its other end to lower air deflection element 736d at a point approximately one quarter of the way between the leading edge 738 and the trailing edge 740 of the lower air deflection
element; illustratively, drive arm 787 is pierced adjacent its distal end 787a, while the inner surface 756 of lower air deflection element 736d carries an associated projection, preferably comprising an angle bracket 791, which is also pierced and which
is rotatably coupled to drive arm 787 adjacent distal end 787a in a conventional fashion via a hinge pin 793.
 The drive components also comprise an additional mechanical linkage, illustratively a connector strut 830 of variable length.  As shown in FIGS. 62 and 63, connector strut 830 comprises an outer sleeve element 840 and a inner extendable element
842 that is slidably disposed within outer sleeve element 840 (the inner extendable element 842 having an outside dimension that is slightly less than the inside dimension of outer sleeve element 840, as shown best in FIG. 63), such that the inner
extendable element 842 can be withdrawn from outer sleeve element 840, thus allowing the length of connector strut 830 to vary in a manner that is well known in the art.
 Connector strut 830 has a distal end 830a and a proximal end 830b, and may be coupled, respectively, by any suitable means, to lower air deflection element 736d (at a point on its inner surface 756 situated approximately three quarters of the
way between its leading edge 738 and its trailing edge 740) and to drive arm 787.  Illustratively, connector strut 830 is pierced adjacent its distal end 830a, while the inner surface 756 of lower air deflection element 736d carries an associated
projection, preferably comprising an angle bracket 833, which is also pierced and which is rotatably coupled to connector strut 830 adjacent distal end 830a in a conventional fashion via a hinge pin 834.  The inner extendable element 842 of connector
strut 830 is also illustratively pierced adjacent its proximal end, while drive arm 787 is pierced at an intermediate point along its length, allowing drive arm 787 to be rotatably coupled to the inner extendable element 842 of connector strut 830
adjacent its proximal end in a conventional fashion via hinge pin 838.
 Apart from the drive components mentioned above, lower air deflection element 736d is also coupled to the vehicle body (through the base portion 744 of mounting frame 742) by at least one lower pivot arm 852, also of variable length, which as
shown in FIGS. 64-66, comprises an outer sleeve element 857 and an inner extendable element 859 that is slidably disposed within outer sleeve element 857 (the inner extendable element 859 having an outside dimension that is slightly less than the inside
dimension of outer sleeve element 857), as well as a mechanism or device (not shown in the drawings) for extending and retracting inner extendable element 859, thus allowing the length of lower pivot arm 852 to vary (in a manner that is well known in the
art), and thereby allowing the position of the leading edge 738 of lower air deflection element 736d to be controlled separately, so as to vary still further the deployed positions of the lower air deflection element, as will be explained hereinafter.
 Although some installations of lower air deflection element 736d may require only a single lower pivot arm 852, with that one lower pivot arm situated (together with the drive components) substantially along the imaginary center line of lower
air deflection element 736d (as shown in FIGS. 62-66), other installations may require, depending upon the width of the vehicle, the enhanced support that would be provided by additional lower pivot arms 852 situated at other locations.  For example, as
shown in phantom lines in FIG. 60, two additional lower pivot arms 852 may be provided, one located inwardly of the left side trailing corner edge 730 of vehicle 714, and the other located inwardly of the right side trailing corner edge of vehicle 714.
 As shown in FIG. 62, each lower pivot arm 852 has a distal end 852a and a proximal end 852b and may be coupled, respectively, by any suitable means, to lower air deflection element 736d (at a point on its inner surface 756 adjacent its leading
edge 738) and to base portion 744 of mounting element 742.  Illustratively, the inner extendable element 859 of each lower pivot arm 852 is pierced adjacent its distal end, while the inner surface 756 of lower air deflection element 736d carries an
associated projection, preferably comprising an angle bracket 863, which is also pierced and which is rotatably coupled to the inner extendable element 859 of lower pivot arm 852 adjacent its distal end in a conventional fashion, via hinge pin 864. 
Lower pivot arm 852 is also illustratively pierced adjacent its proximal end 852b, while the base 744 of mounting element 742 carries an associated projection, preferably comprising an upstanding angle bracket 783, which is also pierced and which is
rotatably coupled to lower pivot arm 852 at its proximal end 852b in a conventional fashion via hinge pin 868.
 FIGS. 64-66 depict the manner in which lower air deflection element 736d may be deployed, as well as some of the deployed positions that it may assume.  Preferably, the drive components allow lower air deflection element 736d to be displaced
between a retracted position and at least one air flow diverting, deployed position, but most preferably they allow the position of lower air deflection element 736d to vary over a continuous range of positions, from a fully retracted position (as shown
in FIGS. 60-62), through a number of air-flow diverting deployed positions (an illustrative two of which are shown in FIG. 64, one in solid lines and one in phantom lines, with an additional illustrative two such positions being shown in FIGS. 65 and
66--an additional position is also shown in phantom lines in FIG. 64, but this position is not air-flow diverting because in this position the lower air deflection element 736d does not intersect the airflow, and it is included merely as an illustration
of an intermediate position as lower air deflection element 736d is being moved between its fully retracted position and one of its deployed positions).
 It is possible, by deploying lower air deflection element 736d as shown in solid lines in FIG. 64, with its leading edge 738 spaced apart from the rear edge of partition segment 746b, to cause most of the airflow originating along the bottom of
the vehicle to be diverted into the area behind the vehicle, by being ""ducted"" or ""scooped"" between lower air deflection element 736d and the vehicle body (as indicated by the arrow JJ in FIG. 64), as well as by being ""bent"" under and around lower air
deflection element 736d, thus utilizing both the inner and outer surface of that lower air deflection element simultaneously, with the contribution of each component of the diversion varying, depending upon the degree to which the lower pivot arm(s) 852
is/are extended; as mentioned hereinbefore, such a position would be appropriate for use when the vehicle is moving at low and moderate speeds.  However, it is also possible, by deploying lower air deflection element 736d as shown in FIG. 65, with its
leading edge 738 abutting the rear edge of partition segment 746b, to cause the airflow originating along the bottom of the vehicle to be diverted into the area behind the vehicle only by being ""bent"" under and around lower air deflection element 736d
(as indicated by the arrows KK in FIG. 65), thus utilizing primarily the outer surface of that lower air deflection element; as mentioned hereinbefore, such a position would be appropriate for use when the vehicle is moving at high speeds.  In addition,
it is possible, by deploying lower air deflection element 736d as shown in FIG. 66 (and, to a lesser extent, as illustrated by the airflow-diverting position shown in phantom lines in FIG. 64), to utilize lower air deflection element 736d to advantage in
tandem vehicular environments, as described in further detail hereinbefore, the diversion of the airflow being indicated by the arrow LL in FIG. 66.
 As will be evident, the alternate structure for a lower air deflection element as just described may be used for the upper, left side and right side air deflection elements as well, and referring now to FIGS. 67-69 in addition to the
aforementioned FIGS. 1-66, such an arrangement constitutes a fourth embodiment of the retractable air defection apparatus of the present invention, which is generally designated by the reference numeral 711, and which will now be described,
illustratively in conjunction with a medium-haul vehicular environment exemplified by a vehicle 714' which is similar to the vehicle 714 as shown in FIGS. 60-69, but which has a roll-up door 724' of smaller dimension, and consequently has a rear-facing
surface 722' that encompasses greater surface area, in that it is wider on either side of that door than is shown for vehicle 714 in FIG. 60 (or for vehicle 312 in FIG. 27), and in that it extends downward further from the upper trailing corner edge of
the cargo compartment than is shown for vehicle 312 in FIG. 27.
 As shown best in FIG. 67, the additional surface area of rear-facing surface 722' allows for the installation and use of an upper air deflection element 736a, as well as a left side air deflection element 736b and a right side air deflection
element 736c, each of which is constructed, and which operates, in the same manner as lower air deflection element 736d described hereinbefore in connection with FIGS. 60-66.  FIGS. 67-69 also show the apparatus 710 as including a lower air deflection
element 736d which is substantially identical to that depicted in FIGS. 60-66.
 It is to be understood that in this fourth embodiment of the invention, each of air deflection elements 736a, 736b and 736c is preferably associated with, and when in the fully retracted position shown in FIGS. 67 and 68 is disposed within, its
own respective mounting frame 742, each of which comprises a flat base portion 744 that is affixed to the lower portion of rear-facing surface 722, as well as an upstanding partition portion 746 disposed at right angles to the base portion 744 and
oriented along the direction of travel of the vehicle, extending rearwards and substantially surrounding the respective air deflection element 736d on four sides, the partition portion 746 in each case comprising four partition segments forming a
substantially continuous, substantially rectangular, protective, frame-like border around each respective air deflection element, as shown best in FIGS. 67 and 68.
 It is also to be understood that in this fourth embodiment of the invention, each of air deflection elements 736a, 736b and 736c is preferably associated with its own respective set of drive components, as well as its own respective at least one
lower pivot arms 852, as shown in phantom lines in FIG. 67, all of which are substantially identical to those described hereinbefore in connection with lower air deflection element 736d and depicted in FIGS. 60-66 (but with the understanding that the
drive components and lower pivot arms for air deflection elements 736a, 736b and 736c will be oriented appropriately so as to enable deployment and retraction of each, FIG. 69 showing the left side air deflection element 736b, the right side air
deflection element 736c and the lower air deflection element 736d all in a deployed position substantially corresponding to the deployed position shown in greater detail in FIG. 65 for lower air deflection element 736d).
 It is further to be understood that in this fourth embodiment of the invention, although not shown in the drawings, each of air deflection elements 736a, 736b and 736c may also be provided with a plurality of light sources, which are positioned
on the respective outer surfaces of those air deflection elements, in an array which preferably reproduces both the number and positions of any of the vehicle's native marker lights (if any) that they may conceal, with such light sources preferably being
illuminated automatically, in the same manner in which the vehicle's native marker lights are normally illuminated.
 In order to eliminate the possibility (when all four air deflection elements are deployed) that the trailing edge of upper air deflection element 736a and the trailing edge of lower air deflection element 736d might interfere with (and even
offer resistance to) the airflow being diverted into the area behind the vehicle from the left by left side air deflection element 736b and/or from the right by right side air deflection element 736c, the left and right ends of upper air deflection
element 736a and lower air deflection element 736d may be appropriately beveled, curved or otherwise contoured.  Similarly, in order to eliminate the possibility that the trailing edge of left side air deflection element 736b and the trailing edge of
right side air deflection element 736c might interfere with (and even offer resistance to) the airflow being diverted into the area behind the vehicle from above by upper air deflection element 736a and/or from below by lower air deflection element 736d,
the upper and lower ends of left side air deflection element 736b and right side air deflection element 736c may also be beveled, curved or otherwise contoured.  For ease of illustration, this beveling (or curving or contouring) is not shown in the
drawings.
 For this fourth embodiment of the present invention, as well as for all of the other embodiments described hereinbefore, it will be understood that the air deflection elements, once deployed, will remain in that configuration until retracted by
the operator of the vehicle.  However, it is possible that, due to oversight, the operator of the vehicle may leave the air deflection elements in a deployed position when the vehicle comes to a halt or is being parked for the night, or even more
problematically, when the vehicle is being maneuvered, usually in reverse gear, into a conventional loading dock or other area dedicated to the loading or unloading of cargo.  The air deflection elements, if left in a deployed condition, may impede the
driver's ability to monitor road conditions behind the vehicle in order to maneuver the vehicle in reverse gear and/or, even worse, may themselves be crushed or otherwise physically damaged or destroyed, due to inadvertent collision with the loading dock
itself or with other nearby walls and/or objects.
 In order to remedy this situation, the air deflection apparatus of the present invention preferably further comprises either a warning device, which would help to avoid damage to the air deflection elements by alerting the vehicle operator of
the deployed condition when the operator seeks to implement reverse-gear operation of the vehicle, or a reverse-gear interlock, which would prevent damage to the air deflection elements by actually prohibiting reverse-gear operation of the vehicle unless
and until the air deflection elements are first fully retracted.
 Thus, for each of the embodiments of the invention described hereinbefore that utilize drive components with which the air deflection elements may be deployed and retracted (and caused to assume differing positions of deployment) through manual
manipulation, the apparatus further comprises at least one sensor associated with each of the air deflection elements, preferably in the form of a contact/proximity switch of a type (typically magnetic) which is well known in the art, positioned such
that its output will signal whether the air deflection elements are fully retracted.  The output of this sensor can be wired to a device located in the passenger compartment that will provide a visual and/or audible indication of the deployed condition
when reverse gear is engaged; such devices are also well known in the art, and would be similar to the back-up alarms with which most cargo vehicles are presently equipped (and which are required in most jurisdictions for safety reasons), that provide an
audible warning outside the vehicle that reverse gear has been engaged, but in this case would provide a ""deployed"" warning within the passenger compartment of the vehicle, and would thus encourage the vehicle operator at least to consider whether the
air deflection element(s) should be manually retracted before continuing to operate the vehicle in reverse gear.
 More preferably, however, as a alternative to such a audible/visible warning device, the operation of the vehicle in reverse gear while the air deflection element(s) is/are still deployed can be completely prevented (i.e., blocked) by instead
wiring the output of the sensor(s) so as to activate a powered relay (such as a solenoid) that would disallow reverse gear operation; such transmission ""interlock"" systems are well known in the art, and would be similar to the ""power take off"" interlocks
with which tow trucks are typically equipped and which prevent engagement of the transmission (in any gear) while an auxiliary device (such as a power winch) is in operation, but in this case would only prevent engagement of the transmission in reverse
gear until the air deflection element(s) is/are fully retracted.
 The same audible/visible ""deployed"" warning and/or reverse gear interlock can also be implemented with those embodiments of the invention described hereinbefore that utilize power-assisted drive components; those embodiments optionally (but
preferably) already include sensors, as described hereinbefore, that provide a remote indication in the cab of the current positions of each of the air deflection elements, and it is within the skill of the art to provide the warning device and/or
interlock apparatus, and to direct the output of those sensors such that they can also energize the warning device and/or engage the interlock as indicated above.  For those embodiments that do not already include such sensors, it is also within the
skill of the art to add contact/proximity-type sensors to the apparatus, in the same manner as they would be added, as described above, to the embodiments utilizing manually-manipulated drive components.
 Since there may be rare instances in which operation of the vehicle in reverse gear, despite deployment of the air deflection elements, may be desired on a temporary or intermittent basis, the air deflection apparatus may further include a
switch, preferably located in the passenger compartment of the vehicle, with which the audible/visible warning, and/or the reverse gear interlock, may be overridden.  Most preferably, a visible display, indicating that the override switch had been
engaged, would accompany, and would be activated by, any such an override switch.
 Turning now to another optional (but preferred) feature of the invention, for each of the embodiments described hereinbefore that utilize power-assisted drive components with which the air deflection elements may be deployed and retracted (and
caused to assume differing positions of deployment), the apparatus preferably further comprises an automatic, microprocessor-based control system (not shown in the drawings) for automatic variable ""fine-tuning"" of the deployment and retraction of the air
deflection elements, in order to optimize more precisely the aerodynamic drag reduction that those air deflection elements can provide, thereby maximizing fuel economy for the vehicle.  This automatic control system, as a further option, can either
remain permanently engaged, or can be provided such that manual engagement or disengagement at will, under driver control, is possible.  Although the microprocessor used for automatic control is preferably incorporated within or forms a part of the
control unit for the power-assisted drive components with which the air deflection elements may be deployed and retracted, it should be understood that any appropriate data processing element may be used, including a data processing element situated in a
lap-based computational device connected to the drive components and operated either by the driver of the vehicle or otherwise from the passenger compartment, or even by a data processing element situated in a computational device that is remote from the
vehicle, provided that the remote computational device is connected with the drive components through an appropriate communications device and uses an appropriate communications protocol.
 The automatic control system preferably comprises a microprocessor under stored program control, an associated memory for storage of the program and other data, and at least one additional sensor which monitors transient variables that affect
the airflow dynamics of the vehicle, such as ambient wind speed and direction, ambient temperature and other weather conditions such as barometric pressure, the output of which is continuously fed to the microprocessor.  The microprocessor also
continuously receives information as to the current speed of the vehicle and its fuel consumption, which can be provided by a truck data readout device; such devices are well known in the art, and can be added to the vehicle on an after-market basis if
not included as original equipment when the vehicle is newly-manufactured.  In addition, the microprocessor receives data from the position sensor(s) as to the current position(s) of each of the air deflection elements.
 The optimum positioning of the air deflection elements, in terms of both the clearance of the leading and trailing edges (from the vehicle body) and the angle at which the air deflection element is disposed (relative to the vehicle body), will
also vary according to the weight of the load being carried by the vehicle, which can remain constant for long periods of time, on the order of days or even weeks, particularly for long-haul vehicular environments such as those described hereinbefore, as
well as according to the aerodynamic properties of the vehicle itself, that is, with variations in the shape and size of the vehicle body, which will differ from one class of vehicle to another, and which may differ from one vehicle to another within the
same class, even among those of the same make and model, but which will remain constant for each particular vehicle, if not for its entire useful life then certainly for very long periods of time, most likely on the order of many years.
 Thus, the memory associated with the microprocessor preferably will contain pre-determined data representing the optimal positions for the air deflection elements for the aerodynamic characteristics of that particular vehicle, most preferably
combined separately with a variety of representative load weights so as to yield a set of pre-determined ""profiles"" for that vehicle when traveling with different loads, such that the profile that most closely approximates the actual weight may be
pre-selected prior to the commencement of a trip (and once the actual weight of the load is known), although it may also be possible to avoid such approximations by allowing for input to the microprocessor (e.g., through a keyboard or keypad), prior to
the commencement of a trip, of the exact loaded vehicle weight (once known), to be combined instantaneously by the microprocessor with the pre-loaded data representing the optimal positions for the air deflection elements for the aerodynamic
characteristics of that particular vehicle, so as to calculate a ""profile"" for that particular load, which may then be utilized and at the same time stored, either permanently for future use on other trips, or only for the duration of that particular
trip (or at least until the weight of the load changes).
 Optionally, multiple profiles could also be pre-stored for each representative load weight, with each such profile containing pre-determined data representing the optimal positions for the air deflection elements for that load and for a given
representative set of weather/driving conditions.  It may even be possible to pre-store a set of profiles for each combination of representative load and weather/driving conditions, with each of the profiles in the set being calibrated for a different
driving speed.
 In order to create such a profile, the microprocessor could be programmed first to determine, for a given, relatively constant velocity, the average fuel consumption value for the ""current"" position of the air deflection elements, and then to
extend (or retract) the upper air deflection element in small increments, determining the average fuel consumption value for each such position.  The position of the upper air deflection element that results in the lowest fuel consumption would then be
utilized and stored, and the process would then be repeated for the side air deflection elements (most preferably moving them together, in unison), with their positions that results in the lowest fuel consumption also being utilized and stored. 
Thereafter, the position of the upper air deflection element would once again be varied, and the position thereof resulting in the lowest fuel consumption determined and once again stored.  These optimal positions for the air deflection elements would
then be stored permanently in a profile, along with the speed, weather/driving conditions, and load data, and the same calibration steps could be performed for other driving speeds, yielding a separate profile, for example, for every driving speed
between ten miles per hour and seventy miles per hour, taken at ten mile-per-hour intervals.
 In operation, upon selection of a particular profile the microprocessor would be programmed to deliver output representing positioning data for the air deflection elements that would be sent to the control unit (not shown in the drawings) so as
to automatically cause the air deflection elements to be positioned accordingly.  Thereafter, the microprocessor would be programmed to receive and process continuously the data representing the speed of the vehicle and/or the weather/driving conditions,
and would automatically utilize different profiles, as needed, based on any changes in such conditions.
 In addition, since it might not be possible to provide and store a separate profile representing every possible speed for every given set of weather/driving conditions and load, the microprocessor would preferably also be programmed, once a
particular profile were selected, to receive and process continuously the data representing the speed and fuel consumption of the vehicle, and even while utilizing that specific profile, would periodically deliver (at predetermined intervals) output
representing positioning data that would be sent to the control unit so as to automatically cause the positions of the air deflection elements to change, on a dynamic basis, i.e., as needed during travel and as the speed changes, thus ""fine-tuning"" the
positions of the air deflection elements to the particular speed and driving behavior (it is to be understood, however, that the microprocessor can be programmed to carry out this same ""fine-tuning"" even if no particular profile has been selected
initially, prior to the commencement of a trip, and/or no profiles are available or have been stored in the associated memory, and/or the air deflection elements have been deployed and/or retracted using the actuator switch(es) rather than under
microprocessor control).
 As mentioned previously in connection with tandem vehicular environments, during a relatively sharp turn the risk of contact between one of the side air deflection elements mounted on a leading container unit and the front surface of a trailing
container unit can be eliminated by allowing for a slight additional or further extension and then a slight contraction or shortening of the rear pivot arms (of only one side air deflection element or the other), in a dynamic fashion as the vehicle
turns, and only for the duration of the turn, so as to briefly force further outwards the trailing edge of the air deflection element that is on the ""inside"" of the turn.  Although such position adjustments can be accomplished from the cab of the vehicle
remotely by the driver (or other occupant of the cab), using the position readout devices and actuator switch(es) mentioned hereinbefore, it would be preferable, as previously stated, for such adjustments to be accomplished automatically, without the
need for driver intervention.
 Therefore, preferably, additional sensors are provided with which vehicle turns (either to the right or the left) can be monitored, the output of which is fed continuously to the aforementioned microprocessor, and the latter can be programmed to
receive and process continuously the data representing the extent of each vehicle turn, and to deliver output representing positioning data that would be sent to the control unit so as to automatically cause the positions of the air deflection elements
to change appropriately, in a dynamic fashion, first as the vehicle enters each right- or left-hand turn, and again thereafter as the vehicle exits each such turn.
 It should be understood that since those embodiments of the invention described hereinbefore that utilize power-assisted drive components with which the air deflection elements may be deployed and retracted (and caused to assume differing
positions of deployment) augmented with a microprocessor-based automatic control system, already include sensors, as described hereinbefore, which provide indications of the current positions of each of the air deflection elements, it is within the skill
of the art to provide the warning device and/or the interlock apparatus described above, and to direct the output of those sensors such that they can also energize the warning device and/or engage the interlock as indicated above, although it may
alternatively be possible to program the microprocessor, upon engagement of reverse gear by the vehicle operator and receipt of output from the sensors indicating a deployed condition, to cause the air deflection element(s) to be moved to the fully
retracted position(s) automatically, after which the microprocessor would cause the warning device to be silenced and/or cause the interlock device to be disengaged, thus allowing the vehicle then to be operated in reverse gear.
 Referring finally to FIGS. 70 and 71 in addition to the aforementioned FIGS. 1-68, it may be possible to utilize, in the same vehicular environment, a mixture of different air deflection elements from the various embodiments of the invention
described above (rather than always utilizing a ""matched set"" of air deflection elements, as depicted in a number of the drawings).  In addition, and as mentioned previously, the air deflection apparatus of the present invention may also be utilized in
vehicular environments in which there is no rear-facing door, although it is to be understood that the use of a non-matching assortment of air deflection elements is not necessarily linked to such a vehicular environment.  In other words, it is within
the scope of the invention to utilize a ""matched set"" of air deflection elements in vehicular environments having no rear-facing door, and it is also within the scope of the invention to utilize a non-matching assortment of air deflection elements in
vehicular environments having one or more rear-facing doors.
 FIGS. 70 and 71 depict vehicular environments in which there is no rear-facing door, with FIG. 70 illustrating a typical ""motor coach"" or ""tour"" bus vehicle 812, and FIG. 71 depicting a typical ""camper"" or motor home vehicle 912, although it is
to be understood that there are other vehicular environments in which there is no rear-facing door, such as freight-carrying rail boxcars, in which the present invention may also be utilized.  Both bus 812 and motor home 912 are illustrated as carrying a
non-matching assortment of air deflection elements 836, 936, that is, both vehicles have side air deflection elements 836b, 836c, 936b, 936c constructed in accordance with the first embodiment of the invention as described hereinabove, but both vehicles
also have upper air deflection elements 836a, 936a constructed in accordance with the third embodiment of the invention as described hereinabove, as well as a lower air deflection elements 836d, 936d constructed in accordance with the fourth embodiment
of the invention as described hereinabove.
 All of the air deflection elements in each non-matching assortment that is illustrated in FIGS. 70 and 71 are shown in those drawings only in their fully retracted positions, although it is to be understood that each of these air deflection
elements will be capable of deployment, as described in detail hereinabove for the air deflection elements of each respective embodiment.  Thus, it should be understood that when non-matching assortments of air deflection elements are utilized, the
apparatus of the invention preferably further comprises drive components (as described hereinabove) with which the air deflection elements may be deployed and retracted, and caused to assume differing positions of deployment, and that the drive
components may be operated either manually or with powered assistance, and in the latter case, may be hydraulically, pneumatically or electro-mechanically driven, and may even be remotely controlled, e.g., by the driver, from the interior of the vehicle.
 Although non-matching assortments of air deflection elements are within the scope of the invention, it is to be understood that when such non-matching assortments are utilized, it is still preferred that the left- and right-side air deflection
elements be similar to one another in construction and, more preferably, that they form a matching (that is, symmetrical) pair.  Accordingly, it is to be understood that for the bus 812 in FIG. 70, the right-side air deflection element 836c (which is
barely visible in the drawing) matches the construction of left-side air deflection element 836b, and similarly, that for the motor home 912 in FIG. 71, the left-side air deflection element 936b (which is barely visible in the drawing) matches the
construction of right-side air deflection element 936c.
 As shown in FIGS. 70 and 71, it is to be understood that this additional embodiment of the invention also preferably includes, for each air deflection element 836, 936, a plurality of light sources similar to those depicted in connection with
the earlier embodiments of the invention described hereinbefore.  Specifically, for each upper air deflection element 836a, 936a, respective light sources 802, 902 are preferably positioned adjacent the trailing edge in an array which preferably
reproduces both the number and positions of the vehicle's native marker lights (aligned transversely across the upper portion of rear-facing surface of the vehicle), and which may be illuminated, either automatically or manually by the driver of the
vehicle, in the same manner in which the vehicle's native marker lights are normally illuminated.
 Similarly, each side deflection element 836b, 936c preferably carries light sources 803, 804 and 805 (in FIG. 70) and light sources 903, 904 and 905 (in FIG. 71), which duplicate the function as well as the number and positions (and most
preferably, even the color) of certain other native taillights of the vehicle.  For example, as shown in FIGS. 70 and 71, light sources 803, 903 could duplicate the function of the vehicle's native, usually white, back-up/reverse indicator lights, while
light sources 804, 904 could duplicate the function of the vehicle's native, usually amber, turn signal indicators (and optionally could, as shown in FIGS. 70 and 71, be fashioned in the shape of an arrow), and light sources 805, 905 could duplicate the
function of the vehicle's native, usually red, side brake indicator lights.  It is to be understood that the vehicle's native taillights may be positioned along the side portions of the rear-facing surface of the vehicle, perhaps in vertical alignment as
indicated in FIG. 71, although as illustrated in FIG. 70, not necessarily always aligned vertically.  It is also to be understood that other models of buses and motor homes might have other running lights or indicator lights (not shown in the drawings)
which might be covered by one or more of the air deflection elements when they are deployed, and in those cases the air deflection elements could carry other corresponding light sources as well.
 As an alternative to light sources which duplicate the function of the vehicle's native taillights (both marker lights and indicator lights), it is also within the scope of the invention to manufacture the air deflection elements with
transparent ""inserts"" that would function as ""windows"" and would allow the vehicle's native taillights to be visible through the air deflection elements even when they are deployed.  It is to be understood that this alternative may similarly be utilized
in connection with each of the other embodiments of the invention as described hereinbefore.
 As illustrated in FIG. 71, the rear-facing surface of motor home 912 includes a utility ladder 950, which allows access to the roof of the vehicle for various purposes (such as, for example, to access an additional storage location); such a
utility ladder is a common feature of many models of motor homes that are in use today.  However, there is a possibility that such a utility ladder would interfere with the operation of the upper air deflection element 936a.  Specifically, when the
elongating member of the upper air deflection element 936a is deployed and extends from its housing (not shown in the drawing), that elongating member may come into contact with the side rails 951 of utility ladder 950.  In such a case, it is to be
understood that the elongating member will be manufactured so as to have slot-like openings (apertures or slits) (not visible in the drawing) that are cut into the elongating member at the appropriate locations, each opening accommodating one of the side
rails 951 of utility ladder 950, as necessary, when the elongating member is in a deployed position.
 While there has been described what are at present considered to be the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the embodiments described herein are by way of illustration and not of
limitation, and that various changes and modifications may be made therein.  For example, there are many vehicles having cargo compartments that are not truly box-shaped, i.e., the sides and/or the top and bottom of the vehicle, including the
corresponding edges, are not linear (an extreme example being a typical ""tanker"" truck, which is conventionally used for hauling gasoline, heating oil, propane and other liquid or gaseous substances, and which has a cargo compartment that is oval or
ellipsoidal in vertical cross-section), yet such vehicles are subject to the same aerodynamic drag factors that plague box-shaped vehicles as described hereinbefore (albeit perhaps to a lesser degree).  The air deflection elements of the present
invention can be modified for use on such vehicles, by conforming the long axis of each air deflection element to the profile of that portion of the vehicle surface or edge to which it is coupled, thereby affording to such vehicles at least some of the
aerodynamic drag reduction capabilities that this invention can provide.  These and other changes and modifications may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the present invention, as set forth in the appended claims.

 This disclosure relates to automotive vehicles, and more particularly is directed to maximizing aerodynamics and/or cooling performance associated with automotive vehicles.
 There is always a need to improve the aerodynamics associated with an automotive vehicle, not just from an aesthetic standpoint, but also to improve drag and fuel economy.  Likewise, improved aerodynamics typically limits the number or size of
openings into the vehicle to reduce the drag, and this in turn leads to less air being provided for cooling performance.  For example, less air is made available to the engine compartment and therefore there is a need to improve the efficient handling of
air entering into the automotive vehicle.
 One example of a prior arrangement uses an air dam bolted to a bulkhead of the vehicle.  The air dam directs the air to pass through a bottom region of the radiator and oftentimes as a dead zone is created because of the flow path of the air. 
Further, the air dam extends downwardly from the vehicle and is potentially exposed to possible structural damage if inadvertent forces are imposed on the air dam.  By way of example only, contact with a curb or a steep angled portion of a driveway can
result in undesired forces on the air dam.  The fastener connection is intended to break or shear before any damage could result to the remainder the automotive vehicle, but nonetheless the air dam or connection of the air dam with the automotive vehicle
is potentially exposed to damage.
 Generally, the air dam is a vertically extending wall extending downwardly from the vehicle that air impinges on and is thereby directed upwardly into a bottom opening that communicates with the engine compartment and lower portion of the
radiator.  Although the air is directed and pulled from under the vehicle, a dead spot (i.e., region of reduced velocity airflow) develops in the engine compartment adjacent the bottom of the radiator as the air turns from a vertical direction from under
the vehicle to a more horizontal direction through the radiator/condenser.  The problem can result in extremely low air flow velocities thus rendering the lower portion of the radiator ineffective.
 It is also recognized that different vehicle speeds will result in different air flow velocities through the vehicle.  Thus, one orientation or of the air dam is not ideal for all situations.  For example, one orientation may be desired to
maximize the amount of air entering the engine compartment at a first vehicle speed while another orientation may be desired to streamline the airflow through the engine compartment at a second vehicle speed.  However, existing air dam designs do not
effectively address both situations.
 Therefore, a need exists to increase the efficiency of cooling air entering the vehicle, and simultaneously improve the aerodynamic and drag impact.
SUMMARY
 An apparatus for improving airflow through an engine compartment from a bottom opening of an automotive vehicle includes an air dam mounted in the engine compartment and extending generally vertically below a radiator.  The air dam includes an
integral spring-like portion for absorbing impact forces imposed on the air dam.
 The apparatus for improving efficiency of cooling airflow entering an automotive vehicle includes an elongated air dam extending downwardly from beneath a radiator.  The air dam has a mounting region cantilever-mounted adjacent the radiator and
has a terminal end region that is horizontally offset therefrom.
 A method of improving efficiency of cooling air flow entering automotive vehicle includes a step of providing an air dam that directs airflow toward a radiator and including a spring-like region in the air dam for absorbing impact forces imposed
thereon. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 FIG. 1 illustrates a portion of a conventional automotive vehicle 100, particularly a front end 102 of the automotive vehicle.  More specifically, an engine compartment 104 is shown with a number of vehicle components removed for ease of
reference and understanding.  A front fascia 106 of the vehicle may include a grille 108 and a lower fascia 110.  In the illustrated embodiment, the grille 108 includes at least one opening 112 through which airflow may enter the engine compartment 104
along a first path for cooling the engine compartment and associated engine (not shown).  At least a portion of this first path of the airflow preferably impinges on a condenser 120 and/or radiator 122.  Further, a second or bottom opening 130 is
preferably provided on the underside of the automotive vehicle and also communicates with the engine compartment 104.
 Also illustrated in FIG. 1 is an air dam 140 that is mounted to the vehicle frame and preferably extends downwardly from mounting relation with a bulkhead 142.  As shown, in this prior art arrangement, the air dam 140 is a generally simple
structure mounted along an upper edge to the bulkhead 142 and preferably rearwardly of the bottom opening 130.  The air dam 140 deflects air into the bottom opening 130 of the vehicle in a generally vertical direction where the air then moves rearwardly
along a second airflow path that proceeds along a lower region of the engine compartment toward lower regions of the condenser 120 and/or radiator 122.
 A first preferred embodiment of a modified air dam 240 of the present disclosure is shown in FIG. 2.  Like FIG. 1, the air dam 240 of this embodiment is also secured along one edge, preferably along an upper edge 244, with the vehicle bulkhead
242.  Specifically, one or more fasteners or mounting bolts 246 preferably extend through the upper portion 244 for securing the air dam to the vehicle frame.  Alternative manners of securing the air dam can also be used without departing from the scope
and intent of the present disclosure.  The air dam extends downwardly and substantially in the same location as that shown in the arrangement of FIG. 1, i.e., disposed rearwardly of a bottom opening that communicates with the engine compartment.  In this
preferred embodiment, the air dam is modified to include an integral spring-like portion 250 incorporated into the structure of the air dam for absorbing impact forces that are imposed on the air dam.  In the preferred arrangement, the spring-like
portion is included in the upper portion of the air dam, shown here as adjacent and below the fasteners 246.  One form of the spring-like portion 250 is a generally corrugate-shaped portion that is adapted to flex or deform like a bellows or in response
to forces imposed on the air dam.  Typically forces are generated as a result of a lower, terminal end portion 252 shown here as having a generally planar conformation and extending from the spring-like corrugation 250.  The lower portion 252 depends
downwardly from the underside of the vehicle (see FIG. 1) so that terminal end 254 occasionally engages a driveway, bumper block, curb, etc. since the air dam is formed from a generally rigid material, such as a stiff plastic.  The forces are conveyed
through the air dam and lead to potential damage to the air dam, or breakage or fracturing of the fastener mounting of the air dam with the vehicle frame.  In order to minimize potential damage, the spring-like, corrugate portion 250 flexes and absorbs
the impact of these forces.
 It is also evident in FIG. 2 that lower, terminal end 254 is preferably horizontally offset from the upper portion 244, particularly where the upper portion is secured to the vehicle frame.  This offset is represented by reference 262 and
indicates a generally horizontal dimension.  Of course one skilled in the art will appreciate that this horizontal dimension is representative only and different dimensions may be used and tuned to specific vehicle airflows.
 Further, reference numeral 262 represents an angular orientation of the lower portion 252 of the air dam 240.  Shown here, the angle 262 may be on the order of a few degrees from vertical so that the terminal end 254 is angled downwardly and
toward the forward end of the vehicle i.e. toward the bottom opening that communicates with the engine compartment and toward the front end of the vehicle.  The illustration in FIG. 2 is also representative of the unloaded (no or low airflow)
conformation of the air dam.  Once vehicle speed increases, the airflow pressure will exert a deflecting force on the surface of the lower portion 252 of the air dam as a result of the cantilever-type mounting provided at the upper end 244 of the air
dam.  In other words, the lower portion 252 will generally rotate rearwardly (in a generally counter-clockwise direction as illustrated) about the fastened upper end 244.  Thus, at elevated vehicle speeds, sufficient force is generated to move the lower
portion 252 toward a vertical orientation (toward offset plane 260).  Of course the noted range of speeds should not be deemed limiting but rather is exemplary only.
 FIG. 3 is a representation of the prior art mounting region of a conventional air dam to the vehicle frame or bulkhead.  As is evident, fastener 146 extends outwardly from the end of a generally planar conformation of the prior art air dam 140
from the mounting region of the air dam with the bulkhead 142.  Arrow 370 is representative of the airflow path adjacent the forward facing surface of the air dam as the air proceeds from the bottom opening 130 toward the condenser/radiator.  The
fastener 146 extends outwardly from this front face of the air dam and due to its protrusion, adds turbulence and interrupts the desired smoothly contoured airflow path along the air dam prior to being directed toward the condenser and radiator.
 In FIGS. 4 and 5, a rounded region 480 is preferably provided in the air dam 440 to direct airflow along arrow 482 between the upper and lower portions 444, 454, respectively, of the air dam and to prevent turbulence as the air passes the
fastener 446.  The rounded region 480 serves the dual purpose of providing an offset (similar to offset 260 in FIG. 2 (which also incorporates a rounded region in the air dam) as well as allowing the air to make a sharper bend into the radiator.  This
makes the lower section of the radiator more effective since the dead spot that is experienced with the turbulent airflow in FIG. 3 is avoided by the more smoothly contoured airflow 482 of FIG. 4.  A more efficient airflow provides for potential increase
on the order of a 2% increase in efficiency for flow into the lower portion of the radiator when compared with prior arrangements.
 FIG. 6 shows a slight modification to the air dam 440 (which includes upper and lower portions 444, 454) of FIG. 5.  Particularly, the air dam is curved side-to-side.  This curved conformation 452 is desirable for reducing drag and improving
aerodynamic airflow around the air dam.  Of course one skilled in the art will recognize that this feature can be incorporated into any of the described embodiments of the present disclosure, and is not limited only to the arrangement of FIG. 6.
 Yet another embodiment is shown in FIG. 7.  In this arrangement, selected functions of the air dam assembly are segregated into separate components of the air dam assembly.  Reference numerals in the ""500"" series will be used to refer to like
elements for ease of understanding.  For example, the bulkhead is now referenced as item 542 and receives the air dam 540 shown here as a two-part, assembled structure, generally referenced as components 590, 592.  The first component 590 is secured by
fastener or mounting bolt 546 to the bulkhead 542.  The first component 590 includes the integrated spring-like portion 550 that again has a generally corrugate-shape and that is adapted to flex in response to forces imposed on the first component 590 of
the air dam.  The terminal end 554 of the elongated first component 590 of the air dam is that portion most likely to inadvertently contact a driveway, bumper block, curb, etc. Thus, the corrugate-shaped, spring-like portion 550 is intended to deform
when such forces are encountered and thereby limit the potential of fracturing the air dam assembly.
 A second component 592 of the assembly is also mounted via fastener 546 to the bulkhead 542.  The second component has a rounded region 580 that directs airflow around the upper portion of the air dam, namely around the spring-like portion 550
of the first component and is also laterally offset relative to the mounting region in order to direct the airflow around the fastening bolt 546.  The second component has a terminal end 594 and a configuration that generally merges into the elongated,
generally vertical portion of the first component.  This still permits a streamlined airflow path from the opening and the bottom of the vehicle, along the air dam, and into the lower portion of the condenser/radiator of the vehicle.  By separating the
rounded region 580 of the second component into a component separate and apart from the first component 590, if any damage occurs to the first component, it is less likely to impact the structural and functional integrity of the second component 592.  In
this way, it is less probable that all of the advantages of the two-part air dam assembly would be adversely effected.
 FIGS. 8-10 illustrate yet another embodiment of a preferred air dam arrangement.  Air dam 640 includes an inverted, generally U-shaped bend 650 at its uppermost end that serves a similar function to the corrugate-like spring in the prior
embodiments.  Again, a fastener such as bolt 646 secures the air dam to the vehicle frame or bulkhead 642.  The U-shaped bend 650 substantially encompasses or encloses the head of the fastener 646 so that openings 694 are provided at desired locations
(shown in transversely spaced locations in FIG. 8) to allow access by an associated tool (not shown) for removing or securing the air dam to the bulkhead.  The precise number of access openings is intended to match the number of fasteners, although the
total number of fasteners may vary.  Likewise, the particular configuration of the openings may vary although circular openings are simple and prevent stress concentrations.  This configuration of the U-shaped bend 650 disposed at the uppermost end of
the air dam is desirable since it facilitates airflow around the bulkhead, fastener head, etc. and transitions the airflow path from a generally vertical airflow to a more horizontal airflow through the condenser/radiator.  Thus, air directed by the air
dam through the bottom breather opening of the vehicle is advantageously directed to a lower portion of the condenser 620/radiator 622.
 The lower portion 652 of the air dam preferably has a generally planar conformation and a terminal end 654 that extends outwardly from an underside of the vehicle at a position located rearwardly of the bottom breather opening.  As in prior
embodiments, the generally planar portion 652 of the air dam may be angularly disposed and adapted for rearward deflection as vehicle speed increases.
 Further, a transverse rib 696 extends across the generally planar portion to define a secondary or auxiliary bending region.  As shown in FIGS. 8-10, the rib 696 extends across the entire transverse width of the air dam and at a location
approximately mid-height between the U-shaped bend 650 and the terminal end 654.  The rib 696 acts as a second bending region that can provide auxiliary bending after the generally U-shaped bend 650 has bottomed out against the bulkhead.  If desired, the
rib may be thinner than a thickness of the remainder of the air dam to facilitate bending, however it need not necessarily be thinner to still effectively function as a secondary bending region.
 The efficiency of cooling air flow entering an automotive vehicle is improved by providing at least portions, if not all aspects, of the above described air dam embodiments.  Airflows directed toward the bottom portion the radiator.  Likewise,
the method includes including a spring-like region in the air dam to absorb impact forces imposed on the air dam.  Preferably, angling the air dam toward front of the vehicle from beneath the radiator will improve airflow, and the air dam can deflect
toward a substantially vertical position in response to increased force resulting from increased vehicle speed.  Contouring an upper portion of the air dam, preferably into a rounded surface provides for a desired offset and also directs airflow into the
lower portion of the radiator.
 These preferred embodiments provide for improved cooling performance as a result of optimizing the effectiveness of air entering the vehicle.  Efficiency of the air dam is optimizing improved in a bottom breather application as shown and
described above.  More air can pass through the bottom of the radiator which is usually a dead zone as a result of using the rounded air dam to allow air to ""bend"" easier.  Incorporating the spring-type device into an upper portion of the air dam limits
or prevents structural damage to the air dam as a result of engaging a curb, or similar structure.  As be appreciated, structural damage to the air dam has a negative impact on the cooling performance so that it is desirable to avoid deformation or
breakage.  Mounting the air dam at a slight negative angle allows the air dam to bend or grow back toward vertical at higher speeds vehicle.  The improved airflow through the vehicle increases the efficiency of all air entering the vehicle by
approximately 2% while having no impact on styling or aerodynamic features.
 The disclosure has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments.  Modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding this specification.  The present disclosure is intended to include all such
modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.

 The present invention relates to a vehicle undercover provided on a lower part of a front body of a vehicle.
BACKGROUND ART
 An undercover is provided on a lower part of a front body of a vehicle, that is to say, below an engine room.  Therefore, air, which flows under the vehicle, flows along the undercover when the vehicle travels, thereby improving aerodynamic
performance.
 However, it is required to perform maintenance on various devices such as an engine arranged in the engine room of the vehicle from below.  For example, in replacement of engine oil and replacement of an oil filter, an operator performs various
pieces of operation on the engine in a state in which the vehicle is lifted up.
 Therefore, a plurality of working openings are provided on a conventional undercover on positions corresponding to various pieces of maintenance operation, and such openings are closed by a cover when not being used.  Each patent document
discloses such a vehicle undercover.  The undercover of the vehicle disclosed in patent document 1 is such that the opening is provided on a part thereof and a cap to close the opening so as to be freely opened is integrally formed by providing a thin
portion for a hinge on one side of the opening.  A sound isolation undercover of a vehicle of patent document 2 is such that an access hole is provided and a lid to block the access hole is attached by a screw and a nut.  A front end structure of a
vehicle of patent document 3 is such that a discharge opening is provided behind a radiator on an undercover and a guide flap is provided.

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION
Problem to be Solved by the Invention
 In the above-described conventional vehicle undercover, the opening is provided on a part of a cover main body and the lid is provided for the opening so as to be freely opened and closed.  Therefore, it is conventionally required to provide a
plurality of openings according to the various pieces of maintenance operation for one undercover.  In this case, the undercover is formed of a resin and the lid is integrally formed by an integral hinge.  However, since the undercover and the lid are
formed of the resin, rigidity is not sufficient and a slit-like gap is formed between the lid and the opening when the lid closes the opening.  Then, relative wind enters the gap and air resistance increases, so that the aerodynamic performance is
deteriorated.  In this case, when a plate thickness is increased so as to improve the rigidity of the undercover and the lid, not only a manufacturing cost increases but also a vehicle weight increases.  Also, when the lid is fixed to the cover main body
by a screw without the gap therebetween, operation to remove the lid in order to open the opening at the time of the maintenance operation becomes complicated and maintenance performance is deteriorated.

 In the vehicle undercover according to the present invention, the fixed section closes a part of the lower opening, and the rotating section closes a remaining part of the lower opening, which is not closed by the fixed section.
 In the vehicle undercover according to the present invention, the vehicle undercover is formed of a synthetic resin and the fixed section and the rotating section are rotatably coupled to each other by an integral hinge along a vehicle width
direction.
 In the vehicle undercover according to the present invention, the fixed section is fixed to the front body by a bolt and the rotating section is detachably attached to the front body by a clip.

BEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION
 An embodiment of a vehicle undercover according to the present invention is hereinafter described in detail with reference to the drawings.  Meanwhile, the present invention is not limited by the embodiment.
Embodiment
 FIG. 1 is a plane view of the vehicle undercover according to one embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view taken along line II-II in FIG. 1 illustrating a cross section of the vehicle undercover of this embodiment,
FIG. 3 is a side view of a front portion of a vehicle on which the vehicle undercover of this embodiment is mounted and FIG. 4 is a side view of the front portion of the vehicle in a state in which a working opening is opened.
 In this embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 3, a lower opening 13 is formed on a lower part of a front body 12 of a vehicle 11, and a vehicle undercover 10 of this embodiment is mounted so as to block the lower opening 13.  The vehicle undercover
10 is provided with a fixed section 21 fixed to the front body 12 and a rotating section 22, one end of which is rotatably coupled to the fixed section 21 and the other end of which vertically moves relative to the front body 12 so as to be able to open
and close the lower opening 13.
 That is to say, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the lower opening 13 is formed on the front body 12 of the vehicle 11 so as to correspond to an almost entire area of an engine room.  The vehicle undercover 10 mounted so as to block the lower
opening 13 from below the vehicle 11 has an area slightly larger than that of the lower opening 13 and is arranged such that an outer periphery thereof is overlapped with an edge of the lower opening 13 (front body 12).
 In the vehicle undercover 10, the rotating section 22 is coupled to the fixed section 21 by an integral hinge 23.  That is to say, the vehicle undercover 10 is obtained by integrally forming the fixed section 21, the rotating section 22 and the
integral hinge 23 of a synthetic resin.  The integral hinge 23 is composed of a concave portion along a direction of a rotation axis between the fixed section 21 and the rotating section 22.  The fixed section 21 closes a part of the lower opening 13 and
the rotating section 22 closes a remaining part of the lower opening 13, which is not closed by the fixed section 21.
 The fixed section 21 is arranged on a side of a front end (upper end in FIG. 1) of the lower opening 13 of the front body 12.  A front edge and a side edge of the fixed section 21 are overlapped with the outer edge of the lower opening 13 of the
front body 12 from below and a plurality of bolts 24 pass through the both of them from below, each nut 25 is screwed to each bolt 24 from above, thereby fastening the fixed section 21 to the front body 12.
 The rotating section 22 is arranged on a side of a rear end (lower end in FIG. 1) of the lower opening 13 of the front body 12.  A rear edge and a side edge of the rotating section 22 are overlapped with the outer edge of the lower opening 13 of
the front body 12 from below and a plurality of clips 26 pass through the both of them from below to engage them with each other, thereby detachably attaching the rotating section 22 to the front body 12.  In this case, the rotating section 22 is such
that a front end (one end) thereof is rotatably coupled to a rear end of the fixed section 21 by the integral hinge 23.  On the other hand, a rear end (the other end) thereof vertically moves relative to the front body 12 so as to be able to open and
close the lower opening 13.
 The rotating section 22 is set to have an area larger than that of the fixed section 21 so as to be able to open the lower opening 13 half way or more.  A center of the rotation axis of the integral hinge 23, which couples the fixed section 21
and the rotating section 22 so as to be rotatable, is provided along a width direction of the vehicle 11.  Also, in the fixed section 21 fixed to the front body 12 by the bolts 24 and the nuts 25, a part of the bolts 24 and the nuts 25, that is to say,
five pairs of bolts 24 and nuts 25 are provided side by side along the direction of the rotation axis center of the integral hinge 23.  In this case, the bolts 24 and the nuts 25 may be arranged at substantially equal intervals.
 Also, the fixed section 21 is fixed to the front body 12 in an inclined state in which a vehicle front side thereof is inclined upward, and the rotating section 22 is mounted so as to close the lower opening 13 in a horizontal state.  More
specifically, in a state in which the rotating section 22 closes the lower opening 13, that is to say, in a travel state of the vehicle 11, the fixed section 21 is arranged so as to be inclined downward from the front body 12 from the front portion of
the vehicle rearward, and the rotating section 22, which is substantially parallel to a road surface, is arranged in succession to the fixed section 21.
 Further, a plurality of first reinforcing ribs 27 in a vehicle longitudinal direction are provided on an upper surface of the rotating section 22 side by side in the width direction of the vehicle 11.  Also, a plurality of second reinforcing
ribs 28 in the vehicle width direction are provided on the upper surface of the rotating section 22 side by side in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle 11.  Each of the first reinforcing ribs 27 and each of the second reinforcing ribs 28 intersect
with each other.
 In the above-described vehicle undercover 10 of this embodiment, in general, that is to say, when maintenance operation is not performed, the rotating section 22 is attached to the front body 12 by the clips 26 to be positioned horizontally. 
Therefore, since a lower surface of the front body 12 is maintained in a flat state by the rotating section 22, a gap is not formed between the front body 12 and the vehicle undercover 10, so that relative wind is prevented from entering at the time of
travel of the vehicle 11 and air resistance does not increase.
 On the other hand, when performing the maintenance operation, if the clips 26 are removed in a state in which the vehicle 11 is lifted up, the rotating section 22 becomes free and rotates downward to widely open the lower opening 13.  Therefore,
an operator can perform various pieces of maintenance operation from the widely opened lower opening.  In general, a position of an engine and a position for performing the maintenance differ according to a vehicle type, so that a common undercover 10
can be used by different vehicle types by providing the rotating section 22 widely opened in the vehicle width direction, and a manufacturing cost can be decreased.  In this case, the engine and an oil pan are located above the rotating section 22 so as
to be opposed thereto, so that the engine and the oil pan can be visually recognized from the lower opening 13 opened by the rotating section 22 and oil and an oil filter can be easily replaced using the lower opening 13.
 In this manner, the vehicle undercover 10 of this embodiment is provided with the fixed section 21 fixed to the front body 12 and the rotating section 22, one end of which is rotatably coupled to the fixed section 21 and the other end of which
vertically moves relative to the front body 12 so as to be able to open and close the lower opening 13.
 Therefore, since a part of the vehicle undercover 10 for covering the lower opening 13 rotates to open the lower opening 13, the gap is not generated in the undercover 10 itself and the rotating section 22 and the front body 12 are attached by
the clips 26 in the state overlapped with each other, so that the relative wind at the time of the travel of the vehicle 11 is prevented from entering, the air resistance does not increase and aerodynamic performance of the vehicle can be improved, and
as a result, a fuel consumption can be improved.  Also, when performing the maintenance operation, by removing the clips 26 and rotating the rotating section 22 downward, the lower opening 13 can be widely opened and the operator can perform the various
pieces of maintenance operation from the widely opened lower opening, so that workability of the maintenance operation can be improved.
 Also, in the vehicle undercover 10 of this embodiment, the vehicle undercover 10 is formed of the synthetic resin and the fixed section 21 and the rotating section 22 are rotatably coupled to each other by the integral hinge 23 along the vehicle
width direction.  Therefore, the manufacturing cost can be reduced and a structure can be made simple, and also, by rotating the rotating section 22, which closes half way or more of the lower opening 13, the lower opening 13 can be easily opened.
 Also, in the vehicle undercover 10 of this embodiment, the fixed section 21 is fixed to the front body 12 by the bolts 24 and the nuts 25 and the rotating section 22 is detachably attached to the front body 12 by the clips 26.  Therefore, the
fixed section 21 can be firmly fixed to the front body 12, and on the other hand, the rotating section 22 can be easily detachably attached to the front body 12, so that an effort of the operator at the time of the maintenance operation can be reduced.
 Also, in the vehicle undercover 10 of this embodiment, the fixed section 21 is fixed to the front body 12 by the bolts 24 and the nuts 25, and the bolts 24 and the nuts 25 are provided side by side along the direction of the rotation axis center
of the integral hinge 23.  Therefore, reaction force caused when the rotating section 22 rotates can be efficiently received by the bolts 24 and the nuts 25, so that this can be prevented from becoming large.
 Also, in the vehicle undercover 10 of this embodiment, the fixed section 21 is fixed to the front body 12 in the inclined state in which the side of the front portion of the vehicle 11 is inclined upward and the rotating section 22 is attached
so as to close the lower opening 13 in the horizontal state.  Therefore, a wide opening area of the lower opening 13 when the rotating section 22 rotates downward can be ensured and the integral hinge 23 can be easily set.
 Also, the vehicle undercover 10 of this embodiment is provided with the reinforcing ribs 27 and 28 on the rotating section 22 along the vehicle longitudinal direction and along the vehicle width direction.  Therefore, the reinforcing ribs 27 and
28 can be formed in succession to the rotating section 22, which composes a part of the vehicle undercover 10, and rigidity of the rotating section 22 can be ensured with a simple structure without making the reinforcing ribs 27 and 28 large.
 Meanwhile, although the vehicle undercover 10 of the present invention is composed of the fixed section 21 and the rotating section 22 in the above-described embodiment, the rotating section can be composed of a plurality of members.  Also,
although the fixed section 21 is arranged on the side of the front portion of the vehicle and the rotating section is arranged on a side of a rear portion of the vehicle, they may be inverted.  Further, although the rotation axis center of the integral
hinge is arranged along the width direction of the vehicle 11, this may be arranged along the longitudinal direction.  Also, although the integral hinge is applied as a rotary coupling section of the fixed section 21 and the rotating section 22, a
support axis or a rotation axis may be separately applied.
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
 As described above, the vehicle undercover according to the present invention improves the aerodynamic performance of the vehicle and improves the workability of the maintenance operation by being composed of the fixed section fixed to the front
body and the rotating section rotatably coupled to the fixed section so as to be able to open and close the lower opening, and can be usefully applied to any vehicle.

",,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The present invention refers to a crash box applicable in the automotive field and in particular usable as sacrificial element in a bumper structure of a motor vehicle.
 2.  Description of the Related Art
 Typically a crash box is able to absorb a portion of kinetic energy during a crash of a motor vehicle against an obstacle fixed or mobile.
 In particular the present invention is referred to a crash box of polymeric type, of the type realized in particular through injection molding and having a substantially alveolar structure, in such a way to have a good impact strength and high
rigidity, accompanied with a reduced weight.
 Each crash box shows a first frontal extremity which stand for first the crash, and a second rear extremity, which is constrained to a frame of the vehicle.
 Each crash box is in fact designed for having in the case of crash a permanent plastic deformation and a programmed collapse starting from a frontal portion towards a second rear portion of the same determining consequently a plurality of
folding starting from said frontal portion towards said second rear portion.
 In this way each crash box is able to absorb and to progressively dissipate a portion of kinetic energy through plastic deformation and by means of the propagation of said plurality of folding, maintaining a reduced volume and weight.
 A disadvantage of the polymeric crash boxes is that, in the case of a crash force angled respect to the first frontal extremity, it determines a bending moment which compromise the stability and, often determines a sudden failure or a
deformation of the rear extremity of the crash boxes, compromising their correct working during the same crash.
 Another analogue disadvantage is that in the case of a failure of a support element constrained to said second rear extremity, it determines an intensification of the stresses on said second rear extremity compromising the functionality of the
crash box.
 This because also in this case the plurality of folding start from said second rear extremity.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 Purpose of the present invention is that to realize a crash box having a better stability during a crash and that reduce at the minimum the possibility of a collapse starting from a rear portion of the same, and at the same time without make
worse the absorbing capacity of the energy during the crash.
 Another purpose is that to realize a crash box for a vehicle that permit to have a collapsing force most constant as possible during its crushing caused by a crash and that at the same time reduce at the minimum the probability of a collapse
starting from a rear portion of the same crash box.
 Still another purpose is that to realize a crash box that can be able to absorb also forces angled respect to a frontal portion of the same, reducing at the minimum the probability of a collapse starting from a rear portion of the same crash
box.
 Still another purpose is that to realize a crash box that can have an improved stability, maintaining the same absorbing capacity of the crash and without have to reduce the length of the same.
 Further purpose is that to realize a crash box for a vehicle that can be easy to realize and that can be economically advantageous.
 Further features of the invention are pointed out in the following claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES

 According to a preferred form of embodiment at least a part of said plurality of channels 30 internally shows a first minor medium rake angle 34 starting from said first open frontal extremity 12, which respect to an axis 95 of a correspondent
channel 30 shows a value preferably included between 0.01.degree.  and 1.degree.  and more preferably included between 0.01.degree.  and 0.5.degree., and a second greater medium rake angle 56 which is present only in proximity of said second rear
extremity 14 and besides which respect to said axis 95 shows a value preferably included between 0.01.degree.  and 4.degree.  and more preferably included between 0.5.degree.  and 2.degree..
 Preferably at least a part of said plurality of channels 30 only in proximity of said second rear extremity 14 results tapered in asymmetric way respect to an axis 95.
 Advantageously in this way it is possible to realize a polymeric crash box 10 simple to realize and with a reduced production cost.
 Preferably at least a part of said plurality of channels 30 results externally tapered going towards said first open frontal extremity 12 and besides shows externally a medium rake angle which respect to an axis 95 of each correspondent channel

of said crash.
 Said plurality of faces 13 has the function of reduce the initial stress during said crash in particular in the case of a crash force angled respect to said longitudinal direction 97.
 In this way it is also possible to have ever a surface of a face 13 which results substantially orthogonal to said angled crash force, obtaining consequently a better distribution of the stress on a greater number of channels 30 of said
plurality of channels 30.
 Vice versa without said plurality of faces 13 with an angled crash force would determine a distribution of the stresses on a very reduced number of channels 30 determining consequently a lesser crash absorbing capacity because the number of
channels 30 stressed would be inferior.
 Preferably said crash box 10 comprises fixing means in particular connectable to a frame of said motor vehicle, which are constrained or directly integrated with said second rear extremity 14.
 Preferably said fixing means comprises a plurality of holes which are obtained in said second rear extremity 14 and permit advantageously a reduction of the total weight of said crash box 10.

",,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The present invention relates to a work vehicle such as a TLB (a tractor with a front loader and a backhoe), a tractor, etc; and more particularly to a canopy device for use in such a work vehicle.
 2.  Description of the Related Art
 Conventionally, as a work vehicle, there is known one provided with a canopy device having a box shaped frame structure consisting of a pair of right and left front posts, a pair of right and left rear posts, and an upper frame structure
consisting of an upper front frame, a pair of right and left upper frames and an upper rear frame, and a roof mounted on the frame structure so as to cover a driving control device from above.  In this type of work vehicle, the front posts, the rear
posts, the upper front frame, the upper frames and the upper rear frame of the frame structure are formed straight and the roof is formed flat.  Then, when the front loader is pivoted to set a posture of setting a bucket attached to the leading end of
the loader to the uppermost position, the front end of the roof will be located on the line of sight of a driver seated at the driver's seat to visually recognize this bucket, so that the front end of the roof interferes with the line of sight of the
driver who looks up the bucket at its uppermost position.
 As a work vehicle capable of solving such a problem as above, e.g. JP6-0322188 A discloses a canopy device wherein the upper end portions of the front posts of the frame structure are extended closer to the rear side of the tractor than the
lower end portions thereof and the roof is offset rearward corresponding thereto.
 However, with the work vehicle of JP6-032188 A, the control section including the steering wheel is positioned forwardly relative to the roof, so that the steering wheel or the driver's hands gripping this steering wheel may be exposed to e.g.
raindrops.  Further, the driver's hands gripping this steering wheel or the like may be exposed to direct sunbeam.  Hence, the construction invites new problem that roof cannot fully achieve its object of protecting the driver from raindrops, sunbeam or
the like.
 In view of the above-described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a canopy device for use in a work vehicle, which device can ensure proper front-upper vision of the driver from the vehicle body while this driver is
seated at the driver's seat and which can also provide appropriate protection for the driver against sunbeam, raindrops, etc.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 For accomplishing the above-noted object, the present invention has the following characterizing feature.  Namely,
 A work vehicle comprising: a front loader mounted at a front portion of the work vehicle to be vertically pivotable; a driving control device; a canopy device for covering the driving control device from above, the canopy device including a roof
disposed upwardly of the driving control device and a support body for supporting the roof; and
 wherein said roof includes a front visor portion which projects, in a plan view thereof, to a position same as or more forwardly of a front end portion of the driving control device;
 to a lower face of said front visor portion, there are attached a pair of right and left front illumination lamps, and there is provided an upper concave portion at the right/left center thereof; and
 a lower face of said upper concave portion is formed as an inclined face which is inclined upward from a rear portion to a front edge of the front visor portion so as to be located at a higher position than the attaching position of the front
illumination lamps.
 With this construction, as the front visor portion of the roof projects to a position same as or more forwardly of a front end portion of the driving control device, the exposure of the driver's hands gripping this steering wheel or the like to
raindrops or sunbeam can be minimized.
 Further, with the upper concave portion formed in the front visor portion of the roof, it becomes possible to increase the elevation angle of the view of the driver operating the driving control device.  Therefore, it becomes possible to set the
line of view of the driver toward a position higher than the roof to a position closer to the vehicle body of the tractor or the like.  As a result, it becomes possible to ensure sufficient view to the front upper side for the driver.
 According to one preferred embodiment, when the front loader is pivoted to the uppermost position, the inclined face of the upper concave portion is located more upwardly of an upward view line from an operating space of the driving control
device toward the leading end of the front loader.
 With this construction, when the driver is seated at the driver's seat, this driver's view line looking at the leading end of the front loader set at its uppermost position is not blocked by the roof, so that the driver can reliably see this
leading end through the upper concave portion.  Hence, the front loader can be operated in a safer and more accurate manner.
 According to one preferred embodiment, the roof has a center-elevated shape and an upper face of the roof corresponding to the upper concave portion of the front visor portion has an upward curved bulging shape and is located at the same level
as the highest level of the roof.
 With this construction, it becomes possible to provide the upper concave portion in the front visor portion of the roof without increasing the highest level of the roof.  Hence, it becomes possible to avoid enlargement of the canopy device.
 Further and other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings.
 Incidentally, it is understood that, unless indicated otherwise explicitly, the direction of the vehicle body traveling straight forward (forward traveling) will be referred to as ""front/rear direction"" used as a reference and the horizontal
direction normal to this front/rear direction will be referred to as ""right/left direction"" (or lateral direction), and the direction perpendicular to both the front/left direction and the right/left direction will be referred as ""vertical direction"",
respectively. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 One preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.
 As shown in FIG. 1, a work vehicle 1 according to this embodiment is a work vehicle so-called a TLB (a tractor with a front loader and a backhoe), wherein a front loader (an implement) 3 is detachably attached to a front portion of a tractor 2
and a backhoe 4 is detachably attached to a rear portion of the same.
 The front loader 3 employed is a brace-less front loader.
 Further, the work vehicle 1 includes a canopy device 5 having a four-post ROPS (Roll-Over Protective Structure) including a FOPS (Falling-Object Protective Structure) function.
 A vehicle body 2A of the tractor 2 includes a front-mounted engine 6, and a transmission case 7 directly coupled to the rear portion of this engine 6 and is supported on a pair of right and left front wheels 8 and a pair of right and left rear
wheels 9 so as to be capable of traveling.
 The transmission case 7 includes a clutch housing connected to the rear portion of the engine 6 via a flywheel housing, etc.; a gearbox connected to a rear end of the clutch housing and formed integrally with or separately from the clutch
housing, etc.
 To a lower portion of right/left sides of the engine 6, there is attached and fixed, with e.g. a plurality of bolts, a front axle frame 12 which extends forwardly from the side of the engine 6.
 Further, at a rear portion of the tractor body 2A, there is attached and fixed, with e.g. a plurality of bolts, a rear axle case 13 which projects outward in the right/left direction from the right and left sides of the transmission casing.  To
this rear axle case 13, right/left rear axles rotatably driven by the power from the engine 6 are supported to be rotatable about a right/left axis, and the rear wheels 9 are mounted on the respective rear axles.
 On the right/left positions of the work vehicle 1 inward of the respective rear wheels 9, there are disposed fenders 15 for covering the rear wheels 9.  Between the right and left pair of fenders 15 and upwardly of the transmission case 7, there
is mounted a driving control device 40, and the canopy device 5 is mounted to cover this driving control device 40 from above.
 The tractor body 2A includes an attaching frame 80, and this attaching frame 80 has its front portion attached and fixed to the front axle frame 12 and has its rear portion attached and fixed to the rear axle case 13.  At a front portion of this
attaching frame 80, there are provided masts 81 which project upward.  And, the front loader 3 is attached to a loader attaching portion (an implement attaching portion) provided at an upper portion of each mast 81, and at a rear portion of the attaching
frame 80, the backhoe 4 is attached.  Further, to this attaching frame 80, there is supported the canopy device 5 surrounding the driving control device 40.
 As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 7, the driving control device 40 includes a floor sheet 41 mounted on the transmission case 7, a control portion 42 mounted on the floor sheet 41 and rearwardly and upwardly of the engine 6, and a driver's seat 43
mounted rearwardly of the control portion 42.
 The control portion 42 is used mainly for controlling the tractor body 2A and the front loader 3 and includes a front console cover 44 having a meter panel, etc., and a steering wheel 45 projecting rearward from the front console cover 44.
 The driver's seat 43 is supported to be pivotable about a vertical axis via a pivot rotation device 46 mounted on the floor sheet 41 so as to be switchable between a front facing posture for operating the tractor 2 and/or the front loader 3 and
a rear facing posture for controlling the backhoe 4.
 The canopy device 5 includes a roof 50 positioned upwardly of the driving control device 40 and a support body 51 supporting the roof 50 and surrounding the driving control device 40.
 As shown in FIGS. 5-7, the support body 51 has a box-like shape and includes a pair of right and left front posts 52 disposed at front portions and a pair of right and left rear posts 53 disposed at rear portions, and further includes an upper
front frame 54 interconnecting upper ends of the pair of right and left front posts 52, an upper rear frame 55 interconnecting upper ends of the pair of right and left rear posts 53, and a pair of right and left upper frames 56 interconnecting the upper
ends of the front and rear posts 52, 53 disposed on the same right/left side.  The upper front frame 54, the upper rear frame 55 and the pair of right and left upper frames 56 together constitute an upper frame structure 57.
 Each of the pair of right and left front posts 52 have a lower end thereof connected via fasteners such as bolts, to the upper end of the mast 81 and is bent at vertically intermediate portions thereof to extend with rearward upward inclination
toward the rear portion of the tractor body 2A as it extends upward.  Further, each front post 52, as being attached to the mast 81, has its lower end located forwardly of the front console cover 44 of the driving control device 40 and has its upper end
located upwardly of the front console cover 44 and slightly forwardly of the leading end of the steering wheel 45.
 Each rear post 53 is located rearwardly of the front post 52 located on the same side and extends vertically with its lower end connected via fasteners such as bolts, to a post attaching portion 82 formed at the rear end of the attaching frame
80.  Further, each rear post 53 is located rearwardly of the driver's seat 43 of the driving control device 40 and has its upper end bent toward the right/left inner side and connected to the upper rear frame 55.  The height position of the upper end of
the rear post 53 is about same as the height position of the rear end of the front post 52.  And, at the upper end of each rear post 53, there is provided, as a projection, a bracket portion 59 supporting a rear work lamp 58.
 The upper front fame 54, the upper frames 56 and the upper rear frame 55 are formed each of an angular member having a straight center axis.  Further, since the height positions of each front post 52 and each rear post 53 are same as described
above, the upper front frame 52, the upper frames 56 and the upper rear frame 55 are supported, with their center axes oriented substantially horizontal, between the front posts 52 and the rear posts 53.
 As shown in FIGS. 4 and 6, the roof 50 mounted atop the support body 51 is formed as a hollow structure by blow molding of e.g. a synthetic resin, and includes an inner roof portion 61 which forms the roof back face side (lower face side) of the
roof and an outer roof portion 62 which forms the roof front face side (upper face side) of the roof.
 As shown in FIG. 2, the inner roof portion 61 includes a pair of right and left front connecting portions 63a connected to right/left connecting portions of the support body 51 for the upper front frame 54 and the right/left upper frames 56; a
pair, of right and left rear connecting portions 63b connected to connecting portions of the support body 51 for the upper rear frame 55 and the right/left upper frame 56; and, between the right and left front connecting portions 63a and the right and
left rear connecting portions 63b, a pair of intermediate connecting portions 63c connected to intermediate portions of the right/left upper frames 56.
 Further, the inner roof portion 61 includes a horizontal-face like flat portion 64 located at a central region thereof extending from the pair of right and left front connecting portions 63a to the pair of right and left rear connecting portions
63b.  This flat portion 64 forms a plurality of (in this embodiment, twenty) projections 64a projecting toward the outer roof portion 62.  As these plural projections 64a support the outer roof portion 62, this prevents the outer roof portion 62 from
getting dented due to an external load or shock and enhances the strength of the roof 50 as a whole.
 Incidentally, it is also possible to form these inner roof portion 61 and outer roof portion 62 as separate components, so that the roof 50 may be formed by placing the outer roof portion 62 over the inner roof portion 61.
 As shown in FIG. 7, the roof 50 further includes a front visor portion 65 which projects more forwardly than the front connecting portions 63a connected to the upper front frame 54 of the support body 51.  This front visor portion 65 has such a
projecting length that, when this portion 65 is disposed upwardly of the support body 51, its front edge may be located at substantially same front/rear position as the front end of the front console cover 44 of the driving control device 40.  With this,
the control portion 42 of the driving control device 40 may entirely be located immediately below the roof 50, thereby minimizing exposure of this control portion 42 to raindrops and sunbeam.
 As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, although a lower end of the front visor portion 65 bulges more downward than the flat portion 64, this is formed upwardly concave from the position forwardly of each front post 52 (from a rear portion of the front
visor portion 65).  To lower opposed sides of the front visor portion 65, there are horizontally provided attaching portions 66 acting as positions for attaching front illumination lamps 66a suspended therefrom.  At right/left center portion which is
between these right and left pair of attaching portions 66, there is formed an upper concave portion 67 extending to an even higher position than the right and left attaching portions 66.
 A lower face of the upper concave portion 67 includes an inclined face 68a which is upwardly inclined as it extends from the rear portion of the front visor portion 65 toward a front edge of the same so as to be located higher than the right and
left attaching portions 66; and a pair of right and left interconnecting portions 68b for smoothly connecting the respective right/left side of the inclined face 68a with the attaching portion 66 on the same side.
 As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the inclined face 68a of the upper concave portion 67 is formed with an forwardly upward inclination to the front edge of the front visor portion 65, with the position opposed to the inner side of the upper end of each
front post 52 being its rear lower end.  So that, the inclined face 68a is located upwardly of a straight line extending from a visual viewpoint P of a driver U seated at the driver's seat 43 to the leading end of the front loader 3 set at its uppermost
position.  Further, the inclined face 68a has an inclination angle along the above straight line relative to the horizontal plane.
 Further, the roof 50 includes a rear visor portion 69 projecting more rearward than the rear connecting portions 63b connected to the upper rear frame 55 of the support body 51.
 As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the outer roof portion 62 has a center-elevated shape and includes a front bulging portion 71 which bulges upward in correspondence with the upper concave portion 67 of the front visor portion 65.  The front bulging
portion 71 has its right/left center portion acting as the front visor portion 65 bulging and curved upward, and the height position of its top being set at the same height as a center-elevated portion H of the outer roof 62 shown by a
one-dot-and-one-dash line in FIG. 4.  With this, although the upper face of the outer roof portion 62 has the front bulging portion 71, it is possible to provide the upper concave portion 67 in the front visor portion 65 for improved visibility, without
increasing the maximum ground-height of the work vehicle 1.  Further, as the rear portion of the outer roof portion 62 is inclined downward toward the rear side, raindrops fallen on the front bulging portion 71 will flow also toward the rear portion of
the outer roof portion 62, thus providing efficient water drainage for the front bulging portion 71.
 As shown in FIG. 3, the outer roof portion 62 defines a water drainage trench 72 for efficient drainage of raindrops fallen on the roof 50 along an outer peripheral edge thereof.  This water drainage trench 72 includes a first trench portion 73
formed at the front upper portion of the front bulging portion 71 along the right/left direction and a second trench portion 74 extending along the lateral edges and the rear edge of the outer roof portion 62.
 Further, in the second trench portion 74, there are formed draining portions 77 at positions right/left outer obliquely forwardly of the pair of right and left front posts 72 of the support body 51 and rearwardly of the rear posts 53, so that
rain water flown in the second trench portion 74 will be drained through these draining portions 77 from the roof 50.  Between these draining portions 77 and the driver U seated at the driver's seat 43, the front posts 52 and the rear posts 53 are
located, so that the water falling from the draining portions 77 is shielded from the driver's field of view by the presence of the front posts 52 and the rear posts 53.  Hence, the falling water will not enter the view of the driver U to decrease the
visibility.

 As shown in FIG. 10, the rear axle case 13 has right/left inner side portions thereof each formed as a lid portion 16 for covering a brake case attached to a rear lateral side portion of the transmission case 7, and a support portion 18 is
formed as a right/left outer projection from this lid portion 16 via an engaging portion 17 having a cylindrical outer shape.
 As shown in FIGS. 9 and 14, the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13 is a portion to which the rear axle case attaching portion 87 of the main frame 83 is attached, thus supporting the main frame 83 thereto, and this support portion 18 is
formed in the form of a square column having a right/left axis, with its lower front face (contact face) 18a and its lower rear face (contact face) 18b being formed planar.  Further, each of these faces 18a, 18b defines one pair or a plurality of pairs
of bolt fastening holes 18c normal to the respective faces 18a, 18b.
 Further, the rear axle case 13 is disposed such that the lower front face 18a is inclined to extend progressively downward toward the rear side thereof and the lower rear face 18b is inclined to extend progressively downward toward the front
side thereof.  With this, the lower front face 18a and the lower rear face 18b are inclined relative to the horizontal plane.
 As shown in FIG. 14, the rear axle case attaching portion 87 of the main frame 83 forms an upwardly open concave forming portion 89 to be engaged with the engaging portion 17 of the rear axle case 13 from under, thereby to extend the rear axle
case 13 through the main frame 83.
 At a front portion 89a and a rear portion 89b of the concave forming portion 89 of the main frame 89, there are formed a plurality of bolt inserting holes 89c along the vertical direction.
 Between the concave forming portion 89 of the main frame 83 and the rear axle case attaching portion 66, there is provided an attaching tool 90, so that the main frame 83 is attached via this attaching tool 90 to the rear axle case 13.
 As shown in FIGS. 11-13, this attaching tool 90 is formed as a cast product having integrally a rear axle side connecting portion 91 to be connected to the rear axle case 13 and a frame side connecting portion 92 to be connected to the main
frame 83, respectively.
 The rear axle side connecting portion 91 is formed in the form of a V-shape to which a planar plate-like portion 93 is connected substantially perpendicularly and includes a pair of front and rear seat faces 93a, 93b in face-contact with the
lower front face 18a and the lower rear face 18b (a pair of contact faces) of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13.
 Referring to the pair of front and rear seat faces 93a, 93b, the front seat face 93a is formed with progressively upward inclination toward the front side of the main frame 83 and the rear seat face 93b is formed with progressively upward
inclination toward the rear side of the main frame 83.  Further, the front seat face 93a can be placed in face-contact with the lower front face 18a of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13 and the rear seat face 93b can be placed in
face-contact with the lower rear face 18b of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13, respectively.
 Further, these front and rear seat faces 93 are constructed such that when the front seat face 93a is placed in face-contact with the lower front face 18a of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13, the rear seat face 93b is placed in
face-contact with the lower rear face 18b.  Therefore, when the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13 is engaged with the rear axle side connecting portion 91 of the attaching tool 90, the lower front face 18a of the support portion 18 comes into
contact with the front seat face 93a of the rear axle side connecting portion 91 and also the lower rear face 18b of the support portion 18 comes into contact with the rear seat face 93b of the rear axle side connecting portion 91.  Therefore, by only
engaging the support portion 18 with the rear axle side connecting portion 91, positioning of this support portion 18 relative to the rear axle side connecting portion 91 can be effected very easily.
 Further, as the two lower faces 18a, 18b of the support portion 18 come into face-contact respectively with the two seat faces 93a, 93b of the rear axle side connecting portion 91, it is possible to sufficiently restrict occurrence of looseness
of the attaching tool 90 relative to the rear axle case 13 when the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13 is engaged with the rear axle side connecting portion 91 of the attaching tool 90.
 Further, the front seat face 93a defines, at positions opposed to the pair of bolt fastening holes 18c formed at the lower front face 18a of the support portion 18, a pair of right and left through holes 93c.  Also, the rear seat face 93b
defines, at positions opposed to the pair of bolt fastening holes 18c formed at the lower rear face 18b of the support portion 18, a pair of right and left through holes 93c.
 At the connecting portion of the pair of plate-like portions 93 of the rear axle side connecting portion 91, there is formed a reinforcing rib 94 at a position opposite to the seat face 93.  This rib 94 includes a main rib portion 95 formed
along the connecting portion, a front rib portion 96 extending obliquely from the main rib portion 95 toward the forward lower side, and a rear rib portion 96 extending obliquely from the main rib portion 95 toward the rear upper side.  Further, at the
outer end portion of the main rib portion 95, there is provided a check chain attaching portion 95a for attaching a check chain for checking movement of a lower link (not shown) of a three-point link mechanism attached to a rear portion of the tractor
vehicle body 2A.
 The frame side connecting portion 92 includes a plate-like front connecting portion 98 to be connected to the front side portion 89a of the concave forming portion 89 of the main frame 83 and a plate-like connecting portion 99 to be connected to
the rear side portion 89b (the concave opening side) of the same.
 Further, the front side connecting portion 98 is formed like a plate having a plate face extending along the right/left direction and is formed by continuously connecting the right/left center portion of the plate-like portion 93 having the
front seat face 93a of the rear axle side connecting portion 91, and the main rib portion 95 and front rib portion 96 of the rib 94.  Further, the front end of the front connecting portion 98 projects more forwardly than the plate-like portion 93 having
the front seat face 93a of the rear axle connecting portion 91.  Further, the front connecting portion 98 includes, at the front end and at a lower end thereof downwardly of the plate-like portion 93, boss portions 100 having bolt inserting holes 100a
along the right/left direction.  Further, at the lower boss portion 100, there is provided a reinforcing rib 101 in the form of a downward projection.
 Incidentally, at the front portion 89a of the concave forming portion 89 of the main frame 83, a bolt fixing nut 102 is fixed by means of e.g. welding, at the bolt inserting hole 89 provided at the position of the front connecting portion 98 of
the attaching tool 90 in opposition to the boss portion 100.
 Further, the rear side connecting portion 99 is formed like a plate having a plate face extending along the right/left direction and is formed by continuously connecting the right/left center portion of the plate-like portion 93 having the rear
seat face 93b of the rear axle side connecting portion 91, and the main rib portion 95 and rear rib portion 97 of the rib 94.  Further, the rear end of the rear connecting portion 99 projects more rearwardly and upwardly than the plate-like portion 93
having the rear seat face 93b of the rear axle connecting portion 91.  Further, the rear connecting portion 99 includes, at the rear end and at a lower end thereof between the plate-like portion 93 and rear rib portion 97, boss portions 100 having bolt
inserting holes 100a along the right/left direction.  Further, at the lower boss portion 100, there is provided a reinforcing rib 102 in the form of an upward projection.
 Incidentally, at the rear portion 89b of the concave forming portion 89 of the main frame 83, a bolt fixing nut 102 is fixed by means of e.g. welding, at the bolt inserting hole 89c provided at the position of the rear connecting portion 99 of
the attaching tool 90 in opposition to the boss portion 100.
 The pair of seat faces 93 of the rear axle side connecting portion 91 of the attaching tool 90 and the planar face of the frame side connecting portion 92 extend normal to each other.  Further, the contact face of each boss portion 100 which
comes into face-contact with the main frame 83 is formed parallel with the planar face of the frame side connecting portion 92, so that this contact face and the pair of seat faces 93 extend normal to each other.
 Further, as shown in FIG. 16, the front side portion 89a and the rear side portion 89b of the concave forming portion 89 of the main frame 83 have their lower ends interconnected via the frame side connecting portion 92 of the attaching tool 90
and have their upper ends interconnected via the connecting plate 105.
 Referring to the connecting plate 105, its front end portion can be overlapped in right/left direction with the upper end portion of the front side portion 89a and its rear end portion can be overlapped in right/left direction with the upper end
portion of the rear side portion 89b, and includes through holes 105a at positions opposed to the plurality of bolt inserting holes 89c of the respective side portions 89a, 89b.
 In order to attach the main frame 83 to the rear axle case 13, first, as illustrated in FIG. 14 and FIG. 15, the rear axle side connecting portion 91 of the attaching tool 90 will be engaged with the engaging portion 17 of the rear axle case 13
from under side thereof and the lower front face 18a of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13 will be placed into contact with the front seat face 93a of the rear axle side connecting portion 91 and also the lower rear face 18b of the support
portion 18 will be placed in contact with the rear side.  In this, as the angle between the pair of seat faces 93 is 90 degrees and the angle between the lower front face 18a and the lower rear face 18b is also 90 degrees, by only engaging the rear axle
connecting portion 91 from under the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13, at the same time when the lower front face 18a of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 18 comes into face contact with the front seat face 93a of the rear axle side
connecting portion 91, the lower front face 18a of this support portion 18 will come into face contact with the rear face.  Hence, these positioning operations of the attaching tool 90 to the rear axle case 13 can be carried out very easily.
 Then, into the pair of bolt inserting holes 93c formed in the front seat face 93a of the rear axle side connecting portion 91, bolts with head B will be inserted respectively and then threaded with the bolt fastening holes 18c defined in the
lower front face 18a of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13, and also into the pair of bolt inserting holes 13c formed in the rear seat face 93b of the rear axle side connecting portion 91, bolts with head B will be inserted respectively and
then threaded with the bolt fastening holes 18c defined in the lower rear face 18b of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13,
 With the above, the attaching tool 90 is fastened to the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13.
 Next, from the lower side of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13, the rear portion of the main frame 83 will be brought closer to engage the support portion 18 with the concave forming portion 89, in this, the respect boss portions
100 of the frame side connecting portion 92 of the attaching tool 90 will be brought into opposition to the bolt inserting holes 89c having the nuts 102 of the front side portion 89a and rear side portion 89b of the concave forming portion 89 of the main
frame 83.  Then, bolts with head are inserted in the respective boss portions 100 ad fasted in the bolt inserting holes 80c.  With this, the main frame 83 can be attached to the attaching tool 90 and the main frame 83 can be connected to the rear axle
case 13 via this attaching tool 90.
 Lastly, the connecting plate 105 will be disposed upwardly of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13 engaged downwardly (to a deep position) of the concave forming portion 89 of the main frame 83 and this connecting plate 105 will be
connected via fastening tools, such as bolts, to the main frame 83.  This completes the attachment of the main frame 83 to the rear axle case 13 as illustrated in FIG. 16.
 Incidentally, it is also possible to temporarily retain the attaching tool 90 to the concave forming portion 89 by temporarily fastening the fasteners for fastening the attaching tool 90 to the concave forming portion 89 of the main frame 83. 
Then, by engaging the rear axle side connecting portion 91 of the attaching tool 90 under this condition with the rear axle case 13, the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13 and the rear axle side connecting portion 91 of the attaching tool 90
will be fastened and then the fasteners fastening the attaching tool 90 and main frame 83 together will be fastened fully.
 With the attachment of the main fame 83 to the rear axle case 13 by the above-described process, the two lower faces 18a, 18b of the support portion 18 can be placed in equally firm face-contact with the pair of seat faces 93a, 93b of the rear
axle connecting portion 91 of the attaching tool 90, thus effectively preventing occurrence of ""one-sided contact"" of the contact between one of the two lower faces 18a (18b) and the seat face 93a (93b) being looser than that between the other.  As a
result, there, is ensured appropriate load transmission between these lower faces 18a, 18b and the seat faces 93a, 93b.  And, it becomes possible to restrict inadvertent loosening of the fasteners such as bolts for maintaining these lower faces 18a, 18b
and the seat faces 93a, 93b under the face-contact with each other.  And, fatigue of the contact faces due to such loosening can be restricted also.
 Further, as the attaching tool 90 is formed by casting, this can be manufacture with extremely high precision, thus maintaining appropriate tolerance required for the fastening of the fasteners such as bolts.  As such high-precision attaching
tools 90 can be manufactured in mass scale, in manufacturing a plurality of work vehicles 1, the attachment condition of the main frame 83 to the rear axle case 13 can be maintained with high precision in each and every work vehicle 1.
 As described above, since the rear axle case 13 and the attaching tool 80 are fastened to each other by means of fasteners such as bolts and the main frame 83 and the attaching tool 90 too are fastened to each other by means of fasteners such as
bolts, even when there is a slight error in the attachment between the rear axle case 13 and/or main frame 83 and the attaching tool 90, such an error can be compensated for by fastening the attaching tool 90.  As a result, the attachment of the
attaching tool 90 to the rear axle case 13 and main frame 83 can be maintained appropriately.
 With the above-described attachment construction of the main frame 83, as the contact faces (upper face and lower face) of the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13 are formed planar and the rear axle case 13 is arranged such that these
contact faces are inclined relative to the horizontal plane, the load in the front/rear direction applied to the main frame 83 from the front loader 3 or the backhoe 4 can be vertically distributed at the attaching portions of the main frame 83 to the
rear axle case 13.  And, as the vertical load can be dispersed in the front/rear direction, the stress applied to the attaching portions of the main frame 83 to the rear axle case 13 can be effectively dispersed.
 With the above-described embodiment, as the front visor portion 65 of the roof 50 projects forwardly to the position substantially same as the front edge of the driving control portion 42, the driving control device 40 including a driver U
seated at the driver's seat 43 can be properly protected from sunshine, raindrops, etc. Further, as the upper concave portion 67 is formed in the front visor portion 65, good visibility for the driver U to the front upper side can be assured and the
visibility for the driver U can be assured by the upper concave portion 67 even when the bucket 32 of the front loader 3 is located at its uppermost position.  The roof 50 does not interfere with the line of view for the driver U looking at the bucket
32.  So, the driver U, at his/her normal driving posture, can operate with visually confirming the bucket 32, whereby the operational efficiency can be improved.
 Moreover, according to the present embodiment, with the relative engagement of the attaching tool 90 to the rear axle case 13 from its underside, the positioning of the rear axle case 13 relative to the attaching tool 90 can be effected with
precision, and the attachment of these rear axle cases 13 to the attaching tools 90 can be carried out very easily and precisely.  With this, the efficiency of the attaching operation of the main frame 83 (attaching frame 81) to the rear axle case 13 is
improved and also, the attachment of the main frame 83 to the rear axle case 13 can be maintained with high precision.  As a result, the load transmission between the rear axle case 13 and the main frame 83 can be effected appropriately.  As a result, no
fatigue or the like will occur in the contacting faces between the rear axle case 13 and the attaching tool 90 and between the attaching tool 90 and the main frame 83, and loosening in these attachments can be minimized.
 The foregoing has explained an embodiment of the present invention in details.  However, the present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiment.  For instance, the pair of front and rear seat faces 93a, 93b need not necessarily be
continuous with each other.  Instead, these may be spaced apart from each other in the form of reverse mutually widening layout as long as these are provided as seat faces 93a, 93b corresponding to the respective lower faces of the support portion 18 of
the rear axle case 13.  Further, what is required for the support portion 18 of the rear axle case 13 is having the lower faces 18a, 18b which come into face-contact with the pair of front and rear seat faces 93a, 93b of the rear axle side connecting
portion 91 of the attaching tool 90.  As long as this requirement is met, the portion can have a polygonal column shape, such as a hexagonal or octagonal column, or this can have such as shape as interconnecting, via a curved face, the ends of these
paired lower faces 18a, 18b.
 Moreover, instead of the above-described TLB, the work vehicle 1 can be a front loader vehicle having only a loader at its front portion.

 1.  Field of the Invention
 Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a rollover protection (ROP) cab.
 2.  Description of the Related Art
 Large off-road machines are employed for moving large quantities of earth, such as in building highways or dams, and are used in hauling ore as a part of mining operations.  These large machines are required to travel at fairly fast speeds for
efficiency and economy of operation and normally travel on temporary road surfaces or over terrain on which work is being preformed.  For this reason, these large off-road machines are somewhat dangerous to operate since conditions do not permit
construction of smooth, level roadbeds in most work situations.  With the heavy loads, at fairly fast speeds and uneven terrain, the possibility of rollover of large machines, while relatively infrequent, nevertheless, is a safety concern of
manufacturers and users of such machines.  For this reason, chassis of these machines include a protective structure for the cab, commonly known as a rollover protection structure (ROPS).  This requires extensive additional design and testing of the
vehicle chassis.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a rollover protection (ROP) cab.  In one embodiment, a rollover protection cab for a construction vehicle includes a structural frame defining cabin space for a vehicle operator.  The
structural frame is operable to substantially maintain the cabin space while withstanding a crushing load greater than or equal to twenty tons.  The cab further includes a window; a door; a seat disposed in the cabin space; and controls for operating the
vehicle disposed in the cabin space.
 In another embodiment, a crawler includes an undercarriage and a main assembly.  The undercarriage includes a lower frame; and two tracks.  Each track includes a track frame coupled to the lower frame; and a track shoe supported by the track
frame and movable around the track frame.  The main assembly is supported by the undercarriage so that the main assembly may rotate relative to the undercarriage.  The main assembly includes a main frame; a boom pivoted to the main frame; and a rollover
protection cab fastened to the main frame.  The cab includes a structural frame defining cabin space for an operator.  The structural frame is operable to substantially maintain the cabin space while withstanding at least a substantial portion of a
weight of the crawler.  The structural frame is independent from the main frame.  The cab further includes a window; a door; and a seat disposed in the cabin space. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

seat 35) may be disposed within a cabin space defined by the structural frame 5.  The body panels 20,r,b,d may be plates and welded (i.e., 20b,d) or fastened (i.e., 20,r) to the structural frame 5.  The control panel 20c may be fastened to the structural
frame 5.
 The structural frame 5 may be made from heavy-wall steel pipe and have adequate strength to withstand a crushing force, such as at least twenty tons, fifty tons, one hundred tons, or two hundred fifty tons.  Alternatively, the structural frame 5
may be configured to withstand at least a substantial portion of the weight of a construction vehicle, on which the cab 1 is mounted.  Additionally, the structural frame 5 may be configured to withstand the weight of the vehicle or the weight of the
vehicle plus a safety margin.  Alternatively, the structural frame 5 may be made from another alloy or metal or a composite, such as a fiber-resin composite.  Alternatively, the structural frame 5 may be made to meet or exceed any one or more of the
following standards: SAE J1040, ISO 3471, SAE J154, SAE J397, SAE J1043, SAE J1164, SAE J1194, and SAE J2194.
 The crushing force may result from tipping or rollover of the construction vehicle on which the cab 1 is mounted.  The structural frame 5 may withstand application of the crushing force from one or more directions, such as the force exerted on
top of the cab 1, the force exerted on the front of the cab 1, and/or the force exerted on sides of the cab 1.  The structural frame 5 may deflect upon being loaded by a weight of the vehicle; however, the structural frame may substantially maintain the
cabin space during loading, such as at least eighty percent, eighty-five percent, or ninety-percent.  Alternatively, the structural frame 5 may be made from other structural shapes instead of pipe, such as I-beam, channel, angle, or rectangular
(including square).
 The structural frame 5 may be integral to the cab 1 so that the cab 1 requires no rollover protection from the vehicle's chassis.  This independence allows for the cab 1 to be designed and tested separately from the vehicle, thereby freeing the
vehicle design from having rollover structure to protect the cab.  This independence may also allow the cab 1 to be modular with respect to an array of construction vehicles, including incorporation in newly designed vehicles or retrofit for existing
vehicles.
 FIG. 1E is a plan view of a control center 100.  The control center 100 may include the operator's seat 35, one or more hand-operable joysticks 105, one or more consoles 102, 103, one or more foot-operable pedals 106, and a video display 110. 
The consoles 102, 103 may include various pushbuttons and/or switches to control various functions of the vehicle.  Alternatively, the consoles 102, 103 may be located overhead instead of adjacent the seat 35 or some of the pushbuttons and/or switches
may be located adjacent to the seat and some overhead.  The video display 110 may be a flat panel monitor, such as LCD or plasma.  The video display 110 may display an operational status of the vehicle, such as video gauges, load graphs, and/or system
messages.  The control center 100 may further include a controller (not shown), such as a microprocessor, located behind the seat 35.  The controller may be in electrical, i.e., power and data, communication with the consoles 102, 103, joysticks 105,
foot pedals 106, and video display 110.  The controller may be in hydraulic and/or electrical communication with a manifold of the vehicle via conduits extending through the control panel 20c.
 The controller may include a load management system (LMS).  The LMS may be a include a variety of sensors in communication with the controller to calculate and display boom angle, boom capacity, and/or the boom load.  The LMS may include a
database of boom capacities for various operating positions and surface grades.  The LMS may alert the operator, with audio and/or visual warnings, when rated capacity is imminent, reached, and/or exceeded.
 FIGS. 2A-2F illustrate the structural frame 5 of the cab 1.  The structural frame 5 may include columns 6, beams 7, curved beams 8, and elbows 9.  The structural frame 5 may be connected by welds.  The columns 6, beams 7, 8, and elbows 9, may be
connected by butt-welds.  The structural frame may further include one or more sub-frames, such as floor frame 10, window frames 12b,d,f,,ra,rb,rc,t, door frame 27, body panel frames 18,r, climate control base 39, and control panel frame 18c.  The
sub-frames may be plates welded to the structural frame 5.  Openings may be cut out from the sub-frames before or after the sub-frames are welded to the structural frame 5.
 The windows 15b,d,f,,ra,rb,rc,t may be made from a transparent polymer, ceramic, or composite, such as polycarbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), tempered glass, laminated glass, aluminium oxynitride, magnesium aluminate spinel, or
aluminum oxide.  The windows 15b,d,f,,ra,rb,rc,t may be mounted on the window frames 12b,d,f,,ra,rb,rc,t by an adhesive or fasteners.  The windows 15 may be sufficiently impact-resistant to protect the operator from falling objects.  The front window 15f
may be curved to improve operator visibility forward and/or above the cab 1.  Some of the windows, i.e., the front window 15f and/or the window 15ra opposite the door 35, may serve as an escape-hatch for the operator.  These escape-hatch windows may have
quick-release fasteners 310 (see FIG. 3B) to allow the operator to release the window after rollover and be adequately sized for the operator to climb through.  Alternatively, the escape-hatch windows may be mounted so that the operator may detach the
windows by a kick from the seat 35.
 A seal 15s may be disposed on each of the window frames 12b,d,f,,ra,rb,rc,t, the floor frame 10, and/or the door frame 27 so that the cabin 1 is air-tight.  A filter may be disposed on an inlet of the climate control system 40 to filter exhaust
fumes.  The climate control system 40 may also maintain positive pressure in the cab 1 to ensure that any leaks are from the cab 1 to the environment and not vice-versa.  The cab 1 may further include an air or oxygen tank (not shown) so that if the
vehicle falls in water, the operator may wear a mask in communication with the tank.  The tank may store an amount of air or oxygen, such as one hour to twenty-four hours, to allow a rescue crew to retrieve the operator before drowning of the operator.
 The floor frame 10 may include angle or L-shaped beams having openings (i.e., nuts welded to holes formed therethrough) for receiving fasteners to retain the floor panels 11.  The floor panels 11 may be made from metal, alloy, or polymer.  A
doorway may be cut out from the door frame 27 for receiving the door before or after the frame is welded.  Hinges (not shown) may be welded or fastened to the door frame 27.  The door frame 27 may include a plate and/or L-shaped beam welded to the
structural frame 5.
 The mounting brackets 25 may be welded to the structural frame 5.  The mounting brackets 25 may have holes formed therethrough for receiving fasteners to retain the cab 1 to the vehicle.  The fasteners may be conventional (i.e., bolts or
threaded studs).  The fasteners and mounting brackets 25 may be configured to retain the cab 1 to the vehicle during tip-over or rollover (i.e., have a similar design strength to the structural frame 5).  The mounting brackets 25 may serve as the sole
support from the vehicle's chassis or main frame so that the vehicle chassis or main frame may omit a separate structure for the cab, thereby reducing expense of the vehicle chassis design.
 Alternatively, the fasteners may be frangible so that the cab 1 may detach from the vehicle upon a predetermined force exerted on the cab 1 during tipping or rollover of the vehicle.  Configuring the cab 1 to separate from the vehicle during
tipping or rollover may be beneficial so that the operator is not trapped within the cab 1 after the vehicle has rolled over, such as if the door 30 is sandwiched between the machine and the ground and/or the structural frame deforms and wedges the door
shut.  The predetermined force necessary to shear the frangible fasteners may be a ratio of the vehicle's weight, such as one-tenth to three-quarters or one-quarter to one-half of the vehicle's weight to ensure that the cab 1 separates from the vehicle
before the entire weight of the machine rests on the cab 1.
 FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate an alternative ROPS cab 300, according to another embodiment of the present invention.  The cab 300 may be similar to the cab 1 with the addition of a falling object protection shield (FOPS) 302.  The FOPS 302 may be
curved to correspond to the curved front window.  The FOPS 302 may include a frame 318, one or more plates 312u,, one or more pads 316, and one or more fasteners 310.  The FOPS 302 may include a pad 316 and fastener 310 adjacent each corner of the frame. The plates 312u, may be made from any of the materials discussed above for the windows.  The plates 312u, may each be bonded to the frame 318 and the pads 316 may be bonded to the plates 312u, A hole may be formed through each pad 316 and plate 312u, for
receiving a respective fastener 310.  A corresponding hole may be formed through the front window frame 12f for receiving each fastener.  Each fastener 310 may include a shaft 311, washers 319i,o, a spring 313, and pins 320i,o.  Each pin 320i may be
disposed in the cabin space and each pin 320o may be externally disposed.  The washer 319i may be disposed between the pin 320i and an inner surface of the window frame 12f and the washer 320o may be disposed between the external pin 320o and the pad
316.  The spring 313 may be disposed between an outer surface of the window frame 12f and an inner surface of the respective plate 312u,, thereby biasing the FOPS 302 away from the window frame 12f.  The fasteners 310 allow for the operator to quickly
release the shield 302 from the cab by pulling each pin 320i from the shaft 311.
 FIGS. 3C and 3D illustrate an alternative ROPS cab 350, according to another embodiment of the present invention.  The cab 350 may be similar to the cab 1 with the addition of a FOPS 362.  The FOPS 362 may be curved to correspond to the curved
front window.  The FOPS 362 may include a grating of curved beams, such as pipe, rods, or expanded metal or alloy, joined at each longitudinal end by beams 363, such as pipe or rods.  The curved beams may be spaced apart to allow visibility therethrough
by the operator.  The FOPS 362 may further include an actuator 365 rotationally coupled to one of the braces and mounted to the cab 300.  The actuator 365 may include a hydraulic or electrical motor to pivot the FOPS 362 between an engaged position as
shown and a disengaged position.  A switch may be disposed in the cab 350 to allow the operator to operate the actuator 365 between the positions.  The operator may desire the FOPS 362 to be disengaged during jobs that have a minimal risk of falling
objects to obtain better visibility and the FOPS to be engaged during jobs that have a substantial risk of falling objects.  Alternatively, the actuator may be omitted and the FOPS 362 may be manually actuated between the positions.  Alternatively, the
FOPS 362 may be fixed to the cab in the engaged position.
 FIGS. 4A and 4B are views of a crawler, such as an excavator 400, according to another embodiment of the present invention.  FIG. 4C is a view of a jackhammer 495 that may be used with the excavator 400 instead of a shovel 440.  The excavator
400 may include a main assembly 450a mounted on an undercarriage 450b so that the main assembly 450a may rotate relative to the undercarriage 450b.  In the position illustrated, a longitudinal axis L.sub.mf of the main assembly 450a is perpendicular to a
longitudinal axis L.sub.uc of the undercarriage 450b.
 The main assembly 450a may include a main frame 405, the cab 300, a boom assembly 420, a counterweight 445, and an engine 447.  The main frame 405 may have a front 405a and a back 405b distal from the front 405a.  The boom assembly 420 may be
pivoted 420p to the main frame at or near the front 405a.  The cab 300 may be fastened to the main frame 405 via the mounting bracket 25.  Alternatively, the cab may be fastened to the main frame via a hydraulic or electrical cab actuator (see FIGS.
5A-5D).  The cab actuator may allow the cab to pivot and/or elevate relative to the main frame 405, thereby allowing operator adjustment to improve visibility.  For example, the cab actuator may pivot the cab so that the curved front widow faces above
the excavator 400 for demolition work.  Alternatively, the cab 1 or 350 may be used with the excavator 400 instead of the cab 300.
 The boom assembly 420 may include a boom 420a and an arm or stick 420b pivoted to the boom 420a.  One or more first PCAs 425a may be pivoted to the main frame at or near the front 405a and pivoted to the boom 420a for articulating the boom 420a
relative to the main frame 405.  A second PCA 425b may be pivoted to the boom 420a and the stick 420b for articulating the stick 620b relative to the boom 620a.  A bucket 440 may be pivoted to the stick 420b.  A third PCA 425c may be pivoted to the stick
420b and the bucket 440 via a linkage for articulating the bucket 440 relative to the stick 420b.  Alternatively, a jackhammer 495 may replace the shovel 440 for demolition work.  Alternatively, a grapple, shear, or pulverizer may replace the shovel 440. Alternatively a demolition boom assembly may replace the boom assembly 420.  Alternatively, the boom assembly 420 may be removed and an adaptor fastened to the boom 420p and first PCA pivots to allow a crane boom to be pivoted to the adaptor, as
discussed and illustrated in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,003,252, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.  Alternatively, the adaptor may accept a pipelayer (i.e., A-frame boom) so that the pipelayer boom may be pivoted to the main frame using
the adaptor.
 The counterweight 445 may be vertically supported and longitudinally coupled to the main frame 405 at the back 405b.  Housed near the back 405b of the main frame 405 may be the engine 447.  The engine 447 may drive a hydraulic pump (not shown)
and a generator or alternator (not shown) for providing hydraulic or electrical energy to components, such as the cab 300, the PCAs 425a-c, and the track rollers 480 via a manifold (not shown).  Associated hydraulic and/or electrical circuitry (not
shown) interconnecting these components may also be provided.  The engine may be a diesel engine or an alternative fuel engine.  Examples of alternative fuel engines include diesel-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cells.  The diesel-electric hybrid may
use a smaller diesel engine and a bank of batteries (not shown) which would allow operation of the excavator 400 without operation of the diesel engine.
 Rotation of the main assembly 450a relative to the undercarriage 450b and support for the main assembly 450a by the undercarriage 450b may be provided by a rotary drive mechanism (not shown) and a bearing (not shown).  The rotary drive mechanism
may include a hydraulic or electric motor (not shown) attached to the main frame 405 and rotationally coupled to a pinion (not shown) which meshes with a gear (not shown) rotationally coupled to the undercarriage 450.  Operation of the motor may rotate
the main assembly 450a relative to the undercarriage 450b.  The rotary drive mechanism may further include a slew lock mechanism (not shown) for selectively rotationally coupling the main assembly 450a relative to the undercarriage 450b.  The slew lock
mechanism may include a gear tooth (not shown) selectively engageable with the gear via operation of a hydraulic cylinder or electic motor (not shown) and a proximity switch to verify engagement of the tooth with the gear.  Engagement of the gear with
the tooth rotationally couples the main assembly 450a to the undercarriage 450b.  Verification of engagement by the proximity switch also prevents operation of the motor.
 Alternatively, the slew lock mechanism may include a disk (not shown) incorporated in the motor and a retaining mechanism for retaining the disk.  The slew lock mechanism is such that when the rotary motor is stopped, the disk is retained by the
retaining mechanism to fix a rotor of the motor so as not to rotate, and when the motor is started, the disk is hydraulically or electrically disengaged from the motor, thereby freeing the rotor.
 The undercarriage 450b may include a lower frame 460 attached to the bearing and two track assemblies 475, each fastened to the lower frame 460.  Each of the track assemblies 475 may include a track frame 482 and one or more rollers 480a,b, such
as sprockets, operatively coupled to a track shoe or belt 485.  The track shoe 485 may extend around the track frame 482 and be movable relative to the track frame.  The rollers 480a, b may be supported by the track frame 482 so that the rollers may
rotate relative to the track frame.  One of the rollers 480a, b may be a drive sprocket and the other an idler roller.  A rotor of an electric or hydraulic track motor (not shown) may be rotationally coupled to the drive sprocket and a housing of the
track motor may be attached to the track frame.  A conduit, such as an electrical cable or hydraulic hose, may extend from the main frame 405 to the track motor.  The conduit may be connected to the track motor by a quick-connect fitting.  Operation of
the track motor may move the track shoe 485 relative to the track frame.
 Alternatively, each of the track motor housings may be attached to the lower frame 460 and each rotor thereof rotationally coupled to a respective drive roller via a removable shaft.  The shaft may be removably rotationally coupled at the track
motor.  Alternatively, each of the track assemblies 475 may be attached to the lower frame 460 by one or more telescoping axles (not shown).  The telescoping axles may extend to provide a wide footprint for operation and retract to provide a narrow
footprint for transportation.
 To facilitate disassembly of the excavator 400 for transport and re-assembly of the excavator 400 for delivery to the next job site, each of the track assemblies 475 may include one or more lugs attached to the track frame 482.  Each of the lugs
may include a hook and a hole.  Each of the lugs may be received in an opening of a bracket assembly attached to the lower frame 460.  The bracket assembly may include two plates spaced apart to define the opening, each plate attached to the lower frame
460.  Fasteners (i.e., a bolt or a pin) may each be disposed through corresponding holes in the plates.  To fasten each track assembly 475 to the lower frame 460, the fastener may be removed and the hook may be engaged with the fastener and the fastener
may then be inserted through holes in the plates and the hole and then locked to the track frame by a fastener (i.e., a nut or a clip).  The track conduit may then be connected to the track motor by the quick-connect fitting.  Alternatively, the lug may
be attached to the lower frame 460 and the bracket assembly may be attached to the track frame 482.
 To further facilitate disassembly for transport and re-assembly for delivery of the excavator 400, one or more outriggers 465 may be pivoted to the lower frame 460.  Each outrigger 465 may include a first arm, a second arm, a third arm, and a
pad.  The first arm may be pivoted relative to the lower frame 460.  The second arm may be pivoted to the first arm and retractable within the first arm.  The third arm may be retractable within the second arm.  The pad may be pivoted to the third arm. 
The outriggers 465 may be operable between an extended position and a retracted position.
 To remove the track assemblies for transportation, the outriggers 465 may be extended to support the main frame.  The boom assembly 420 may be used to hoist each track assembly 475 and load the track assembly on to a low-boy trailer.  Once the
track assemblies are loaded, a second low-boy may be backed underneath the excavator and the outriggers may then lower the excavator onto the second low boy.  The boom assembly may then be folded.  Alternatively, the excavator may be self-loaded on to
only one low-boy.
 Additionally, the cabs 1, 300, 350 may be used with other off-road vehicles, such as any type of crawler, such as cranes, side-booms, bulldozers, forestry carriers, waste handlers, or pipelayers.  Additionally, the cabs 1, 300, 350 may be used
for on-road or off-road vehicles, such as wheeled vehicles, such as tractors, loaders, skid-steers, forklifts, backhoes, articulated haulers, scraper haulers, motor graders, pavers, or compactors.
 FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate the cab 300 mounted on a cab actuator, such as a riser 500, according to another embodiment of the present invention.  FIGS. 5C and 5D illustrate details of the riser.  Alternatively, the riser 500 may be used with
either of the cabs 1, 350.  As shown, the cab riser 500 is mounted on a test stand 501.  The cab riser 500 may be fastened to the main frame 405 and operable to vertically move the cab 300 between a raised position and a lowered position relative to the
main frame 405.  In this manner, the operator may adjust the height of the cab relative to the main frame to obtain optimum visibility.  The cab riser 500 may raise the cab a maximum distance from a bottom of the main frame, such as one to six feet, such
as about two and one-half feet.
 The cab riser 500 may include a base 505, a frame 510, and a piston 515p and cylinder 515c assembly (PCA).  The frame 510 may be moved relative to the base 505 by the PCA 515p,c.  The frame 510 may include one or more guide sleeves 511 and one
or more brackets 512, 513.  The frame members 511-513 may each be fastened and/or welded together or integrally formed.  Each guide sleeve 511 may be fastened to the PCA 515p,c via the bracket 512.  The bracket 512 may be fastened or welded to the
cylinder 515c.  The bracket 25 of the cab 300 may be fastened to the frame bracket 513.  The PCA 515p,c may be operable to raise or lower the frame 510 (and cab 300) relative to the base 505 (and main frame 405) via injection and/or removal of hydraulic
fluid via one or more ports 515h.  Alternatively, an electric motor may be used to raise or lower the base 505 instead of the PCA 515p,c.  The PCA 515p,c may be in fluid communication with the hydraulic system of the excavator 400 via a hydraulic
conduit, such as a hose (not shown).  The cab riser 500 may also include a lock (not shown) operable to retain the base 505 at a selected height.  One or more guide posts 525 may be fastened to the base 505 via brackets 526.  Each of the guide sleeves
511 may be laterally coupled to a respective guide post 525 and free to vertically slide along the respective guide post 525.  The piston 515p may be fastened to the base 505.  Upon removal of the test stand 501, the base 505 may be fastened to the main
frame 405.
 The riser 500 may further include one or more conduits 530.  The conduits 530 may each house one or more hydraulic hoses and/or electric cables (not shown) extending between the excavator manifold and the cab 300.  The conduit 530 may also house
the hydraulic hoses extending between the manifold and the PCA 515p,c.  Each conduit 530 may include a first end fastened to the base 505 via bracket 532 and a second end fastened to the cab 300 via bracket 531.  Alternatively, the second end may be
fastened to the frame 510.  Each conduit 530 may include a plurality of links 533, each link pivoted to other links 533 so that the conduit 530 may accommodate vertical movement of the frame 510 relative to the base 505.  Each link 533 or every other
link may include a top and bottom rung to house the cables and/or hoses, thereby protecting them from entanglement in the riser 500.  The links 533 may be made from a metal or alloy, such as steel.  Alternatively, the conduit may be a single member made
from a flexible material, such as a polymer.  Alternatively, the cab 300 may only be in electrical communication with the manifold via wireless power and data couplings, such as inductive couplings and/or RF transceivers.  Alternatively, the PCA 515p,c
may be inverted.
 While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.

",,"PRIORITY CLAIM
 The present application is a National Phase entry of PCT Application No. PCT/JP2010/071528, filed Dec.  25, 2009, which claims priority from Japanese Patent Application Number 2009-150946, filed Jun.  25, 2009, the disclosures of which are
hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
 The present invention relates to an automotive cowl louver support structure having right and left rain gutters that are attached to right and left front pillars supporting vehicle-widthwise both sides of a windshield so as to extend therealong
and that allow rainwater to flow down along the front pillars, in which vehicle-widthwise both sides of a cowl louver disposed between the windshield and a hood can be supported by lower portions of the right and left rain gutters and in which ornamental
surfaces of the rain gutters can be continuous with a ornamental surface of the cowl louver.
BACKGROUND ART
 A technique related to an automotive cowl louver support structure is described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 7-10037.
 In the cowl louver support structure described in Patent Document 1, a cowl louver is attached to a cowl panel of a body by a plurality of clips.
 However, as shown in, for example, FIG. 1, in an automobile provided with rain gutters 102 that allow rainwater on a windshield G to flow down along front pillars 101, it is common practice that vehicle-widthwise both ends of a cowl louver 104
are supported by lower portions of the right and left rain gutters 102.
 That is, as shown in FIG. 6(A), the lower portions of the rain gutters 102 capable of supporting the cowl louver 104 are provided with support plates 103 that project inwardly in a vehicle-widthwise direction.  The support plates 103 have
substantially V-shaped notches 103c that are formed in front end edges thereof.
 Further, as shown in FIG. 6(B), hook portions 106 are formed in the vehicle-widthwise both ends of the cowl louver 104.  The hook portions 106 project downwardly from back side of the cowl louver 104 and are bent backwardly so as to have a
substantially J-shape in side view.  Further, when a back end edge upper portion 104f of the cowl louver 104 is disposed on a lower end periphery of the windshield G, the hook portions 106 of the cowl louver 104 are hooked on the notches 103c of the
support plates 103 from before and below, so that vehicle-widthwise both sides of the cowl louver 104 can be connected to the lower portions of the right and left rain gutters 102.  Further, in this condition, ornamental surfaces 102e of the rain gutters
102 and a ornamental surface 104e of the cowl louver 104 can be continuous with each other.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Problem to be Solved by the Invention
 In the above-described cowl-louver support structure, the hook portions 106 of the cowl louver 104 are hooked on the notches 103c of the support plates 103 of the rain gutters 102 from below, so that both members 104 and 102 can be connected to
each other (FIG. 6(B)).  Therefore, for example, when a downward force is applied to the cowl louver 104, the support plates 103 of the rain gutters 102 cannot support the hook portions 106 of the cowl louver 104, so that the cowl louver 104 can be
displaced downwardly.  As a result, steps can be formed in boundary positions K between the ornamental surfaces 102e of the rain gutters 102 and the ornamental surface 104e of the cowl louver 104.  This may lead to inferior appearance thereof.
 Further, the cowl louver 104 and the rain gutters 102 can be engaged with each other at one position via the hook portions 106 and the support plates 103.  Therefore, the cowl louver 104 is likely to be allowed to rotate horizontally with
respect to the rain gutters 102.  As a result, gaps each of which the width is changed longitudinally can be formed in the boundary positions K between the ornamental surfaces 102e of the rain gutters 102 and the ornamental surface 104e of the cowl
louver 104.  This may lead to inferior appearance thereof.
 Thus, there is a need in the art to provide an improved automotive cowl louver support structure.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 A first aspect of the present invention provides an automotive cowl louver support structure having right and left rain gutters that are attached to right and left front pillars supporting vehicle-widthwise both sides of a windshield so as to
extend therealong and that allow rainwater to flow down along the front pillars, in which vehicle-widthwise both sides of a cowl louver disposed between the windshield and a hood can be supported by lower portions of the right and left rain gutters and
in which ornamental surfaces of the rain gutters can be continuous with a ornamental surface of the cowl louver.  Engaged portions are provided to lower portions of the right and left rain gutters.  Engagement portions configured to engage the respective
engaged portions of the rain gutters are provided to vehicle-widthwise both sides of the cowl louver.  When the cowl louver is set between the right and left rain gutters from a given direction, the engagement portions of the cowl louver are engaged with
the engaged portions of the right and left rain gutters, so that the cowl louver can be prohibited from moving vertically and rotating horizontally relative to the right and left rain gutters.
 According to the present invention, because the engagement portions of the cowl louver are engaged with the engaged portions of the rain gutters, the cowl louver can be prevented from moving vertically with respect to the rain gutters.  As a
result, for example, if an upward or downward force is applied to the cowl louver, the cowl louver can be avoided from being displaced upwardly or downwardly with respect to the rain gutters.  Therefore, any steps (differences in height) cannot be formed
in boundary positions between the ornamental surfaces of the rain gutters and the ornamental surface of the cowl louver.
 Further, because the engagement portions of the cowl louver are engaged with the engaged portions of the rain gutters, the cowl louver can be prohibited from rotating horizontally with respect to the rain gutters.  As a result, for example, if a
horizontally rotational force is applied to the cowl louver, the cowl louver can be prevented from being horizontally rotationally displaced with respect to the rain gutters.  Therefore, any unstable gaps each of which the width is changed longitudinally
cannot be formed in the boundary positions between the ornamental surfaces of the rain gutters and the ornamental surface of the cowl louver.
 Thus, a portion around the cowl louver and the rain gutter can have increased appearance.
 In the second aspect of the present invention, each of the engaged portions of the right and left rain gutters has a first receiving portion on which a first claw portion of each of the engagement portions of the cowl louver is hooked and a
second receiving portion on which a second claw portion of each of the engagement portions of the cowl louver is hooked.  The first and second receiving portions are positioned spaced away from each other in a back and forth direction.
 That is, a plurality of claw portions and a plurality of receiving portions that are respectively formed spaced away from each other are engaged with each other while the engagement portions of the cowl louver and the engaged portions of the
rain gutters are engaged with each other.  Therefore, the cowl louver can be effectively prevented from being horizontally rotationally displaced.
 In the third aspect of the present invention, each of the engaged portions of the right and left rain gutters is formed to have a groove shape that extends in the back and forth direction.  Each of the engagement portions of the cowl louver is
formed to have a ridge shape that extends in the back and forth direction.  Each of the engagement portions is constructed to engage each of the groove-shaped engaged portions of the rain gutters from before.  Each of the groove-shaped engaged portions
of the right and left rain gutters is shaped such that a width thereof can be increased forwardly and reduced backwardly.
 In this way, each of the groove-shaped engaged portions of the rain gutters is shaped such that the width thereof can be increased forwardly.  Therefore, the engagement portions of the cowl louver can be easily engaged with the engaged portions
from before.  Further, each of the engaged portions of the rain gutters is shaped such that the width thereof can be reduced backwardly.  Therefore, in the process in which the engagement portions of the cowl louver are engaged with the engaged portions
from before, the cowl louver can be positioned on a desired position with respect to the rain gutters.
 According to the present invention, any steps (differences in height) and unstable gaps cannot be formed in the boundary positions between the ornamental surface of the cowl louver and the ornamental surfaces of the rain gutters.  As a result,
appearance of the cowl louver and the rain gutters can be prevented from being deteriorated. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

 Further, a cowl louver 30 is disposed between the windshield G and an engine hood 40.  Vehicle-widthwise both sides of the cowl louver 30 are supported by lower portions of the right and left rain gutters 20, which will be hereinafter described. Further, in this condition, ornamental surfaces 20e of the rain gutters 20 can be continuous with a ornamental surface 34e of the cowl louver 30.
 <Regarding the Cowl Louver 30>
 As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3(A), the cowl louver 30 has a first ridge portion 31, a groove portion 32, a second ridge portion 33 and a ornamental portion 34, which are positioned sequentially from before backward side.  The first ridge portion 31,
the groove portion 32, the second ridge portion 33 and the ornamental portion 34 are respectively shaped to extend in a vehicle widthwise direction.  Further, a bottom portion 32b of the groove portion 32 of the cowl louver 30 is supported by a cowl
panel 16 (FIG. 2) from below.  Further, as shown in FIG. 2, a section defined between the first ridge portion 31 positioned at a forward end of the cowl louver 30 and an apex portion 33t of the second ridge portion 33 can be covered by a back end
periphery 43 of the engine hood 40.  Further, a weather strip 31w is positioned on and attached to the first ridge portion 31 of the cowl louver 30 while extending along an apex portion of the first ridge portion 31, so as to seal a space between the
engine hood 40 and the cowl louver 30 thereby.
 The ornamental portion 34 of the cowl louver 30 is a portion visible externally and has a seal member 34s that is attached to a the back end periphery of the ornamental portion 34.  As shown in FIG. 2, a lower end periphery Gd of the windshield
G is covered by the seal member 34s over the entire width in the vehicle widthwise direction.  A surface 34e of the ornamental portion 34 corresponds to an ornamental surface of the present invention.  Therefore, the surface 34e of the ornamental portion
34 may be hereinafter referred to as the ornamental surface 34e.
 As shown in FIGS. 3(A) and 3(B), the cowl louver 30 has engagement portions 37 that are formed in vehicle-widthwise both sides (right and left ends) of the ornamental portion 34.  The engagement portions 37 are constructed to be engaged with
engaged portions 25 (which will be herein after described) of the rain gutters 20, so that vehicle-widthwise both sides of the ornamental portion 34 of the cowl louver 30 can be connected to the lower portions of the right and left rain gutters 20 when
the portions 37 and 25 are engaged with each other.
 The right and left engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are formed symmetrically in the vehicle widthwise direction.  Therefore, a structure of the right engagement portion 37 will be described with reference to FIG. 3(B) as a
representative of the engagement portions 37.
 The engagement portion 37 has a plate portion 374.  The plate portion 374 projects downwardly from a back surface of the ornamental portion 34 and extends in a back and forth direction.  The plate portion 374 has a first claw portion 371, a
second claw portion 372 and a connection plate portion 375 that are formed in a right side surface thereof.
 The first claw portion 371 of the engagement portion 37 has a vertical plate portion 371w and a deck portion 371y that is projected backwardly from a lower end of the vertical plate portion 371w, so as to have a reverse-L-shape.  The first claw
portion 371 thus shaped is formed in a back end upper portion of the plate portion 374.  The second claw portion 372 of the engagement portion 37 is constructed of a chevron-shaped rib portion 372r and a deck portion 372y that is projected backwardly
from a lower end of the rib portion 372r.  The second claw portion 372 thus shaped is formed in a front side lower portion of the plate portion 374.  Further, the connection plate portion 375 is formed to be substantially parallel to the back surface of
the ornamental portion 34 while connecting a front surface lower portion of the vertical plate portion 371w of the first claw portion 371 and a back surface upper portion of the rib portion 372r of the second claw portion 372.
 Horizontally (rightwardly) projecting dimensions of the first claw portion 371, the second claw portion 372 and the connection plate portion 375 relative to the plate portion 374 are set to be equal to each other, so that the engagement portion
37 can be formed to have a ridge shape.
 <Regarding the Engaged Portions 25 of the Rain Gutters 20>
 As shown in, for example, FIG. 1(A), the lower portions of the rain gutters 20 are formed to project downwardly beyond the lower end periphery Gd of the windshield G. Further, as shown in, for example, FIG. 4(A), the engaged portion 25 is formed
in a lower left side surface of the right rain gutter 20.  Further, the engaged portion 25 is formed in a lower right side surface of the left rain gutter 20 (FIG. 1(A)).  Further, the engaged portions 25 of the right and left rain gutters 20 are formed
symmetrically in the vehicle widthwise direction.  Therefore, a structure of the right engaged portion 25 will be described with reference to FIGS. 4(A) to 4(C) as a representative of the engaged portions 25.
 The engaged portion 25 has an inner vertical wall portion 251 that constitutes the lower left side surface of the rain gutter 20, and an outer vertical wall portion 253 that is positioned substantially opposite to the inner vertical wall portion
251.  The two vertical wall portions 251 and 253 are formed so as to be higher in front portions thereof and lower in back portions thereof.  Further, back end portions of the inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 of the
engaged portion 25 are connected to each other by a back beam portion 254.  Also, front lower ends of the vertical wall portions 251 and 253 are connected to each other by a bottom plate portion 255.  That is, a front portion of the engaged portion 25 is
defined by the inner vertical wall portion 251, the outer vertical wall portion 253 and the bottom plate portion 255 and is formed to have a substantially U-shaped groove shape.
 Further, the engaged portion 25 has an opening 256 that is formed between the inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 thereof, so as to extend from the bottom plate portion 255 to the back beam portion 254. 
Further, the inner vertical wall portion 251 has a first receiving portion 261 and a second receiving portion 262 that are projected laterally into the opening 256.
 The first receiving portion 261 is formed as a portion on which the first claw portion 371 of the engagement portion 37 of the cowl louver 30 is hooked from before and below.  A rear end periphery of the first receiving portion 261 is connected
to the back beam portion 254.  That is, the first receiving portion 261 is positioned on a rear end position of the opening 256.
 The second receiving portion 262 is formed as a portion on which the second claw portion 372 of the engagement portion 37 of the cowl louver 30 is hooked from before and below and which supports the connection plate portion 375 from below.  As
shown in FIG. 4(C), the second receiving portion 262 is positioned on a the front end position of the opening 256 so as to have the substantially same height as the first receiving portion 261.
 As shown in FIG. 4(B), a distance between the inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 of the engaged portion 25 is set to be increased toward a front end of the engaged portion 25 at a position of the bottom plate
portion 255.  That is, the distance is set to be minimized at a position adjacent to the opening 256.  Further, the distance between the inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 of the engaged portion 25 at the position
adjacent to the opening 256 is set to be substantially equal to a width of the engagement portion 37 of the cowl louver 30.  Further, a distance between distal ends (left ends) of the first receiving portion 261 and the second receiving portion 262 and
the outer vertical wall portion 253 is set such that the plate portion 374 of the engagement portion 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be inserted therebetween (FIG. 5(A)).
 <Regarding Attaching Operation of the Cowl Louver 30>
 An attaching operation of the cowl louver 30 is performed after an attaching operation of the right and left rain gutters 20 is completed.
 That is, in a condition in which the right and left rain gutters 20 are attached, the engagement portions 37 that are formed in the vehicle-widthwise both sides (right and left sides) of the cowl louver 30 are engaged with the engaged portions
25 of the right and left rain gutters 20 from before.  As previously described, the distance between the inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 of the engaged portion 25 of each of the rain gutters 20 is set to be
increased toward the front end of the engaged portion 25 at the position of the bottom plate portion 255, which is shown in, for example, FIG. 4(B).  Therefore, each of the right and left engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be guided by the
inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 of the engaged portion 25 of each of the rain gutters 20.  Thus, the engagement portions 37 can be easily fit-engaged with the engaged portions 25.
 Further, as shown in FIGS. 5(A) and 5(B), in a process in which the right and left engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are pressed into the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 from before, the first claw portions 371 of the
engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be inserted into the openings 256 of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, so as to be hooked on the first receiving portions 261 from before and below.  Similarly, the second claw portions 372
of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be inserted into the openings 256 of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, so as to be hooked on the second receiving portions 262 from before and below.  Further, the connection plate
portions 375 of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be supported from below by the second receiving portions 262 of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20.  Further, as shown in FIG. 5(B), lower end surfaces 372e of the second
claw portions 372 of the engagement portions 37 can be supported from below by the bottom plate portions 255 of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20.
 Further, the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are pressed into the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 from before, so that the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be laterally constrained by the inner vertical
wall portions 251 and the outer vertical wall portions 253 of the rain gutters 20.
 That is, the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are engaged with the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, so that the cowl louver 30 can be prohibited from moving vertically and rotating horizontally relative to the rain gutters
20.
 Further, the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are engaged with the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, so that the ornamental surfaces 20e of the rain gutters 20 and the ornamental surface 34e of the cowl louver 30 can be
continuous with each other.
 <Advantage of the Cowl Louver Support Structure According to the Present Embodiment>
 According to the cowl louver support structure according to the present embodiment, because the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are engaged with the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, the cowl louver 30 can be prevented
from moving vertically with respect to the rain gutters 20.  As a result, for example, if an upward or downward force is applied to the cowl louver 30, the cowl louver 30 can be avoided from being displaced upwardly or downwardly with respect to the rain
gutters 20.  Therefore, any steps (differences in height) cannot be formed in boundary positions K between the ornamental surfaces 20e of the rain gutters 20 and the ornamental surface 34e of the cowl louver 30 (FIG. 5(A)).
 Further, because the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are engaged with the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, the cowl louver 30 can be prohibited from rotating horizontally with respect to the rain gutters 20.  As a result,
for example, if a horizontally rotational force is applied to the cowl louver 30, the cowl louver 30 can be prevented from being horizontally rotationally displaced with respect to the rain gutters 20.  Therefore, any unstable gaps each of which the
width is changed longitudinally cannot be formed in the boundary positions K between the ornamental surfaces 20e of the rain gutters 20 and the ornamental surface 34e of the cowl louver 30.
 Thus, a portion around the cowl louver 30 and the rain gutter 20 can have increased appearance.
 Further, each of the engaged portions 25 of the right and left rain gutters 20 has the first receiving portion 261 on which the first claw portion 371 of each of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 is hooked, and the second
receiving portion 262 on which the second claw portion 372 of each of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 is hooked.  The first and second receiving portions 261 and 262 are positioned spaced away from each other in the back and forth
direction.  That is, a plurality of claw portions 371 and 372 and a plurality of receiving portions 261 and 262 that are respectively formed spaced away from each other are engaged with each other while the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30
and the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 are engaged with each other.  Therefore, the cowl louver 30 can be effectively prevented from being horizontally rotationally displaced.
 Further, each the groove-shaped engaged portions 25 of the right and left rain gutters 20 is shaped such that a width thereof can be increased forwardly.  Therefore, the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be easily engaged with the
engaged portions 25 from before.  Further, each of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 is shaped such that the width thereof can be reduced backwardly.  Therefore, in the process in which the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are
engaged with the engaged portions 25 from before, the cowl louver 30 can be positioned on a desired position with respect to the rain gutters 20.
 <Modified Forms>
 Further, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, and the embodiment can be easily changed or modified without departing from the gist of the present invention.  For example, in the present embodiment, each of the
engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 is formed to have the ridge shape, and each of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 is formed to have the groove shape.  However, each of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be
formed to have a groove shape, and each of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 can be formed to have a ridge shape.
 Further, in the above example, each of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 has the two front and back claw portions 371 and 372.  Further, the engaged portion 25 of each of the rain gutters 20 has the two front and back receiving
portions 261 and 262 on which the claw portions 371 and 372 are hooked.  However, the number of the claw portions and the receiving portions can be appropriately changed as necessary.

",,"BACKGROUND
 The discussion below is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.
 Aspects of the present invention relate to a sunshade assembly having opposed longitudinal edges and opposed transversal edges, the longitudinal edges being adapted to be guided in non parallel guide rails, the sunshade assembly comprising a
flexible screen, said screen having a transversal edge connected to a beam, and having opposed lateral screen parts biased in lateral direction.
 A sunshade assembly known from the prior art is EP 2 230 115 A1.  This sunshade assembly has a cloth, which is movable and guided in guide rails, between a wound and unwound position.  Said guide rails are non parallel with respect to each
other.  A triangular flexible lateral element in the form of a lateral rollo blind is connected between the main cloth and one of the guide rails.  In an unwound position of the main sunshade assembly, the lateral rollo blind is unwound and covers a
lateral triangular area.  When the sunshade assembly is wound, the lateral rollo blind is wound as well.
 This prior art sunshade assembly solves the guiding problem of a sunshade assembly that has non parallel guide rails, however is rather complex in its functionality and it needs numerous parts for storing the lateral triangular areas of cloth.
 In general it is required that the cloth, and especially said lateral triangular parts are kept taut, without any wrinkles.
SUMMARY
 This Summary and the Abstract herein are provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.  This Summary and the Abstract are not intended to identify key features or
essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor are they intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.  The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted
in the Background.
 A sunshade assembly according to an aspect of the invention has at least one of said lateral screen parts configured to adjustably fold around a folding member through an angle of substantially 180.degree.  along at least a part of the length of
the corresponding longitudinal edge of the sunshade assembly.  The extreme ends of the lateral parts folded around the folding members are biased in lateral direction, so as to keep the screen taut across its lateral width.
 In one embodiment the lateral screen parts of the flexible screen are each folded around a folding member which is a wire.  Said wire may be positioned in or in the vicinity of the longitudinal guide rails and is kept taut in a longitudinal
direction, for example by tensioning it between a rollo shaft or rollo reel and a rollo beam, or in any other way known per se.
 To facilitate the lateral movement of the lateral screen parts around the wire, the wire may be equipped with a sleeve, which could be made of plastic, or any other suitable material.
 It is conceivable that the folding member is configured as a bending resistant rod, preferably made of steel or any other suitable material.  Said rod is stationary and may be connected to a stationary member of the open roof construction, for
instance to the respective guide rail on a first end, and to another stationary member on the other end.  It is also conceivable that only one end of the rod is supported by the stationary member of the open roof construction.  The longitudinal shape of
each rod substantially corresponds to that of the respective guide rail.
 In another embodiment, the sunshade assembly comprises a substantially rigid center member and two opposed rigid lateral members, said lateral members are pivotally connected with the center member in an area near a first transversal edge, and
are connected to a guiding member in the respective guide rail near a second transversal edge.  Said center member is also guided in the guide rail by a guiding member.  The screen is folded around each of the lateral members, whereby the area of the
lateral members adjacent to the screen have a rounded shape suitable to smoothly fold the lateral screen parts and guide their movements.
 A biasing element keeps the lateral screen parts taut in lateral direction, whereby the biasing element may be a separate part made of flexible and elastic material, sufficient to keep the screen taut, but also capable of being wound on a rollo
shaft in case the sunshade assembly is a roller screen.  Said elastic member is connected on a first end to one of said lateral screen parts and on a second end to the opposite lateral screen part, or said second end may be connected to the upper side of
the flexible screen, or to the center member, said second may also be connected to a beam, said beam forms a transversal edge of the sunshade assembly.
 In another embodiment the area of the folding member engaging the screen is covered with a friction reducing coating.  This facilitates movements of the lateral screen parts with respect to the folding members.
 In yet another embodiment the screen and the lateral screen parts may be made of different materials fixed, for example, stitched together, whereby the lateral screen parts may be made of an elastic material.  It is also conceivable that said
elastic flexible screen parts are biased in lateral direction and are connected to the upper side of the screen directly, thus avoiding a separate elastic member. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
 Referring to FIG. 1, a vehicle having an open roof construction in its roof is illustrated schematically.  Said open roof construction comprises a roof opening 1 in a stationary roof part 2 of the vehicle, such as a passenger car, and a movable
closure, for example a panel 3 which, by means not illustrated but known per se, can be moved for opening and closing said roof opening 1.  In the embodiment shown, the open roof construction is a so-called spoiler roof or topslider in which the panel 3
is moved from a closed position within the roof opening 1 rearwardly to an open position in which the panel is partly or completely above a roof part behind the roof opening.  Other closures, such as slats, a folding member and the like are useable with
aspects of the invention herein described.
 Below the roof opening 1, a sunshade assembly is arranged.
 Referring to FIG. 2, the sunshade assembly is configured as a so called ""rollo"" or roller screen which comprises a flexible screen 4 having opposed longitudinal edges (extending mainly in longitudinal direction of the vehicle) and opposed
transversal edges, the longitudinal edges being guided in non parallel guide rails 5, 5'.  Said guide rails 5, 5' may be straight or may have a curvature individually, but are aligned towards each other in such a way that they are diverging from each
other, in this case towards the front of the roof opening 1.
 A first one of the transversal edges of the flexible screen 4 is connected to a rotatable winding shaft 6 configured for winding and unwinding said sunscreen, a second transversal edge being connected to a beam 7 for tensioning and unwinding
said sunscreen in a longitudinal direction.  Said winding shaft 6 is known per se, and is therefore not further elucidated.  In FIG. 2, the sunshade assembly is shown in a rolled out or unwound condition in which it closes a passage in a frame of the
open roof construction below the roof opening 1.  The screen 4 is connected to the beam 7, in a way known per se, and is not further elucidated.  Each end of the beam 7 has a joint with a guiding member 10, 10'.  Said joint adapts to the changing
distance between the non parallel guide rails 5, 5' and one end of the beam 7, 7' when the sunshade assembly is unwound, or wound.  The joint might include a lever between the beam 7 and the guide member 10, 10', respectively, being pivotable on both
ends to take up the distance between the guide member 10, 10' and the respective beam end by pivoting.
 The changing distance between the non parallel guides 5, 5' is taken up by the screen 4 through lateral screen parts 8, 8', said parts moving in lateral direction and moving around a folding member 9A (see FIG. 3), and further in lateral
direction towards the opposite guide rails 5,5' when the screen 4 is wound or unwound.
 As mentioned, the sunshade assembly further comprises opposed lateral screen parts 8, 8' biased in lateral direction.  Said lateral screen parts 8, 8' may be made of the same material, and may be made in one integral piece, including formed from
a single unitary body, with a center part of the flexible screen 4.  On the other hand, the lateral screen parts 8, 8' may be made of a different material compared to that of the center part of the flexible screen 4.  It is also conceivable that the
lateral screen parts 8, 8' are made of elastic materials, and be connected with the center part of the flexible screen 4 by stitching, gluing, welding or any other suitable way known per se.
 Referring to FIG. 3, portions of said lateral screen parts 8, 8' are folded around the folding member 9A, are arranged vertically above the screen 4 and are directed in a direction substantially towards the opposing folding member 9A.  It is
clear that in an embodiment where the folding member 9A is a wire or other flat member, as is the case in the FIG. 3 embodiment, the portion of the folded lateral screen parts 8, 8' pointing in the direction towards the opposite guide rail may lie
substantially on top of and substantially in contact with the upper side of the screen 4.  The lateral screen parts 8, 8' may be of a substantially triangular shape, however any other shape, for instance rectangular, or circular shapes are possible too. 
The folded lateral screen parts 8, 8' may thus be folded around the folding member 9A in an angle of substantially 180.degree., however an angle slightly smaller or bigger is possible too.  In general an angle in a range between 160.degree.  and
200.degree.  would be sufficient.  In order to reduce the friction between the lateral screen parts 8, 8' and the folding member or wire 9A to facilitate the lateral movement of the lateral screen part around a substantial portion of the wire 9A and
along a substantial length of the longitudinal edge of the sunscreen 4, it is conceivable to have a flexible sleeve 15 around the folding member 9A, especially in case the folding member is a wire 9A or a bending-stiff rod 9B shown in FIG. 4.  Such a
sleeve avoids the risk of having excessive wear at the inside of the lateral screen parts 8, 8'.
 The lateral screen parts 8, 8' are biased in lateral direction towards the opposite guide rail 5, 5'.  The biasing force originates from an elastic member 14, which may be an elastic band, flat spring or equivalent.  It is important however that
the elastic member 14 has enough biasing force in lateral direction to keep the screen and its lateral screen parts 8, 8' taut across the width of opening 1.  The elastic member 14 needs to be flexible to such extent that it is able to be rolled up
together with the screen onto the winding shaft 6, without leaving marks on the neighboring screen material, when the rollo is unwound again.
 The elastic member 14 may be connecting the two opposite lateral screen parts 8, 8', however it is also conceivable that the elastic member 14 connects each of the lateral screen parts 8, 8' with the beam 7,7' (FIG. 8) or as mentioned before
connecting the lateral screen parts 8, 8' with the upper side of the screen 4.  The wire 9A will generally be wound together with the screen 4, for example on a reel arranged on the winding shaft.  One end of the wire 9A will therefore be attached to the
reel, the other end will be attached to the guiding member 10, 10'.  It will be kept taut between its ends so as to be able to withstand the tensioning force of the elastic member 14.
 Referring to FIG. 4, which also shows a sunshade assembly in the form of a rollo or roller screen, the folding member shown there is a bending stiff or rigid rod 93 in each guide rail 5, 5'.  Said rod 9B is connected to a stationary member of
the open roof construction, for instance to the respective guide rail on a first end, whereas on its second end said rod is also connected to the stationary member.  It is also conceivable that only one end of the rod is supported by the stationary
member of the open roof construction.  The portion of the folded lateral screen parts 8, 8' pointing in the direction towards the opposite guide rail lies substantially above and with a certain distance to the upper side of screen 4.  As the rods 9B are
stationary, the lateral screen parts 8, 8' will slide with respect to the rods 9B both in longitudinal and lateral direction.  The material of the lateral screen parts 8, 8' and rod 9B could be selected to obtain a low friction and/or the rod could be
rotatable.
 FIGS. 5, 6 and 7, show an embodiment of the sunshade assembly which is configured as a rigid sunshade screen or panel.  It comprises a center member 11, and two opposed lateral members 12, 12' and a beam 7'.  The sunshade assembly is capable of
sliding at each of the opposed longitudinal edges in a pair of opposed lateral guide rails 5, 5'.  Since the guide rails 5, 5' are non-parallel relative to each other, the lateral width between the longitudinal edges of the sunshade assembly varies from
a condition in which the width is of a certain minimal dimension, there where the distance between the guide rails 5, 5' is smallest, to a condition in which said width has reached a maximum dimension, there where the distance between the guide rails 5,
5' is biggest.
 To accommodate the difference in width the sunshade has a center member 11, and two lateral members 12, 12' pivotally connected therewith by means of pivot members 13, 13'.  Each of the lateral members 12, 12' has at least two guiding members
10, 10', connected therewith, directly and/or indirectly (as shown in FIG. 7).  Said guiding members 10, 10' are configured to slidably support the sunshade assembly in the guide rails 5, 5'.  The pivot members 13, 13' may be positioned in an area near a
first transversal edge of the sunshade, usually near the transversal edge where the sunshade assembly has a minimum lateral width.  Said pivot members 13, 13' are known per se, and therefore not further elucidated.  The pivot members 13, 13' are oriented
such that the lateral members 12, 12' pivot parallel to plane of the center member 11, and thus the pivot axis is oriented substantially perpendicularly to the plane of the center member 11.  The folding member in this embodiment is a rounded portion 9C
on the lateral outer side of the folding members 12, 12' where the lateral screen parts 8, 8' are folded or guided through substantially 180.degree., see FIG. 5.
 In a situation in which the sunshade assembly slides between an ""open"" position and a ""close"" position, as shown in FIG. 7, the lateral members 12, 12' will follow the curvature of the non parallel guide rails 5, 5' due to the engagement of
their guiding members 10, 10' with the guide rails 5, 5'.  When doing so, each of said lateral members will rotate around pivot member 13, 13'.  A screen 4 is arranged on the lower side of said center member 11, and the lateral members 12, 12', in such a
way that it is adjacent to the lower surfaces of said members 11, 12, 12'.  The screen 4 may be connected with the center member 11, in a way known per se.  It is also conceivable that the screen 4 is not connected to the lower side of said center member
11.  In relation to the lateral members 12, 12', the screen 4 is not connected to their respective lower and upper surfaces, since said member must be able to move in lateral direction.  As already explained before with respect to other embodiments, the
screen 4 has lateral screen parts 8, 8' which, in this embodiment, are folded around a rounded portion 9C of the lateral members 12, 12'.  The lateral screen parts 8, 8' are biased above the upper surface of the center member 11 and of the lateral
members 12, 12' in a direction towards the opposite guide rail 5, 5'.  In this case, the lateral screen parts 8, 8' are biased by their own elastic member 14, 14' which is connected to the respective lateral screen part 8, 8' on one end and to the center
member 11 on the other end.  The rounded portion 9c of the lateral member 12, 12', around which the lateral screen parts 8, 8' are folded, have a typical shape so as to ensure a reduced contact area and a minimum of friction between the two parts.  It is
conceivable that said rounded portion 9C of said lateral member 12, 12' is coated with a coating reducing the friction between screen and member material.
 It follows from the foregoing that an aspect of the invention provides a sunshade assembly that easily adapts to non parallel guide rails and nonetheless maintains an attractive appearance towards the interior of the vehicle in all
circumstances.
 Although the subject matter has been described in language directed to specific environments, structural features and/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not limited to the
environments, specific features or acts described above as has been held by the courts.  Rather, the environments, specific features and acts described above are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims.  In addition, features of one
embodiment may be combined with features of other embodiments.  For example in the embodiment of FIGS. 5-7, the guide members 10, 10' on the front of the sunshade may be movably attached to the center member 11 or the beam 7' and be movably attached to
the respective lateral members 12, 12'.  The center member of larger rigid sunshades may comprise several rigid parts that are interconnected in a movable manner, for example to follow curved roofs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 Referring to FIGS. 1 and 3, a sunroof 10 includes a panel 100, a warning apparatus 26, and a switch 24.  A vehicle 40 (see FIG. 7) includes a compartment.  The compartment has a vehicle roof 400 defining an opening.  The sunroof 10 is mounted in
the vehicle roof 400 at the opening.
 The panel 100 includes a cover 21 and a base 22.  A front end 11 of the panel 100 is oriented toward the front of the vehicle 40, and a rear end 12 is oriented toward the rear of the vehicle 40.  The cover 21 has a top surface 101 and an inner
surface 103.  The base 22 has a bottom surface 102.  The cover 21 has a first recess 210 defined in the front end 11, and a separate second recess 220 defined between the inner surface 103 and the base 22.
 The warning apparatus 26 includes a printed circuit board (PCB) 260 and a warning unit 262.  The warning unit 262 is electrically connected to the PCB 260.  The PCB 260 is attached to the panel 100.  In this embodiment, the PCB 260 is underneath
the base 22 and seals or covers the first recess 210.  The PCB 260 has a bottom surface 261 faces the inside of the vehicle 40.  The warning unit 262 is mounted on the bottom surface 102, particularly, underneath the bottom surface 261.  The warning unit
262 is configured to send an emergency alert signal when the panel is raised up to be substantially perpendicular to the vehicle roof.
 In other embodiments, the PCB 260 is available in many shapes and sizes, and the PCB 260 may instead be located underneath and cover the first recess 210.
 The warning unit 262 may be any one or more of a liquid crystal display, a light emitting diode module, and a reflective sign board.  Here, the warning unit 262 is a triangular light emitting diode module including a number of light emitting
diodes.  The warning sign can be easily seen by at least anyone approaching the vehicle 40 from behind when the panel 100 is raised up to an angle of, for instance, 90 degrees (see FIG. 4).
 Referring to FIGS. 3, 4 and 5, the switch 24 electrically connected to a power source is configured to switch on or switch off the warning unit 262.  The switch 24 has a first end surface 241, an opposing second end surface 242 substantially
parallel to the first end surface 241, and a third end surface 243 substantially perpendicularly connected to the first end surface 241.  A conductive member 28 is positioned between the first end surface 241 and the second end surface 242, and attached
to the third end surface 243.
 The first recess 210 has an opening and a bottom surface 2100.  The switch 24 is inserted into the first recess 210 extending through the PCB 260 and the opening, leaving the second end surface 242 contacting with a stopper 120 underneath the
first recess 210 configured for triggering the switch 24.  The first end surface 241 faces the bottom surface 2100.
 The switch 24 is spring loaded for automatic activation by placing a resilient member 27 applying a force to the switch 24 in a direction from the first end surface 241 to the second end surface 242.  The first end surface 241 is initially in
contact with the stopper 120 when the panel 100 seals the opening of the vehicle roof 400, and the conductive member 28 is disconnected from the PCB 260 (see FIGS. 2 and 3), and the warning unit 262 is switched off.  When the panel 100 is raised up to be
substantially perpendicular to the vehicle roof 400, the first end surface 241 leaves the stopper 120, the resilient member 27 rebounds activating the switch 24 so that the conductive member 28 is connected with the PCB 260, and thus, the warning unit
262 is switched on (see FIGS. 4, 5, and 6).  A variety of types of lifter mechanisms proposed could be used here to lift the sunroof 10 up to a desired angle relative to the vehicle roof 400.
 It is noteworthy that the stopper 120 is a part of the sunroof 10, or a part of the vehicle roof 400.  Besides the third end surface 243, the conductive member 28 may be attached to the other position of the switch 24 as long as the conductive
member 28 is capable of contacting with the PCB 260.
 Furthermore, the panel 100 includes an inner side wall 212 in the first recess 210.  The inner side wall 212 is substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface 2100.  A step surface 211 defined in the inner side wall 212 is configured to block
the movement of the conductive member 28 as well as the switch 24 toward the second bottom surface 2100.
 The vehicle 40 includes a power source 23.  Referring to the FIG. 3, the power source 23 is located in the second recess 220.  The power source 23 includes a sheet shaped solar cell panel 230, a sheet shaped battery 232, and a controller 234. 
The sheet shape of the solar cell panel 230 and the battery 232 allows convenient placement of the components inside the panel 100.  The power source 23, in another embodiment, is located outside the second recess 220 but in the sunroof 10, or inside the
vehicle roof 400.  Here, the cover 21 is transparent.  The solar cell panel 230 faces away form the inside of the compartment.  The warning unit 262 is electrically coupled to the solar cell panel 230.
 The solar cell panel 230 includes monocrystalline silicon solar cells, polycrystalline silicon solar cells, or a variety of types of thin film solar cells.  The solar cell panel 230 converts the solar energy into electricity.  The battery 232
stores the electricity.  The controller 234, electrically connected with the battery 232, controls the type of the current, direct current or alternating current, provided to the electronic devices of the vehicle 40, for example, the warning unit 262,
the interior ventilation fan, or the headlight.
 If desired, added protection for the solar cell panel 230 may be provided by the addition of a transparent plastic layer 235 and a transparent protecting film 236 on the solar cell panel 230.
 Referring to FIG. 8, the sunroof 30 of a second embodiment is almost the same as the sunroof 10.  A difference is, the switch 34 has a middle surface 36 substantially parallel and located between the two end surfaces of the switch 34, and a
conductive member 38 is attached to the middle surface 36.  When the switch 34 is activated by the resilient member 37, the conductive member 38 will contact a PCB 35, and the warning unit is turned on.
 Sunroofs adopting the present warning apparatus provide a safe and efficient method for deployment of hazard warning devices.  Furthermore, the sunroofs are environmentally friendly by using solar energy to provide the vehicle with electricity.
 It is understood that the above-described embodiments are intended to illustrate rather than limit the disclosure.  Variations may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit of the disclosure.  Accordingly, it is appropriate
that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the scope of the disclosure.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The present invention relates to a traveling apparatus that performs an inverted pendulum control to maintain an inverted state and travels with a passenger thereon, and control method therefor.
 2.  Description of Related Art
 Recently, there is known a traveling apparatus in which traveling operation of a vehicle body can be performed by forward and backward movement or the like of the center of gravity of a passenger.  Further, there is known a traveling apparatus
that includes an empty-vehicle control means that performs an inverted pendulum control for a vehicle body to be independent with no passenger riding on the traveling apparatus (e.g., refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No.
2007-331443).
 However, when a passenger rides on the vehicle body, the passenger operates a handle forward and backward, or inclines the vehicle body forward and backward without intention, so that in response to the movement, the vehicle body moves forward
and backward.  Therefore, it can become difficult for the passenger to ride on the vehicle body.
 The present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problem, and therefore has a primary object to provide a traveling apparatus on which a passenger can safely and easily ride, and a control method therefor.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
 Exemplary embodiments for carrying out the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.  FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a schematic system configuration of a traveling apparatus according to an
exemplary of the present invention.  FIG. 2 is a front view showing a schematic configuration of the traveling apparatus according to the present embodiment.  A traveling apparatus 10 according to the present embodiment includes a posture sensor 2, a
rotation sensor 3, a pair of wheel drive units 4L, 4R, a control device 5, and a pair of step sensors 16L, 16R which are provided in the vehicle body 1 shown in FIG. 2.
 The vehicle body 1 is configured so that, for example, a passenger can ride standing on a chassis 6 as a coaxial two-wheel vehicle of a standing type.  Further, the coaxial two-wheel vehicle is configured to, for example, move forward and
backward by forward and backward movement of a center of gravity of the passenger, and turn left and right by left and right movement of a center of gravity of the passenger.
 The posture sensor 2 detects posture information such as a pitch angle, a pitch angular velocity, a pitch angular acceleration, a roll angle, a roll angular velocity, and a roll angular acceleration of the chassis 6 of the vehicle body 1.  The
posture sensor 2 can detect, for example, the pitch angle (inclination angle) of the chassis 6 caused by forward and backward movement of the center of gravity of the passenger.  The posture sensor 2 can also detect the roll angle (inclination angle) of
division steps 9L, 9R of the chassis 6 caused by left and right movement of the center of gravity of the passenger.
 The posture sensor 2 is connected to the control device 5.  The posture sensor 2 outputs the detected posture information to the control device 5.  Note that the posture sensor 2 includes, for example, a gyroscopic sensor, an acceleration
sensor, and an angular sensor.  A pitch axis is an axis corresponding to an axle of a pair of wheels 7L, 7R.  A roll axis is an axis which passes through the center of the chassis 6 and is parallel to the traveling direction of the vehicle body 1.
 The rotation sensor 3 detects rotation information such as a rotation angle, a rotation velocity, and a rotation acceleration of the wheels 7L, 7R provided at the vehicle body 1.  The rotation sensor 3 is connected to the control device 5.  The
rotation sensor 3 outputs the detected rotation information to the control device 5.
 The pair of wheel drive units 4L, 4R are a concrete example of drive means, and allow the vehicle body 1 to travel by driving the pair of wheels 7L, 7R which are rotatably provided at the vehicle body 1.  Each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R
includes, for example, an electrical motor, and a reduction gear.  The reduction gear is coupled to the rotation axis of the electrical motor, and can transmit the power of the electrical motor to the wheels 7L, 7R.  Each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R
is connected to the control device 5 through drive circuits 8L, 8R.  The wheel drive units 4L, 4R drive the wheels 7L, 7R, respectively, in response to a control signal from the control device 5.
 The control device 5 controls the rotation of each of the wheels 7L, 7R by controlling each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R so that the vehicle body 1 performs the desired traveling (moving forward, moving backward, accelerating, decelerating,
stopping, turning left, turning right, or the like) under the inverted pendulum control to maintain the inverted state.  Further, the control device 5 performs the well-known control such as a feedback control or a robust control, based on the posture
information of the vehicle body 1 detected by the posture sensor 2 and the rotation information of each of the wheels 7L, 7R detected by the rotation sensor 3.
 For example, the control device 5 moves the vehicle body 1 forward and backward by controlling the rotation of each of the wheels 7L, 7R through each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R, according to the pitch angle of the chassis 6 detected by the
posture sensor 2 when the passenger moves the center of gravity forward and backward.  Further, the control device 5 allows the vehicle body 1 to turn left and right by controlling each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R to produce the rotational difference
between the left and right wheels 7L, 7R, according to the roll angle of the division steps 9L, 9R of the chassis 6 detected by the posture sensor 2 when the passenger moves the center of gravity left and right.
 Furthermore, the control device 5 calculates, for example, rotation torque of each of the wheels 7L, 7R by multiplying the pitch angle of the chassis 6 detected by the posture sensor 2 by a predetermined control gain.  Then, the control device 5
controls each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R so that the calculated rotation torque occurs in each of the wheels 7L, 7R.  As a result, the control device 5 performs the inverted pendulum control so that the center of gravity of the vehicle body 1
returns onto the vertical line which passes though the axle of each of the wheels 7L, 7R, by rotating each of the wheels 7L, 7R in a direction in which the chassis 6 is inclined.  Further, the control device 5 can maintain the inverted state in which the
pitch angle does not exceed a certain value by adding the adequate rotation torque to each of the wheels 7L, 7R, and control the movement of the vehicle body 1 such as moving forward, moving backward, stopping, decelerating, accelerating, turning left,
or turning right, according to the posture angle from the posture sensor 2.
 The above-mentioned configuration of the vehicle control allows the vehicle body 1 to move forward and backward by movement of the center of gravity of the passenger forward and backward to incline the chassis 6 forward and backward, and allows
the vehicle body 1 to turn left and right by movement of the center of gravity of the passenger left and right to incline the chassis 6 left and right, for example.
 Note that the control device 5 may be implemented by hardware with a microcomputer as a center, for example, and the microcomputer includes a CPU (Central Processing Unit) 5a for performing control processing, arithmetic processing, or the like,
a ROM (Read Only Memory) 5b for storing a control program, a calculation program, or the like executed by the CPU 5a, and a RAM (Random Access Memory) 5c for temporarily storing processed data or the like.
 The step sensors 16L, 16R are respectively provided at the pair of division steps 9L, 9R.  Each of the step sensors 16L, 16R includes a load sensor which can detect the load of the passenger on each of the division steps 9L, 9R.  Each of step
sensors 16L, 16R outputs the detected load to the control device 5.  The control device 5 can detect a state in which only one foot of the passenger is placed on one of the division steps 9L, 9R, a state in which both feet of the passenger are placed on
the pair of division steps 9L, 9R, and a state in which neither foot of the passenger is placed on the division steps 9L, 9R.
 The vehicle body 1 is, as shown in FIG. 2, configured as a coaxial two-wheel vehicle.  The vehicle body 1 includes the chassis 6, the wheels 7L, 7R, the division steps 9L, 9R, and a handle 11.  The pair of left and right division steps 9L, 9R
are one example of step plates on which the passenger gets.  The chassis 6 supports each of the division steps 9L, 9R in such a manner as to allow the posture thereof to be changed in a roll direction.  The pair of left and right wheels 7L, 7R are
rotatably supported by the chassis 6.  The handle 11 is an operation lever to alter the posture of each of the division steps 9L, 9R in a roll direction through the chassis 6.
 The division steps 9L, 9R on which the feet of the passenger are respectively placed, is composed of a pair of flat plate bodies.  Each of the plate bodies is formed in approximately the same size as the foot of a human or formed in a little
larger size than the foot of a human.  The chassis 6 is constructed as a parallel link mechanism which includes a vehicle body upper member 12, a vehicle body lower member 13, and a pair of side members 14L, 14R.  The vehicle body upper member 12 and the
vehicle body lower member 13 are arranged vertically and in parallel to each other.  The pair of side members 14L, 14R are arranged horizontally, in parallel to each other, and rotatably coupled to the vehicle body upper member 12 and the vehicle body
lower member 13.
 A pair of coil springs 15L, 15R are interposed between the vehicle body upper member 12 and the vehicle body lower member 13 of the parallel link mechanism.  The pair of coil springs 15L, 15R produce a spring force so that the angle between each
of the vehicle body upper member 12 and the vehicle body lower member 13, and each of the pair of side members 14L, 14R is maintained at a right angle.  Further, the wheel drive units 4L, 4R are respectively mounted on the outer faces of the pair of side
members 14L, 14R.  Thus, when the pair of wheels 7L, 7R supported by the pair of side members 14L, 14R through the pair of wheel drive units 4L, 4R are placed on a flat road surface, the rotation centers of the pair of wheels 7L, 7R coincide with each
other on the same axis line.  Note that the vehicle body 1 is structured as a coaxial two-wheel vehicle, however, the structure of the vehicle body 1 is not limited thereto.  For example, the vehicle body 1 is applicable to an arbitrary vehicle which is
operated by the movement of the center of gravity of a passenger and performs the inverted pendulum control.
 Now then, when a passenger rides on the vehicle body, for example, the passenger operates a handle forward and backward, or inclines the vehicle body forward and backward without intention so that, in a response to the movement, the vehicle body
moves forward and backward.  Consequently, it can be difficult for the passenger to ride on the vehicle body.
 Therefore, when the control device 5 according to the present embodiment detects a start of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger, the control device 5 performs the inverted pendulum control and a position control to continually return
the vehicle body 1 to a position where the passenger can safely and easily ride on the vehicle body 1.  The position is, for example, a position X1 where the passenger starts riding on the vehicle body 1 (the position X1 is hereinafter referred to as
""riding start position X1"").
 Accordingly, when the passenger, for example, rides on the vehicle body 1, the passenger operates the handle 11 forward and backward, or inclines the vehicle body 1 forward and backward so that, in response to the movement, the vehicle body 1
moves forward and backward.  Even if such a case occurs, the vehicle body 1 can be returned to the riding start position X1 by the above-mentioned position control.  As a result, a space between the vehicle body 1 and the passenger is suitably maintained
when the passenger rides on the vehicle body 1.  Therefore, the passenger can safely and easily ride on the vehicle body 1.
 FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a schematic system configuration of a control device.  The control device 5 includes a riding detection portion 51, a command generation portion 52, and a control portion 53.  The riding detection portion 51
detects the start of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger.  The command generation portion 52 generates a torque command value.  The control portion 53 controls each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R based on the torque command value generated by
the command generation portion 52.
 The riding detection portion 51 detects the start of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger, by detecting, for example, the state in which only one foot of the passenger gets on one of the division steps 9L, 9R based on the load detected
by each of the step sensors 16L, 16R.  When the riding detection portion 51 detects the start of the passenger riding on the vehicle body 1, the riding detection portion 51 outputs a start signal to the command generation portion 52.
 Further, the riding detection portion 51 detects the completion of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger, by detecting, for example, the state in which both feet of the passenger are respectively placed on the pair of division steps 9L,
9R based on the load detected by each of the step sensors 16L, 16R.  When the riding detection portion 51 detects the completion of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger, the riding detection portion 51 outputs a completion signal to the command
generation portion 52.
 The command generation portion 52 generates the torque command value to control each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R, and outputs the generated torque command value to the control portion 53.  Further, when the command generation portion 52
receives the start signal from the riding detection portion 51, the command generation portion 52 generates the torque command value to perform the inverted pendulum control and continually return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1
obtained when the start signal is received.
 Herein, the command generation portion 52 calculates the torque command value by using, for example, the following expression (1).  Note that in the following expression (1), .beta.  denotes the pitch angle of the chassis 6 detected by the
posture sensor 2, .beta.' denotes the pitch angular velocity, x denotes the vehicle position of the vehicle body 1, x' denotes the velocity of the vehicle body 1, K.sub.pp, denotes a pitch angle gain, K.sub.pd denotes a pitch angular velocity gain,
K.sub.px denotes a vehicle position gain, and K.sub.dx denotes a velocity gain.  Further, the parameters to which a subscript r is attached denote the command values, while the parameters to which the subscript r is not attached denote the detected
values.  Furthermore, .beta..sub.r' is equal to 0, x.sub.r denotes the riding start position X1 where the passenger starts the riding motion, and x.sub.r' is equal to 0.  The torque command
value=K.sub.pp(.beta..sub.r-.beta.)+K.sub.dp(.beta..sub.r'-.beta.')+K.sub- .px(x.sub.r-x)+K.sub.dx(x.sub.r'-x')(1)
 Note that the command generation portion 52 can calculate the vehicle position x and velocity x' of the vehicle body 1 based on the rotation information of the wheels 7L, 7R detected by the rotation sensor 3.
 Furthermore, when the command generation portion 52 receives the completion signal from the riding detection portion 51, the command generation portion 52 suspends the position control and generates the torque command value to maintain the
inverted pendulum control.  Herein, the command generation portion 52 generates the torque command value by using, for example, the following expression (2).  Further, the command generation portion 52, for example, generates the torque command value to
suspend a turning control and to perform the only forward/backward movement control until the command generation portion 52 receives the completion signal from the riding detection portion 51 and the passenger completes riding, in view of safety and ride
performance.  The torque command value=K.sub.pp(.beta..sub.r-.beta.)+K.sub.dp(.beta..sub.r'-.beta.- ')(2)
 The control portion 52 controls each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R and controls driving of each of the wheels 7L, 7R, by sending a control signal to each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R, according to the torque command value generated by the
command generation portion 52.
 Next, a control method for the traveling apparatus 10 according to the present embodiment is explained in detail.  FIG. 4 is a flowchart showing an exemplary control processing flow of the traveling apparatus according to the present embodiment.
 When the passenger starts riding on the vehicle body 1, the passenger, as shown in FIG. 5B, places one foot on one of the division steps 9L, 9R, from the state in which the passenger, as shown in FIG. 5A, grips the handle 11 and holds the
vehicle body 1.  At that time, the riding detection portion 51 detects the state in which only one foot of the passenger is placed on one of the division steps 9L, 9R, and detects the start of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger, based on the
load detected by each of the step sensors 16L, 16R (step S101).
 When the riding detection portion 51 detects the start of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger (YES in step S101), and decides that, as shown in FIG. 5C, the chassis 6 becomes the riding posture in which the chassis 6 is in a horizontal
state (YES in step S102), the riding detection portion 51 outputs the start signal to the command generation portion 52.  Note that when the riding detection portion 51 detects the start of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger, the riding
detection portion 51 may directly output the start signal to the command generation portion 52 without deciding the above-mentioned riding posture.
 The command generation portion 52 generates the torque command value by using the aforementioned expression (1) (step S103), and outputs the generated torque command value to the control portion 53.  The control portion 53 performs the inverted
pendulum control and the position control to continually return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1 through each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R, based on the torque command value generated by the command generation portion 52 (step S104).
 For example, as shown in FIG. 5D, when the vehicle position of the vehicle body 1 moves in front of the riding start position X1 and the vehicle body 1 is away from the passenger, the control portion 53 controls each of the wheel drive units 4L,
4R for the vehicle body 1 to approach the passenger, by moving the vehicle body 1 backward to return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1.  Consequently, the passenger can safely and easily ride on the chassis 6 in comfortable posture.
 Meanwhile, as shown in FIG. 5E, when the vehicle position of the vehicle body 1 moves behind the riding start position X1 and the vehicle body 1 comes closer to the passenger, the control portion 53 controls each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R
to cause the vehicle body 1 to move a little away from the passenger, by moving the vehicle body 1 forward to return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1.  Consequently, the passenger can maintain an adequate distance from the chassis 6,
and safely and easily ride on the chassis 6.
 The riding detection portion 51 detects, as shown in FIG. 5F, the completion of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger, by detecting the state in which the both feet of the passenger are respectively placed on the pair of division steps
9L, 9R based on the load detected by each of the step sensors 16L, 16R (step S105).  When the riding detection portion 51 detects the completion of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger (YES in step S105), the riding detection portion outputs the
completion signal to the command generation portion 52.
 When the command generation portion 52 receives the completion signal from the riding detection portion 51, the command generation portion 52 generates the torque command value by using the aforementioned expression (2), and outputs the torque
command value to the control portion 53.  The control portion 53 controls each of the wheel drive units 4L, 4R to suspend the position control and maintain the inverted pendulum control, based on the torque command value generated by the command
generation portion 52 (step S106).
 As stated above, in the traveling apparatus 10 according to the present embodiment, when the control device 5 detects the start of riding on the vehicle body 1 by the passenger, the control device 5 performs the inverted pendulum control and the
position control to continually return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1.  Consequently, even when the vehicle body 1 gets out of position due to unintentional traveling operations or the like of the passenger, the vehicle body 1 can be
returned to the riding start position X1 where the passenger can safely and easily ride by the aforementioned position control.  Therefore, the passenger can safely and easily ride on the vehicle body 1.
 Note that the present invention is not limited to the above exemplary embodiments and can be modified in various manners without departing from the scope of the present invention.  For example, while, in the above exemplary embodiment, the
command generation portion 52 generates the torque command value to continually return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1, the present invention is not limited thereto.  The command generation portion 52 may generate the torque command
value corresponding to the pitch angle (target posture) of the chassis 6 to return the vehicle body 1 to the position where the passenger can safely and easily ride.
 For example, as shown in FIG. 5D, when the vehicle position of the vehicle body 1 moves in front of the riding start position X1 and the distance between the passenger and the vehicle body 1 becomes large, the command generation portion 52
generates the torque command value to incline the chassis 6 backward according to the distance.  Then, the control portion 53 controls the vehicle body 1 to move backward to return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1 and approaches the
vehicle body 1 to the passenger, based on the pitch angle corresponding to the backward inclination of the chassis 6 detected by the posture sensor 2.
 On the other, as shown in FIG. 5E, when the vehicle position of the vehicle body 1 moves behind the riding start position X1 and the distance between the passenger and the vehicle body 1 becomes small, the command generation portion 52 generates
the torque command value to incline the chassis 6 forward according to the distance.  Then, the control portion 53 controls the vehicle body 1 to move forward to return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1 and causes the vehicle body 1 to
move away from the passenger, based on the pitch angle corresponding to the forward inclination of the chassis 6 detected by the posture sensor 2.
 Note that the command generation portion 52 calculates the torque command value by using the aforementioned expression (2).  At that time, in the case where an expression x.sub.r.ltoreq.x is applied, an expression
.beta..sub.r=K.sub.xf(x.sub.r-x) is applied.  In case where an expression x.sub.r>x is applied, an expression .beta..sub.r=K.sub.xb(x.sub.r-x) is applied.  Further, K.sub.xf denotes a frontside position error conversion coefficient, and K.sub.xb
denotes a backside position error conversion coefficient.
 When the command generation portion 52 receives the completion signal from the riding detection portion 51, the command generation portion 52 generates the torque command value corresponding to the pitch angle at the start of riding, and outputs
the torque command value to the control portion 53.
 Further, while, in the above exemplary embodiment, when the command generation portion 52 receives the start signal from the riding detection portion 51, the command generation portion 52 generates the torque command value to perform the
inverted pendulum control and continually return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1, the present invention is not limited thereto.  The command generation portion 52 may generate the torque command value to perform the inverted pendulum
control and maintain a predetermined distance between the chassis 6 and the passenger.  Note that the distance between the chassis 6 and the passenger (e.g., a landing foot, or a body) can be detected by a distance sensor (e.g., a camera, an ultra-sonic
sensor, or a radar sensor) provided at the chassis 6, or the like.  Consequently, when the passenger gets on the chassis 6 of the vehicle body 1, the distance between the chassis 6 and the passenger can be maintained the predetermined distance suitable
for the riding.  Therefore, the passenger can safely and easily ride on the vehicle body 1.
 Furthermore, while, in the above exemplary embodiment, the control portion 53 performs the position control to return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1 by moving the vehicle body 1 forward and backward, the present invention is
not limited thereto.  The control portion 53 may perform the position control to return the vehicle body 1 to the riding start position X1 by turning the vehicle body 1 left and right, and may perform the position control to return the vehicle body 1 to
the riding start position X1 by moving the vehicle body 1 forward and backward as well as turning the vehicle body 1 left and right.
 While, in the above exemplary embodiment, the description has been made of an example where the present invention is implemented by hardware, the present invention is not limited thereto.  The present invention can also be implemented by causing
the CPU 5a to execute the processing shown in FIG. 4 as a computer program.  In this case, the computer program can be stored and provided to a computer using any type of non-transitory computer readable media.  Non-transitory computer readable media
include any type of tangible storage media.  Examples of non-transitory computer readable media include magnetic storage media (floppy disks, magnetic tapes, hard disk drives, etc.), optical magnetic storage media (e.g. magneto-optical disks), CD-ROM
(compact disc read only memory), CD-R (compact disc recordable), CD-R/W (compact disc rewritable), and semiconductor memories (mask ROM, PROM (programmable ROM), EPROM (erasable PROM), flash ROM, RAM (random access memory), etc.).  The program may be
provided to a computer using any type of transitory computer readable media.  Examples of transitory computer readable media include electric signals, optical signals, and electromagnetic waves.  Transitory computer readable media can provide the program
to a computer via a wired communication line (e.g. electric wires and optical fibers) or a wireless communication line.
 From the invention thus described, it will be obvious that the embodiments of the invention may be varied in many ways.  Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications
as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended for inclusion within the scope of the following claims.

",,"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
 This application is based on and claims priority under 35 U.S.C.  .sctn.119 to Japanese Patent Application 2010-212550, filed on Sep. 22, 2010, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
 This disclosure relates to a seat apparatus for a vehicle, which includes a load detection device detecting a load applied to a vehicle seat.
BACKGROUND DISCUSSION
 A known seat apparatus for a vehicle includes a seat adjustment device adjusting a position of a vehicle seat on which an occupant sits, and a load detection device detecting a load applied to the vehicle seat.  A detection result by the load
detection device is utilized in a control device for determining whether or not an occupant safety protection device is driven or whether or not the occupant is seated on the vehicle seat.  The seat apparatus configured as described above is disclosed,
for example, in JP2008-32479A (hereinafter referred to as Reference 1) or JP2001-150997A (hereinafter referred to as Reference 2, refer to a fourth embodiment and FIG. 4).  The seat apparatus according to Reference 1 includes a pair of slide rails (upper
rails) arranged in a lateral direction of the vehicle and sliding along a longitudinal direction of the vehicle, and load detection devices arranged between each of the slide rails and each of a pair of brackets arranged at respective upper sides of the
slide rails along the longitudinal direction to support the vehicle seat.  In particular, according to the seat apparatus described in Reference 1, the load detection devices are arranged at four portions that are attachment portions located at
respective front and rear end portions of the slide rails arranged in the lateral direction of the vehicle.
 According to the seat apparatus according to Reference 2, the number of load detection devices is lower than the number of load detection devices applied in the seat apparatus according to Reference 1 in order to reduce manufacturing,
assembling, and wiring costs.  The load detection devices are arranged at two portions that are respective attachment portions located between each of rear end portions of a pair of slide rails and each of a pair of brackets in the lateral direction. 
The bracket and a front end portion of the slide rail are fixed to each other by spot welding and the like.
 The magnitude or direction of the load applied to the vehicle seat vary depending on an orientation of the vehicle, an orientation of the occupant, a seated position of the occupant on the vehicle seat, and the like.  Accordingly, a load acts on
each of the load detection devices in a direction different from a load detecting direction; therefore errors may be included in a detection value of the load detection device.  According to the seat apparatus described in Reference 1, the vehicle seat
and the slide rails are fixed to one another by the brackets.  In addition, each of the brackets is configured to connect the fixed portion positioned at front side of the slide rail to the fixed portion at a rear side of the slide rail.  Accordingly,
when the magnitude or direction of the load applied to the vehicle seat varies, only a vertical component of force of the applied load relative to a vehicle floor acts on the load detection device.  As a result, the errors in the detection value may be
reduced.
 In addition, for example, the slide rail or a frame that constitutes a portion of the vehicle seat may be deformed depending on the variations of the magnitude or direction of the applied load or depending on an adjusted position of the vehicle
seat.  At this time, a load acting in a direction to detach the bracket from the slide rail or in a direction to press the bracket against the slide rail may be applied to the fixed portion of the front or rear side of the vehicle seat (slide rail).  The
load due to the deformation of the slide rail or the frame may be transmitted to the load detection device by the bracket and therefore acts on the load detection device.
 Here, in the seat apparatus described in Reference 1, the load applied to the vehicle seat is detected based on a sum total of detection values of the load detection devices arranged at the aforementioned four portions.  Accordingly, even when
the load due to the deformation of the slide rail or the frame is applied to the fixed portion of the front or rear side of the vehicle seat, variations of the loads acting on the load detection devices are compensated for one another, therefore
minimizing influences of the variations on a detection result by the load detection devices.  Meanwhile, in the seat apparatus described in Reference 2, the load detection devices are arranged only at the aforementioned two portions.  Accordingly,
variations of loads acting on the respective load detection devices due to the deformation of the slide rail or the frame may not be compensated for one another.  Consequently, errors may be included in the sum total of the detection values of the load
detection devices.
 A need thus exists for a seat apparatus for a vehicle, which is not susceptible to the drawback mentioned above.
SUMMARY
 According to an aspect of this disclosure, a seat apparatus for a vehicle includes a slide rail arranged slidably relative to a vehicle floor in a longitudinal direction, a bracket including a first end portion fixed to the slide rail, a second
end portion, and a connecting portion connecting the first end portion to the second end portion, a vehicle seat supported by the bracket, and a load detection device arranged between the slide rail and the second end portion of the bracket and detecting
a load applied to the vehicle seat, wherein rigidity of the connecting portion of the bracket in a vertical direction of the vehicle is set to be lower than rigidities of the first end portion and the second end portion of the bracket in the vertical
direction. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 A seat apparatus according to an embodiment of this disclosure will be described with reference to illustrations of the drawing figures as follows.  Hereinafter, a direction of an occupant seated at a seat apparatus 1 according to the embodiment
will be defined as a front side of the vehicle for ease of explanation, that is, a longitudinal direction (the front side and a rear side), a lateral direction (right and left sides), and a vertical direction (upper and lower sides) of the seat apparatus
1 correspond to those of the vehicle.
 (Configuration of the seat apparatus) As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the seat apparatus 1 mainly includes a vehicle seat 10, a slide mechanism 20, a pair of brackets 30, load detection devices 40, and a lift mechanism 50.  A vehicle floor 2 to
which the seat apparatus 1 is fixed serves as a floor of the vehicle (the vehicle floor 2 will be hereinafter referred to as a floor 2).
 The vehicle seat 10 mounted on the vehicle serves as a seat for the occupant (the vehicle seat 10 will be hereinafter referred to as a seat 10).  As illustrated in FIG. 1, the seat 10 mainly includes a seat cushion 11, a seat back 12, a head
rest 13, and seat frames 14.  The seat cushion 11 serves as a seating portion on which the occupant sits.  The seat back 12 corresponds to a back rest attached to a rear end portion of the seat cushion 11 and tiltable in the longitudinal direction.  The
head rest 13 is arranged at an upper end of the seat back 12 while supporting the head of the occupant.  The seat frames 14 are arranged at a lower side of the seat cushion 11 at predetermined intervals from each other in the lateral direction.  The seat
10 is fixedly supported relative to the brackets 30 by the seat frames 14 in a condition where the lift mechanism 50 that will be described below is arranged between the brackets 30 and the seat 10 in the vertical direction.  First and second attachment
bores 14a and 14b are formed in each of the seat frames 14.  First and second links 51 and 52 of the lift mechanism 50 are connected to the first attachment bore 14a and the second attachment bore 14b, respectively.
 The slide mechanism 20 serves as a base supporting the seat 10 relative to the floor 2 and adjusting a position of the seat 10 in the longitudinal direction.  As illustrated in FIG. 1, the slide mechanism 20 mainly includes a pair of lower rails
21 and a pair of upper rails 22 (slide rails).  The lower rails 21 extending in the longitudinal direction are positioned at a lower side of the slide mechanism 20.  The lower rails 21 are fixed to the floor 2 by fixing members so as to keep a
predetermined distance from each other in the lateral direction.
 The upper rails 22 extending in the longitudinal direction are positioned at an upper side of the slide mechanism 20.  The pair of upper rails 22 attached to the pair of lower rails 21 is arranged slidably relative to the floor 2 along the
longitudinal direction.  In addition, a relative slide movement between the lower rails 21 and the upper rails 22 is switchable between locked and unlocked states by a lock/unlock mechanism.  Thus, the slide mechanism 20 may fix the upper rails 22
relative to the floor 2 so that the upper rails 22 are positioned desirably or selectively by the occupant; therefore, the position of the seat 10 supported by the upper rails 22 is adjustable in the longitudinal direction.
 The brackets 30 support the seat 10 in a condition where the lift mechanism 50 is arranged between the brackets 30 and the seat 10 in the vertical direction.  The pair of brackets 30 is fixed to respective front end portions of the pair of upper
rails 2.  Further, the pair of brackets 30 is supported by respective rear end portions of the pair of upper rails 22 in a condition where each of the load detection devices 40 is sandwiched between each of the brackets 30 and each of the upper rails 22
in the vertical direction.  In particular, the seat 10 is fixed or supported by attachment portions located at the front and rear end portions of each of the upper rails 2.  As illustrated in FIGS. 2 to 4, the bracket 30 includes a front end portion 31,
a rear end portion 32, and a connecting portion 33.
 The front end portion 31 includes a flat surface portion contacting a ceiling plate of the upper rail 22.  The flat surface portion of the front end portion 31 is directly fixed to the upper rail 22 by a fixing member such as a bolt.  The front
end portion 31 serves as a first end portion.  The rear end portion 32 includes a flat surface portion having a length in the longitudinal direction, which is the same size as a length of the load detection device 40 in the longitudinal direction.  The
flat surface portion of the rear end portion 32 is indirectly supported by the upper rail 22 in a condition where the load detection device 40 is sandwiched between the upper rail 22 and the bracket 30.  The rear end portion 32 serves as a second end
portion positioned rearward relative to the first end portion in the longitudinal direction.  The connecting portion 33 includes a flat surface portion extending between the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32.  The flat surface portion of
the connecting portion 33 connects the front end portion 31 to the rear end portion 32 to connect the attachment portion of the front portion of the upper rail 22 to the attachment portion of the rear end portion of the upper rail 22.
 Further, first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a continuously formed with one another are arranged at a portion of a peripheral side edge of each of the brackets 30 in the lateral direction so as to extend upward along the
longitudinal direction.  As illustrated in FIG. 3, a first attachment bore 31b to which the first link 51 of the lift mechanism 50 is attached is formed in the first flange 31a while a second attachment bore 32b to which the second link 52 of the lift
mechanism 50 is attached is formed in the second flange 32a.  Moreover, as shown in FIG. 4, the first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a are formed in a uniform thickness (see FIG. 4).  One of side surfaces of the bracket 30 in the lateral
direction is a flat surface.  As described above, the pair of brackets 30 supports the seat 10 in a condition where the lift mechanism 50 is sandwiched between the brackets 30 and the seat 10 in the vertical direction and each of the brackets 30 is fixed
or supported by the attachment portions of the front and rear end portions of the upper rail 22.  In addition, as described above, the first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a of the bracket 30 are formed at the peripheral side edge so as to
extend upward along the longitudinal direction.  Alternatively, the first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a of the bracket 30 may be formed at the peripheral side edge so as to extend downward along the longitudinal direction.
 In addition, flexural rigidity of the connecting portion 33 of the bracket 30 in the vertical direction is set to be lower than flexural rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32 in the vertical direction.  The flexural
rigidities of the front end portion 31, the rear end portion 32, and the connecting portion 33 are set as described above in order to improve detection accuracy of the load detection device 40 for a load applied to the seat 10.  The load detection device
40 will be described in further detail below.
 The load detection device 40 is a load detection means arranged between the upper rail 22 and the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30 and detecting the load applied to the seat 10.  In particular, the load detection devices 40 are arranged at
two portions that are located at the respective rear end portions of the pair of upper rails 22.  The load detection devices 40 support the brackets 30 relative to the upper rails 22, respectively.  That is, the load detection devices 40 are attached to
the respective rear end portions of the upper rails 22 and to the respective rear end portions 32 of the brackets 30.  In other words, the seat 10 is supported by the brackets 30 in a condition where the lift mechanism 50 is arranged between the seat 10
and the brackets 30 in the vertical direction.  In addition, the seat 10 is arranged so that two corners at respective rear ends of lower surfaces of the seat frames 14 are supported by the upper rails 22.
 The load detection device 40 mainly includes a load input portion 41 and a base portion 42.  The load input portion 41 makes contact with the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30 to receive the load applied to the seat 10 via the bracket 30;
therefore, the load is inputted to the load detection device 40.  Thus, the load detection device 40 detects the load in accordance with an amount of deformation of an flexure element made of metal.  In particular, in a case where the load detection
device 40 utilizes a strain gauge having an electric resistance varying depending on an amount of deformation of a metallic member included in the strain gauge and a load is applied to the metallic member, the load detection device 40 outputs a signal
for detecting the amount of deformation of the metallic member.  The load detection device 40 is configured to detect the minute deformation of the metallic member serving as the flexure element where an internal stress is generated by the applied load. 
The base portion 42 includes, for example, through holes; thereby, the load detection device 40 is fixed to the upper rail 22 by fixing members such as bolts inserted in the through holes.  According to the embodiment, two bolts inserted in the through
holes and penetrating through the ceiling plate of the upper rail 22 and the base portion 42, are tightened with two nuts arranged at an upper side of the base portion 42, thereby fixing the load detection device 40 to the upper rail 22.
 The lift mechanism 50 is arranged between the seat 10 and the brackets 30 in the vertical direction.  The lift mechanism 50 moves the seat 10 upward and downward relative to the floor 2.  The lift mechanism 50 mainly includes the first links 50,
the second links 52, a motor 53, a speed reduction device 54, and a pinion gear 55.  Each of the first links 51 is rotatably connected to the first attachment bore 14a formed in the seat frame 14 and to the first attachment bore 31b formed in the first
flange 31a of the bracket 30.  Each of the second links 52 is rotatably connected to the second attachment bore 14b formed in the seat frame 14 and to the second attachment bore 32b of the second flange 32a of the bracket 30.  A sector gear 52a having
external teeth formed in an outer circular arc is formed at the sector link 52.  The external teeth of the sector gear 52a engage with the pinion gear 55.
 The motor 53 is arranged at a lower side of the seat frame 14.  The motor 53 serves as an electric motor rotating in normal and reverse directions in accordance with the volume of power supplied to the electric motor.  The speed reduction device
54 connected to an output shaft of the motor 53 reduces the number of rotations of the motor 53.  The speed reduction device 54 transmits a driving force of the motor 53 to the pinion gear 55 by means of a worm gear.  The worm gear of the speed reduction
device 54 includes a self lock function by which torque inputted from the pinion gear 55 is not transmitted to the motor 53.  Accordingly, only when the driving force of the motor 53 is transmitted to the speed reduction device 54, the pinion gear 55
rotates.  The pinion gear 55 is fixed to an end portion of a rotation shaft of the speed reduction device 54.  The pinion gear 55 engages with the sector gear 52a of the second link 52.
 The lift mechanism 50 configured as described above moves the seat 10 upward and downward relative to the floor 2 while the rotation of the motor 53 is controlled by the speed reduction device 54.  In particular, the motor 53 rotates and a
rotation speed of the motor 53, which is reduced by the speed reduction device 54, is transmitted to the pinion gear 55.  Then, the driving force of the motor 53 is transmitted to the sector gear 52a engaging with the pinion gear 55.  Accordingly, the
first link 51 and the second link 52 rotate relative to the seat frame 14 and the bracket 30.  Here, the second links 52 connected via the second attachment bores 32b to the pair of brackets 30 fixed at right and left sides of the upper rails 22 in the
lateral direction are connected to the seat frames 14 by a rotating force transmitting member that penetrates through the second attachment bores 14b of the seat frames 14 in the lateral direction.  Consequently, one of the second links 52 at the right
and left sides of the upper rails 22 rotates and the rotating force is transmitted to the other of the second links 52 by the rotating force transmitting member.  Then, the other of the second links 52 is rotated along with the one of the second links
52.  As a result, as illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B, the seat 10 is moved upward and downward in accordance with an operation of the lift mechanism 50.
 (Configuration of the bracket) As described above, the connecting portion 33 connects the front end portion 31 to the rear end portion 32, thereby connecting the attachment portions of the front and rear end portions of the upper rail 22 to each
other in order to improve the detection accuracy of the load detection device 40 arranged between the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30 and the upper rail 22 in the vertical direction.  In the seat apparatus 1, the load detection devices 40 are
arranged only at the respective rear end portions of the upper rails 22 in the lateral direction.  Such arrangement of the load detection devices 40 may be inferior in the detection accuracy to a case where the load detection devices 40 are arranged at
the respective front and rear end portions of the upper rails 22 in the lateral direction.
 In particular, when the seat 10 is moved upward and downward by the operation of the lift mechanism 50, connecting angles of the first link 51 and the second link 52 of the lift mechanism 50 relative to the bracket 30 vary.  For example, when
the seat cushion 11 is in a lowest position as illustrated in FIG. 5A, an angle L.alpha.  formed by the first link 51 attached to the first attachment bore 31b is defined as the connecting angle L.alpha.  of the first link 51 relative to the bracket 30
and an angle L.beta.  formed by the second link 52 attached to the second attachment bore 32b and the horizontal surface is defined as the connecting angle L.beta.  of the second link 52 relative to the bracket 30.  Further, when the seat cushion 11 is
in a highest position as illustrated in FIG. 5B, an angle H.alpha.  formed by the first link 51 attached to the first attachment bore 31b and a horizontal surface is defined as the connecting angle H.alpha.  of the first link 51 relative to the bracket
30 and an angle H.beta.  formed by the second link 52 attached to the second attachment bore 32b and the horizontal surface is defined as the connecting angle H.beta.  of the second link 52 relative to the bracket 30.  The connecting angle H.alpha.  of
the first link 51 relative to the bracket 30 is larger than the connecting angle L.alpha.  of the first link 51 relative to the bracket 30 (L.alpha.<H.alpha.).  Meanwhile, the connecting angle H.beta.  of the second link 52 relative to the bracket 30
is larger than the connecting angle L.beta.  of the second link 52 relative to the bracket 30 (L.beta.<H.beta.).
 In other words, when the seat cushion 11 of the seat 10 is in the lowest position shown in FIG. 5A and the highest position shown FIG. 5B, directions in which the first attachment bore 31b and the second attachment bore 32b receive the load of
the seat 10 (including a load of the occupant) from the first link 51 and the second link 52, respectively, are different from one another.  As described above, the bracket 30 includes the connecting portion 33 connecting the front end portion 31 that is
fixed to the upper rail 22, to the rear end portion 32 that supports the load detection device 40 in a condition where the load detection device 40 is arranged between the bracket 30 and the upper rail 22.  Accordingly, a vertical component of force of
the load of the seat 10 is appropriately inputted to the load detection device 40.  Consequently, even when the directions in which the bracket 30 receives the load of the seat 10 vary in accordance with the operation of the lift mechanism 50, the load
detection devices 40 arranged at the respective rear end portions of the upper rails 22 in the lateral direction may surely detect the load of the occupant seated on the seat 10.
 According to the seat apparatus 1 of the embodiment, the seat frame 14 or the upper rail 22 may be deformed depending on variations of the magnitude or direction of the load applied to the seat 10 and depending on an adjusted position of the
seat 10 by the slide mechanism 20.  Accordingly, a load due to the deformation of the seat frame 14 or the upper rail 22 may be applied to the bracket 30 connecting the attachment portions of the front and rear end portions of the upper rail 22 to each
other because a stress generated within the bracket 30 due to different deformation patterns of the seat frame 14 and the upper rail 22 is transmitted to the load detection device 40 via the connecting portion 33 of the bracket 30.  Thus, the load due to
the deformation of the seat frame 14 to which the bracket 30 is fixed or the upper rail 22 to which the bracket 30 is fixed causes deterioration of the detection accuracy of the load detection device 40.
 As described above, according to the seat apparatus 1 of the embodiment, the bracket 30 is configured so that the flexural rigidity of the connecting portion 33 in the vertical direction is lower than the flexural rigidities of the front end
portion 31 and the rear end portion 32 in the vertical direction.  The load due to the deformation of the seat frame 14 or the upper rail 22 acts in a direction to detach the bracket 30 from the upper rail 22 or in a direction to press the bracket 30
against the upper rail 22, i.e., the load due to the deformation of the seat frame 14 or the upper rail 22 acts in the vertical direction.  Accordingly, when the seat frame 14 or the upper rail 22 is deformed, the bracket 30 may be deformed so as to
allow the deformation of the seat frame 14 or the upper rail 22.  In particular, even when the deformation patterns of the seat frame 14 and the upper rail 22 that support therebetween the bracket 30 are different from each other, the connecting portion
33 is deformed so as to allow a difference between an amount of deformation of the seat frame 14 and an amount of deformation of the upper rail 22.  Consequently, the load due to the deformation of the seat frame 14 or the upper rail 22 is refrained from
acting on the load detection device 40.
 In addition, the front end portion 31 serving as the first end portion of the bracket 30 is fixed to the upper rail 22; therefore, the upper rail 22 may be deformed relative to the front end portion 31 of the bracket 30.  Accordingly, in a case
where the flexural rigidity is high at portions of the bracket 30, a stress generated within the bracket 30 due to the deformation of the upper rail 22 relative to the bracket 30 may act on the load detection device 40 via the rear end portion 32 serving
as the second end portion of the bracket 30.  Consequently, the bracket 30 is configured to include the connecting portion 33 elastically deformed when the upper rail 22 is deformed relative to the bracket 30; therefore, the load due to the deformation
of the upper rail 22 relative to the bracket 30 is refrained from acting on the load detection device 40.  Thus, the connecting portion 33 allows the deformation of the upper rail 22 relative to the bracket 30 to improve the detection accuracy of the
load detection device 40.
 According to the seat apparatus 1 of the embodiment, the bracket 30 is configured as follows in order that the flexural rigidity of the connecting portion 33 is lower than the flexural rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end
portion 32.  Firstly, lengths of the first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a in the vertical direction are adjusted to thereby set the respective flexural rigidities.  Here, the length of the first flange 31a of the front end portion 31 in the
vertical direction, the length of the second flange 32a of the rear end portion 32 in the vertical direction, and the length of the third flange 33a of the connecting portion 33 in the vertical direction are defined as heights H1, H2, and H3,
respectively.  As illustrated in FIG. 3, the height H3 of the third flange 33a formed at the connecting portion 33 is set to be shorter than the heights H1 and H2 of the first flange 31a and the second flange 32a formed at the front end portion 31 and
the rear end portion 32, respectively.  The height H1 of the first flange 31a is set to be longer than the height H2 of the second flange 32a.  The bracket 30 includes the first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a in order to structurally
increase the flexural rigidity of the bracket 30 in the vertical direction.  In other words, the height H3 of the third flange 33a of the connecting portion 33 is set to be small, thereby easily decreasing the flexural rigidity in the vertical direction.
 Secondly, a width of a whole flat surface of the bracket 30 in the lateral direction is adjusted as follows to thereby set the flexural rigidity.  Here, a width of a flat surface of the front end portion 31, a width of a flat surface of the rear
end portion 32, and a width of a flat surface of the connecting portion 33 are defined as widths W1, W2, and W3 in the lateral direction.  As illustrated in FIG. 4, the width W3 of the flat surface of the connecting portion 33 is set to be smaller than
the width W1 of the flat surface of the front end portion 31 and the width W2 of the flat surface of the rear end portion 32.  The width W1 of the flat surface of the front end portion 31 is set to be larger than the width W2 of the flat surface of the
rear end portion 32.  The width W1 of the front end portion 31 in the lateral direction is appropriately set so that the front end portion 31 may be directly fixed to the upper rail 22.  Further, the width W2 of the rear end portion 32 in the lateral
direction is appropriately set so that the load detection device 40 may be supported between the rear end portion 32 and the upper rail 22 in the vertical direction.  Thus, the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30 have the
flexural rigidities in the vertical direction which depend on the widths W1 and W2, respectively.  In addition, the width W3 of the connecting portion 33 in the lateral direction is set to be relatively small, thereby easily decreasing the flexural
rigidity in the vertical direction.
 (Effects of the seat apparatus) The bracket 30 configured as described above includes the connecting portion 33 connecting the front end portion 31 to the rear end portion 32.  Further, the flexural rigidity of the connecting portion 33 of the
bracket 30 is set to be low.  In the seat apparatus 1 configured as described above, when the upper rail 22 or the seat frame 14 that constitutes a portion of the seat 10 is deformed, the load due to the deformation may be applied to the attachment
portion of the front or rear end portion of the upper rail 22 and the bracket 30 supporting the seat 10.  Since the bracket 30 is configured as described above, the connecting portion 33 of the bracket 30 allows the deformation of the upper rail 22 or
the like.  Accordingly, the load due to the deformation of the upper rail 22 or the like is refrained from acting on the load detection device 40 arranged between the upper rail 22 and the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30 in the vertical direction. 
As a result, even when the upper rail 22 or the like is deformed, the load due to the deformation is refrained from affecting a detection value of the load detection device 40 and the load detection device 40 may further accurately detect the load
applied to the seat 10.
 In addition, as described above, in a case where the upper rail 22 is deformed relative to the front end portion 31 of the bracket 30, the connecting portion 33 of the bracket 30 is elastically deformed.  Accordingly, the load due to the
deformation of the upper rail 22 relative to the bracket 30 is refrained from acting on the load detection device 40 arranged between the rear end portion 32 of the bracket and the upper rail 22 in the vertical direction.  Consequently, the load
detection device 40 may further accurately detect the load applied to the seat 10.
 Moreover, according to the seat apparatus 1 of the embodiment, the bracket 30 is configured as follows.  Firstly, the lengths of the first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a in the vertical direction are adjusted in order that the
flexural rigidity of the connecting portion 33 is lower than the flexural rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32.  In other words, the height H3 of the third flange 33a formed at the connecting portion 33 is set to be lower
than the heights H1 and H2 of the first flange 31a and the second flange 32a formed at the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32, respectively.  Secondly, the width of the whole flat surface of the bracket 30 in the lateral direction is
adjusted.  In particular, the width W3 of the flat surface of the connecting portion 33 is set to be smaller than the width W1 of the flat surface of the front end portion 31 and the width W2 of the flat surface of the rear end portion 32.  Thus, the
bracket 30 is simply configured by the aforementioned adjustment of the heights and widths of the first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a; thereby, the flexural rigidity of the connecting portion 33 in the vertical direction may be set to be
lower than the flexural rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32.
 According to the seat apparatus 1 of the embodiment, the lift mechanism 50 is arranged between the seat 10 and the brackets 30 in the vertical direction.  In the seat apparatus 1, the seat 10 and the occupant seated on the seat 10 or baggage
placed on the seat 10 are moved upward and downward by the lift mechanism 50; therefore, the magnitude or direction of the load applied to the seat 10 tends to vary.  In particular, in a conventional seat apparatus, an amount of deformation of the upper
rail 22 or the seat frame 14 that constitutes a portion of the seat 10 varies in accordance with the adjustment of the position of the seat 10 in the vertical direction by the lift mechanism 50 and the load applied to the load detection device 40 via the
bracket 30 also varies.
 As described above, the bracket 30 having the aforementioned configuration is applied to the seat apparatus 1 of the embodiment.  Consequently, in a case where the upper rail 22 or the like is deformed by the adjustment of the position of the
seat 10 in the vertical direction by the lift mechanism 50, the load due to the deformation of the upper rail 22 or the like is refrained from acting on the detection value of the load detection device 40.  As a result, the load detection device 40 may
further accurately detect the load applied to the seat 10.  Thus, the bracket 30 in which the flexural rigidity of the connecting portion 33 is set to be low is applied to the seat apparatus 1 provided with the lift mechanism 50, therefore effectively
improving the detection accuracy of the load detection device 40.
 In addition, according to the seat apparatus 1 of the embodiment, the load detection devices 40 are arranged at the respective rear end portions of the pair of upper rails 22.  Such arrangement of the load detection devices 40 may further reduce
manufacturing, assembling, and wiring costs, compared to a case where the load detection devices 40 are arranged at the attachment portions of the respective front and rear end portions of the pair of upper rails 22.  On the other hand, in a case where
the load detection devices 40 are arranged at the respective rear end portions of the pair of upper rails 22, information detected by the load detection devices 40 may be less compared to a case where the load detection devices 40 are arranged at the
attachment portions of the respective front and rear end portions of the pair of upper rails 22.  In this case, errors included in a sum total of detection values of the load detection devices 40 due to the deformation of the upper rail 22 or the like
are expected to be reduced.  Furthermore, in a case where the occupant is seated on the seat 10, the center of gravity of the occupant is positioned further rearward than an intermediate position of the seat 10 in the longitudinal direction. 
Accordingly, the load of the seat 10 including the load of the occupant is mainly applied to the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30 supporting the seat 10.  That is, the load acting in the direction to detach the bracket 30 from the upper rail 22 is
applied to the front end portion 31 of the bracket 30 and the load acting in the direction to press the bracket 30 against the upper rail 22 is applied to the rear end portion of the bracket 30.
 Accordingly, the bracket 30 configured as described above is applied to the seat apparatus 1 and the load detection device 40 is arranged between the upper rail 22 and the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30; thereby, the load due to the
deformation of the upper rail 22 or the like is refrained from acting on the load detection device 40.  Consequently, even when the upper rail 22 or the like is deformed, the deformation is refrained from affecting the detection value of the load
detection device 40 and the load detection device 40 may further accurately detect the load applied to the seat 10.
 According to the seat apparatus 1 of the embodiment, the heights H1, H2, and H3 and the width W1, W2, and W3 of the first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a of the bracket 30 are adjusted in order that the flexural rigidity of the
connecting portion 33 is lower than the flexural rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32.  Alternatively, the bracket 30 may be configured in a different manner from the configuration according to the embodiment as long as the
connecting portion 33 may be set to be low.
 For example, as illustrated in FIG. 6, the bracket 30 may be configured so that a thickness T3 of the connecting portion 33 in the lateral direction is smaller than a thickness T1 of the front end portion 31 in the lateral direction and a
thickness T2 of the rear end portion 32 in the lateral direction.  In the seat apparatus 1 according to the embodiment, the bracket 30 supports the seat 10 including the occupant seated on the seat 10 or the baggage placed on the seat 10.  Accordingly,
the thicknesses T1, T2, and T3 of the bracket 30 in the lateral direction are set appropriately so that a predetermined strength may be obtained; therefore, the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32 have the flexural rigidities in the vertical
direction which depend on the respective thicknesses T1 and T3.  Thus, the flexural rigidity of the connecting portion 33 in the vertical direction may be set to be lower than the flexural rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion
32 in the vertical direction by the aforementioned configuration of the bracket 30.
 Moreover, according to the seat apparatus 1 of the embodiment, the bracket 30 is configured to include the front end portion 31 serving as the first end portion fixed to the upper rail 22, and the rear end portion 32 serving as the second end
portion.  The load detection device 40 is supported between the rear end portion 32 (second end portion) of the bracket 30 and the upper rail 22.  Alternatively, the bracket 30 may be configured to include the rear end portion 32 serving as the first end
portion fixed to the upper rail 22 and the front end portion 31 serving as the second end portion.  The load detection device 40 is supported between the front end portion 31 (second end portion) of the bracket 30 and the upper rail 22.  Thus, a seat
apparatus in which the load detection device 40 is arranged at one of the front and rear end portions of the upper rail 22 serving as the slide rail may function similarly to the function of the seat apparatus 1 according to the embodiment.
 As described above, according to the aforementioned embodiment, the seat apparatus 1 includes the upper rail 22 arranged slidably relative to the floor 2 in the longitudinal direction, the bracket 30 including the front end portion 31 fixed to
the upper rail 22, the rear end portion 32, and the connecting portion 33 connecting the front end portion 31 to the rear end portion 32, the seat 10 supported by the bracket 30, and the load detection device 40 arranged between the upper rail 22 and the
rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30 and detecting the load applied to the seat 10.  The flexural rigidity of the connecting portion 33 of the bracket 30 in the vertical direction of the vehicle is set to be lower than the flexural rigidities of the
front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30 in the vertical direction.
 For example, in the seat apparatus 1 of the embodiment including the load detection device 40 arranged between the upper rail 22 and the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30 in the vertical direction, the load due to the deformation of the
upper rail 22 or the frame 14 that constitutes a portion of the seat 10 may be applied to the attachment portion of the front or rear end portion of the upper rail 22 and the bracket 30 that supports the seat 10.  The deformation due to the deformation
of the upper rail 22 or the frame 14 acts in the direction to detach the bracket 30 from the upper rail 22 or in the direction to press the bracket 30 against the upper rail 22, i.e., the load due to the deformation the upper rail 22 or the frame 14 acts
in the vertical direction.  As described above, the bracket 30 of the seat apparatus 1 is configured so that the flexural rigidity of the connecting portion 33 connecting the front end portion 31 to the second end portion 32 is lower than the flexural
rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32; therefore, the connecting portion 33 is deformed so as to allow the deformation of the upper rail 22 or the frame 14.  Accordingly, the load due to the deformation of the upper rail 22
or the like is refrained from being transmitted to the load detection device 40 arranged between the upper rail 22 and the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30.  Consequently, even when the upper rail 22 or the like is deformed, the load due to the
deformation of the upper rail 22 or the like is refrained from acting on the load detection device 40 and the load detection device 40 may further accurately detect the load applied to the seat 10.
 According to the aforementioned embodiment, when the upper rail 22 is deformed relative to the bracket 30, the connecting portion 33 is elastically deformed to restrain the load due to the deformation of the upper rail 22 from acting on the load
detection device 40.
 For example, the upper rail 22 is deformed relative to the front end portion 31 of the bracket 30 depending on the variations of the magnitude or direction of the load applied to the seat 10 and depending on the adjusted position of the seat 10. At this time, the bracket 30 supporting the seat 10 and including the connecting portion 33 having the flexural rigidity lower than the flexural rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32, is elastically deformed, thereby allowing
the deformation of the upper rail 22 relative to the bracket 30.  Accordingly, the load detection device 40 may further accurately detect the load applied to the seat 10.
 According to the aforementioned embodiment, the bracket 30 includes the first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a formed at the front end portion 31, the rear end portion 32, and the connecting portion 33, respectively.  The first,
second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a are arranged at the peripheral side edge in the lateral direction of the vehicle while extending at least upward and downward from the peripheral side edge.  The height H3 of the third flange 33a in the
vertical direction is set to be shorter than the height H1 of the first flange 31a and the height H2 of the second flange 32a.
 Accordingly, the flexure rigidity of the connecting portion 33 in the vertical direction may be easily set to be lower than the flexure rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32.
 According to the aforementioned embodiment, the bracket 30 is configured so that the width W3 of the connecting portion 33 in the lateral direction of the vehicle is smaller than the widths W1 and W2 of the front end portion 31 and the rear end
portion 32, respectively, in the lateral direction.
 Accordingly, the flexure rigidity of the connecting portion 33 in the vertical direction may be easily set to be lower than the flexure rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32.
 According to the aforementioned embodiment, the bracket 30 is configured so that the thickness T3 of the connecting portion 33 in the lateral direction of the vehicle is smaller than the thicknesses T1 and T2 of the front end portion 31 and the
rear end portion 32, respectively, in the lateral direction.
 Accordingly, the flexure rigidity of the connecting portion 33 in the vertical direction may be easily set to be lower than the flexure rigidities of the front end portion 31 and the rear end portion 32.
 According to the aforementioned embodiment, the seat apparatus 1 further includes the lift mechanism 50 arranged between the seat 10 and the bracket 30 in the vertical direction and moving the seat 10 upward and downward relative to the floor 2.
 In the seat apparatus 1 configured as described above, the occupant seated on the seat 10 or the baggage placed on the seat 10 is moved upward and downward by the operation of the lift mechanism 50.  Accordingly, the magnitude or direction of
the load applied to the seat 10 tends to vary.  In particular, in the conventional seat apparatus, the amount of deformation of the upper rail 22 or the seat frame 14 that constitutes a portion of the seat 10 varies and the load acting on the load
detection device 40 via the bracket 30 also varies.
 Accordingly, in a case where the position of the seat 10 in the vertical direction is adjusted by the operation of the lift mechanism 50, the load due to the deformation of the upper rail 22 or the like is refrained from acting on the detection
value of the load detection device 40 by the bracket 30 configured as described above.  As a result, the load detection device 40 may further accurately detect the load applied to the seat 10.  Thus, the bracket 30 in which the flexural rigidity of the
connecting portion 33 is set to be low is applied to the seat apparatus 1 provided with the lift mechanism 50; therefore, the detection accuracy of the load detection device 40 is effectively increased.
 According to the aforementioned embodiment, the seat apparatus 1 includes the upper rail 22 including the pair of upper rails 22 adapted to be arranged on the floor 2 and keeping the predetermined distance from each other in the lateral
direction of the vehicle, and the bracket 30 including the pair of brackets 30 adapted to be fixed to the pair of slide rails 22.  The load detection device 40 is arranged between each of the pair of upper rails 22 and the rear end portion 32 of each of
the pair of brackets 30.  The rear end portion 32 is positioned rearward relative to the front end portion 31 in the longitudinal direction.
 Thus, the load detection devices 40 are arranged at the respective rear end portions of the pair of the upper rails 22 in the lateral direction, thereby further reducing the manufacturing, assembling, and wiring costs compared to a case where
the load detection devices 40 are arranged at the attachment portions of the respective front and rear end portions of the pair of upper rails 22.  On the other hand, in a case where the load detection devices 40 are arranged at the respective rear end
portions of the pair of upper rails 22, the information detected by the load detection devices 40 may be less compared to a case where the load detection devices 40 are arranged at the attachment portions of the respective front and rear end portions of
the pair of upper rails 22.
 Accordingly, in the seat apparatus 1 where the load detection devices 40 are arranged at the respective rear end portions of the pair of upper rails 22, the errors included in the sum total of the detection values of the load detection devices
40 due to the deformation of the upper rail 22 or the like are expected to be reduced.  Furthermore, in a case where the occupant is seated on the seat 10, the center of gravity of the occupant is positioned further rearward than the intermediate
position of the seat 10 in the longitudinal direction.  Accordingly, the load of the seat 10 including the load of the occupant is mainly applied to the rear end portion 32 of the bracket 30 supporting the seat 10.  That is, the load acting in the
direction to detach the bracket 30 from the upper rail 22 is applied to the front end portion 31 of the bracket 30 and the load acting in the direction to press the bracket 30 against the upper rail 22 is applied to the rear end portion of the bracket
30.  Consequently, the bracket 30 configured as described above is applied to the seat apparatus 1 and each load detection device 40 is arranged between the upper rail 22 and the rear end portion of the upper rail 22.  As a result, the load due to the
deformation of the upper rail 22 or the like is refrained from being transferred to the load detection device 40.  Thus, the load due to the deformation of the upper rail 22 or the like is refrained from acting on the load detection device 40 and the
load detection device 40 may further accurately detect the load applied to the seat 10.
 According to the aforementioned embodiment, the bracket 30 includes the first, second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a formed at the front end portion 31, the rear end portion 32, and the connecting portion 33, respectively.  The first,
second, and third flanges 31a, 32a, and 33a are arranged at the peripheral side edge in the lateral direction of the vehicle while extending at least upward and downward from the peripheral side edge.  The height H1 of the first flange 31a is set to be
longer than the height H2 of the second flange 32.
 According to the aforementioned embodiment, the width W1 of the front end portion 31 in the lateral direction of the vehicle is larger than the width W2 of the rear end portion 32 in the lateral direction.
 According to the aforementioned embodiment, the bracket 30 is configured so that one of the side surfaces in the lateral direction includes the flat surface.
 According to the aforementioned embodiment, the bracket 30 is designed to have the front end portion 31, the rear end portion 32, and the connecting portion 33 that are formed in the uniform thickness.
 The principles, preferred embodiment and mode of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification.  However, the invention which is intended to be protected is not to be construed as limited to the particular
embodiments disclosed.  Further, the embodiments described herein are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive.  Variations and changes may be made by others, and equivalents employed, without departing from the spirit of the present
invention.  Accordingly, it is expressly intended that all such variations, changes and equivalents which fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the claims, be embraced thereby.

",,"INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
 The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-191761 filed on Aug.  21, 2009 including the specification, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The invention relates to a structure for fastening a clip to a trim board of a vehicle, and more specifically to a technology for making it possible to simultaneously fit multiple clips to clip fitting seats formed at multiple locations of a
trim board.
 2.  Description of the Related Art
 There is known a structure for fixing a trim board, used as vehicle interior parts, to a vehicle body-side member, for example, an inner panel, with the use of a clip.  This clip has a) a first projection that is fastened to a clip fitting seat
of the trim board, and b) a second projection that is fastened to the vehicle body-side member.  c) As the second projection is fastened to the vehicle body-side member with the first projection fastened to the trim board, the trim board is fixed to the
vehicle body-side member.  Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2004-183798 (JP-A-2004-183798) describes an example of the above-described fastening structure.  According to JP-A-2004-183798, a ball is provided as a first projection, and a
spherical recess is formed in a cylindrical clip fitting seat formed on a trim board.  The ball is inserted into the clip fitting seat in a direction perpendicular to the trim board and then fitted into the spherical recess, and widening prevented ribs
are engaged with an outer periphery of the clip fitting seat.  As a result, a clip is fastened to the trim board.  (See FIGS. 1 to 3.)
 However, in the above-described usual clip fitting structure, unless the clip is fastened to the trim board in one stroke so that the ball of the clip is fitted into the spherical recess, that is called fastened state, the clip is removed from
the spherical recess.  Therefore, it is difficult to simultaneously fit the multiple clips to the clip fitting seats with the use of, for example, a press machine.  Usually, the multiple clip fitting seats are formed on the trim board, and the trim board
is fixed to a vehicle body-side member via the multiple clips.  Therefore, it is necessary to perform a cumbersome work, that is, to fit the multiple clips one by one to the clip fitting seats.  Even when the clips are pushed by a press machine to be
fastened to the clip fitting seats, it is necessary to fit the clips one by one to the clip fitting seats.  Accordingly, fastening the clips to the clip fitting seats takes a long time, which is not efficient.

portions of the pair of lug members so as to face each other; and the distance between the pair of latch lugs is enlarged due to elastic deformation of the pair of lug members so that each of the small-diameter portion and the large-diameter portion is
permitted to pass through between the pair of latch lugs.
 The object indicated above may be achieved according to a fifth aspect of the invention, which provides the structure for fastening the clip to the trim board according to the fourth aspect of the invention, wherein end portions of the pair of
latch lugs have arc-shaped portions centering on a fitting axis 0 for fastening the clip and having a diameter d that is smaller than the small-diameter portion and larger than the clearance g between the pair of lug members when viewed from the
fastening direction.
 The object indicated above may be achieved according to a sixth aspect of the invention, which provides the structure for fastening the clip to the trim board according to the fourth or fifth aspect of the invention, wherein: (a) the pair of lug
members has a pair of vertical plate portions that rise up from the trim board so as to be parallel to each other, and lateral plate portions that extend from upper end portions of the vertical plate portions bent in a direction that is substantially
perpendicular to the vertical plate portions in such a manner that end portions of the lateral plate portions face each other with the clearance g left therebetween; and (b) the end portions of the lateral plate portions are stepped portions that are
formed by bending to recess the end portions of the lateral plate portions toward the trim board, and the stepped portions are used as the latch lugs.
 The object indicated above may be achieved according to a seventh aspect of the invention, which provides the structure for fastening the clip to the trim board according to the fourth or fifth aspect of the invention, wherein: (a) the pair of
lug members has a pair of vertical plate portions that rise up from the trim board, and are substantially parallel to each other with the clearance g left therebetween at least upper end portions of the pair of vertical plate portions, and the latch lugs
are formed integrally with portions of the upper end portions, which face each other; and (b) through-holes are formed in portions of the vertical-plate portions, which are immediately below the latch lugs, and each of the small-diameter portion and the
large-diameter portion, which has passed through between the latch lugs while elastically deforming the vertical plate portions in such a manner that the vertical plate portions are further apart from each other, is latched with an upper edges of the
through-holes so as to be prevented from being removed.
 The object indicated above may be achieved according to an eighth aspect of the invention, which provides the structure for fastening the clip to the trim board according to any one of the first to seventh aspects of the invention, wherein a
plurality of the clip fitting seats, to which the clips are fastened and of which the fastening directions are parallel to each other, is formed on the trim board.
 The object indicated above may be achieved according to a ninth aspect of the invention, which provides the clip used in the structure for fastening the clip to the trim board according to any one of the second to seventh aspects of the
invention.
 The object indicated above may be achieved according to a tenth aspect of the invention, which provides a method for fastening the clips to the multiple clip fitting seats in the structure for fastening the clip to the trim board according to
the eighth aspect of the invention, including: (a) an intermediate fastening step for achieving the intermediate fastened state by relatively moving the clips close to the multiple clip fitting seats in the fastening directions; and (b) a final fastening
step for achieving the final fastened state by simultaneously relatively pushing the multiple clips fastened to the clip fitting seats in the intermediate fastened state in the fastening directions by a pushing machine.
 According to the first aspect of the invention, the first projection has an engagement portion having a diameter that locally increases and decreases in a predetermined fastening direction that is substantially perpendicular to the trim board
and the clip fitting seat has multiple latch lugs that are used to position the clip and elastically deformed in such a manner that a distance between the latch lugs is enlargeable as the engagement portion is engaged with the latch lugs, so that the
first projection is fastened to the clip fitting seat by being pushed in the fastening direction; and at least two types of the engagement portions that differ in diameter are formed in the first projection at locations that are apart from each other in
the fastening direction or at least two sets of the latch lugs that differ in engaging area, at which the latch lugs are engaged with the engagement portion, are formed in the clip fitting seat at locations that are apart from each other in the fastening
direction, so that the clip is fastened to the clip fitting seat in at least two staged fastened states which include an intermediate fastened state that is achieved by fastening the clip to the clip fitting seat at low fastening load and a final
fastened state that is achieved by fastening the clip to the clip fitting seat at high fastening load.  As described above, it is possible to fasten the clip to the clip fitting seat in the intermediate fastened state, and the clip is pushed in the
predetermined fastening direction, which is substantially perpendicular to the trim board, to be fastened to the clip fitting seat.  Therefore, even if the multiple clip fitting seats are formed, the clips, which have been, for example, manually fastened
to the clip fitting seats in the intermediate fastened state, are simultaneously pushed into the clip fitting seats by, for example, a single press machine to achieve the final fastened state.  Therefore, it is possible to increase the efficiency of the
clip fastening work, and to automatically perform the clip fastening work.  Unlike a usual technology in which a large fastening force is required from the beginning, it is possible to prevent a fastening error, for example, to prevent the clip from
falling down while the clip is fastened to the clip fitting seat.  As a result, the efficiency of the fastening work is improved.
 According to the second aspect of the invention, the first projection of the clip has a small-diameter portion, a constricted portion, a large-diameter portion and a fitted portion that are formed concentrically with each other from a tip end of
the first projection in this order in a direction in which the clip is pushed into the clip fitting seat.  When the clip is relatively moved toward the clip fitting seat in the fastening direction that is substantially perpendicular to the trim board,
first, the small-diameter portion is engaged with the latch lugs formed in the clip fitting seat.  Then, the small-diameter portion passes through between the latch lugs while elastically enlarging the distance between the latch lugs.  As a result, the
intermediate fastened state where the latch lugs are located at the constricted portion is achieved.  When the clip is further pushed, the large-diameter portion passes through between the latch lugs while elastically enlarging the distance between the
latch lugs.  As a result, the final fastened state where the latch lugs are located at the fitted portion is achieved.  For example, multiple constricted portions for achieving the intermediate fastened states may be formed in the first projection so
that the multiple constricted portions pass through between the latch lags before the latch lugs reach the fitted portion.  The structure are formed in such a manner that at least two staged fastened states are achieved.
 In this case, because the small-diameter portion that is located at the tip end of the first projection is smaller in diameter than the large-diameter portion, it is possible to relatively easily push the clip into the clip fitting seat. 
Therefore, the intermediate fastened state is easily achieved, for example, manually.  In order to shift the state from the intermediate fastened state to the final fastened state, the large-diameter portion that is larger in diameter than the
small-diameter portion need to pass through between the latch lugs.  Therefore, the clip is pushed with a relatively large pushing force (at high fastening load) by, for example, the press machine.  Thus, it is possible to fasten the clip to the clip
fitting seat with predetermined fastening strength.
 According to the third aspect of the invention, the large-diameter portion has a tapered face having a diameter that decreases toward the constricted portion, and the set of latch lugs has partially tapered holding faces that correspond to the
tapered face; and in the intermediate fastened state, the tapered face of the large-diameter portion is in surface-contact with the holding faces of the latch lugs so that the clip is positioned so as to take a certain posture.  Thus, the posture of the
clip in the intermediate fastened state is stabilized.  Therefore, when the clip is further pushed to be placed in the final fastened state, it is possible to prevent product failure, which may be caused if the clip falls down.  As a result, the
production yield is improved.
 According to the fourth aspect of the invention, the clip fitting seat is formed of a pair of lug members which extend from the trim board; a pair of the latch lugs is formed in the upper end portions of the pair of lug members so as to face
each other; and the distance between the pair of latch lugs is enlarged due to elastic deformation of the pair of lug members so that each of the small-diameter portion and the large-diameter portion is permitted to pass through between the pair of latch
lugs.  As described above, each of the small-diameter portion and the large-diameter portion is permitted to pass through between the latch lugs due to elastic defamation of the pair of lug members.  Therefore, the stiffness of the latch lugs is higher
and the clip is more firmly fastened to the clip fitting seat with higher fastening strength than when, for example, only the latch lugs, which are part of the lug members, are elastically deformed.  In addition, it is possible to easily adjust the
fastening load and the fastening strength for the clip by changing the thickness or the shape of the pair of lug members.
 According to the fifth aspect of the invention, end portions of the pair of latch lugs have arc-shaped portions centering on a fitting axis O for fastening the clip and having a diameter d that is smaller than the small-diameter portion and
larger than the clearance g between the pair of lug members.  Due to the arc-shaped portions of the pair of latch lugs, the clip is fastened to the trim board in such a manner that the central axis of the clip coincides with the fitting axis O at high
position accuracy.  As a result, it is possible to more easily perform the work for fixing the trim board to the vehicle body-side member via the clip.
 According to the sixth aspect of the invention, the pair of lug members has a pair of vertical plate portions that rise up from the trim board so as to be parallel to each other, and lateral plate portions that extend from upper end portions of
the vertical plate portions bent in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the vertical plate portions in such a manner that end portions of the lateral plate portions are stepped portions that are formed by bending to recess the end portions
of the lateral plate portions toward the trim board, and the stepped portions are used as the latch lugs.  It is possible to easily perform the work for pushing the first projection into the clip fitting seat by elastically deforming the pair of lug
members in such a manner that the pair of latch lugs is deformed so as to bend toward the trim board and the distance between the latch lugs is enlarged.  On the other hand, deformation of the latch lugs in the reverse direction, that is, deformation of
the latch lugs in such a direction that these latch lugs are further apart from the trim board is not easy, because the latch lugs and the lug members have relatively high stiffness.  Therefore, once the small-diameter portion or the large-diameter
portion of the first projection passes through between the pair of latch lugs and is fastened to the clip fitting seat, it is difficult to remove the clip from the clip fitting seat.  Accordingly, high fastening strength is achieved.  That is, it is
possible to more easily perform the fastening work by decreasing the fastening load, while ensuring predetermined fastening strength.  In addition, a relatively large space is formed in the inner side of the pair of lug members.  Accordingly, for
example, moldability while the lug members and the trim board are formed integrally with each other improves, which makes it easier to design molding dies including a slide die.
 According to the seventh aspect of the invention, the clip fitting seat has a pair of vertical plate portions, and the latch lugs are formed with portions of upper end portions of the pair of the vertical plate portions, which face each other;
and through-holes are formed in portions, which are immediately below the latch lugs, and each of the small-diameter portion and the large-diameter portion, which has passed through between the latch lugs while elastically deforming the vertical plate
portions in such a manner that the vertical plate portions are further apart from each other, is latched with an upper edges of the through-holes so as to be prevented from being removed.  The latched state of the small-diameter portion or the
large-diameter portion is visually checked directly through the through-holes.  Therefore, it is possible to suppress occurrence of product failure.  In addition, each of the small-diameter portion and the large-diameter portion of the clip passes
through between the latch lugs while elastically deforming the vertical plate portions.  Therefore, the stiffness of the latch lugs is higher and the clip is more firmly fastened to the clip fitting seat with higher fastening strength than when only the
latch lugs, which are part of the lug members, are elastically deformed.  In addition, it is possible to appropriately adjust stiffness of the vertical plate portions, and, consequently, fastening strength for the clip by changing sizes and locations of
the through-holes.
 According to the ninth aspect of the invention, the substantially same effects as those in the structure for fastening the clip to the trim board according to each of the second to seventh aspects of the invention are obtained.
 According to the tenth aspect of the invention, the intermediate fastened state is achieved by relatively moving the clips close to the multiple clip fitting seats in the fastening directions where a plurality of the clip fitting seats is formed
on the trim board; and then the final fastened state is achieved by simultaneously relatively pushing the multiple clips fastened to the clip fitting seats in the intermediate fastened state in the fastening directions by a pushing machine. 
Consequently, the multiple clips can be effectively fastened. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
 The invention relates to a structure for fastening a clip to a trim board, the clip being used to fix the trim board (interior parts), for example, a door trim or an instrument panel, to a vehicle body-side member, for example, an inner panel. 
The trim board is usually made of synthetic resin material, and, for example, an upholstery material is provided on a surface of the trim board when needed.  The clip has, for example, a first projection and a second projection that are aligned along a
single straight line so as to extend in opposite directions, that is, extend outward.  The clip is also made of synthetic resin material.  Alternatively, the clip may be made of another material, for example, metal material.
 Usually, multiple clip fitting seats are formed integrally with the trim board, and the clips are fastened to the clip fitting seats.  The trim board is fixed to the vehicle body-side member via the multiple clips.  The multiple clip fitting
seats are formed in such postures that fastening directions, in which the clips are fastened to the clip fitting seats, are parallel to each other and are substantially perpendicular to the trim board.  The fastening directions are substantially
perpendicular to the trim board so that the multiple clips are simultaneously fitted to the clip fitting seats.  Therefore, the fastening directions need not be exactly perpendicular to the trim board.  The fastening directions may be oblique to the trim
board at a predetermined angle.  Also, the trim board need not have a flat face.  The trim board may be curved or have recesses and projections.  The clip fitting seats need not be formed in uniform postures with respect to the trim board, for example,
the postures in which the clip fitting seats are perpendicular to the trim board, as long as the fastening directions in which the clips are fastened to the clip fitting seats are parallel to each other.
 When the clip is fastened to the clip fitting seat of the trim board, the clip may be moved toward the trim board.  Alternatively, the trim board may be moved toward the clip.  The manner in which the clip is fastened to the clip fitting seat
may be different between an intermediate fastening step and a final fastening step.
 In the second invention, the first projection has a small-diameter portion, a constricted portion, a large-diameter portion and a fitted portion that are formed concentrically with each other from a tip end of the first projection in this order
in a direction in which the clip is pushed into the clip fitting seat.  Two fastened states, that is, an intermediate fastened state where latch lugs are located at the constricted portion and a final fastened state where the latch lugs are located at
the fitted portion are achieved.  Alternatively, the structure may be formed in such a manner that three or more staged fastened states are achieved.  For example, a medium-diameter portion and a constricted portion may be further formed between the
constricted portion and the large-diameter portion so that intermediate fastened states are achieved at two locations in the axial direction.  At least a higher fastening load (pushing load when the clip is fastened to the clip fitting seat) is required
to achieve the final fastened state than to achieve the intermediate fastened state, and the final fastened state need not be a fastened state where fastening strength, that is, a load required to remove the clip from the clip fitting seat is high.
 In the first invention, large-diameter projected portions (engagement portions) may be formed in the first projection at two locations that are apart from each other in the fastening direction and engaged with engagement recesses formed in the
latch lugs.  Alternatively, a single engagement portion (an engagement recess or a projected portion) may be formed in the first projection and two sets of the latch lugs may be formed in the clip fitting seat at two locations that are apart from each
other in the fastening direction so that two staged fastened states are achieved.  For example, in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 to 3 of JP-A-2004-183798, spherical recesses 18 that correspond to the latch lugs may be formed in a fitting seat 16 at two
locations that are apart from each other in the axial direction.  The structure may be formed in such a manner that three or more staged fastened states that differ in fastening load are achieved.
 A set of latch lugs or at least two sets of latch lugs may be formed, and a distance between the latch lugs in each set may be enlarged, for example, due to elastic deformation of the latch lugs themselves or due to elastic deformation of
support portions such as vertical plate portions having the latch lugs.  A set of latch lugs includes multiple latch lugs.  For example, a pair of latch lugs is formed so as to be symmetric with respect to a fitting axis O, along which the first
projection is fastened into the clip fitting seat.  Alternatively, three or more latch lugs may be formed equiangularly around the fitting axis O. Asymmetric latch lugs may be employed.  In a pair of lug members in the fourth aspect of the invention, at
least the lug members are elastically deformed.  Alternatively, the latch lugs may be elastically deformed in addition to the lug members.
 In the third aspect of the invention, a tapered face is formed in the large-diameter portion, and the tapered face is in surface-contact with partially tapered holding faces formed in the multiple (a set of) latch lugs in the intermediate
fastened state.  However, in the other aspects of the invention, the clip may be positioned to take a certain posture, for example, when the clip is engaged with the clip fitting seat at multiple locations that are apart from each other in the fastening
direction.
 In the fifth aspect of the invention, end portions of the pair of latch lugs have arc-shaped portions centering on a fitting axis O and having a diameter d, and when the arc-shaped portions and, for example, the small-diameter portion are
engaged with each other, the central axis of the first projection coincides with the fitting axis O. However, various modifications may be made in the other inventions.  For example, one of the pair of latch lugs may be formed in a flat shape, or
V-shaped portions may be formed instead of the arc-shaped portions.
 In the sixth aspect of the invention, end portions of the lateral plate portions are stepped portions that are formed by bending to recess the end portions of the lateral plate portions toward the trim board, and the stepped portions are used as
the latch lugs.  However, in the other inventions, various modifications may be made.  For example, the lateral plate portions that are substantially flat may be used as the latch lugs without being processed.
 In the seventh invention, through-holes are formed in the vertical plate portions, and the latched state of each of the small-diameter portion and the large-diameter portion is visually checked directly through the through-holes.  However, in
the other inventions, recesses at which each of the small-diameter portion and the large-diameter portion can be latched may be only formed.
 In the tenth invention, when multiple clip fitting seats are formed on the trim board, the final fastened state is achieved by simultaneously relatively pushing the multiple clips fastened to the clip fitting seats in the intermediate fastened
state in the fastening directions by a pushing machine.  In the intermediate fastening step, the clips may be fastened one by one to the clip fitting seats manually or by a low-load clip fastening machine (e.g. an air cylinder).  In the other inventions,
the clips may be fastened one by one to the clip fitting seats manually or by a pushing machine (e.g. an air cylinder or a hydraulic cylinder) in the final fastening step as well.
 Hereafter, a first embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.  FIGS. 1A to 1C are views showing a vehicle door trim 10 to which the first embodiment of the invention is applied.  FIG. 1A is a view
schematically showing an outer face of the vehicle door trim 10, that is, a vehicle compartment-side face of the vehicle door trim 10.  FIG. 1B is a view schematically showing an inner face of the vehicle door trim 10, which is on the opposite side of
the outer face.  FIG. 1C is a perspective view showing an IC portion in FIG. 1B viewed from a direction of an arrow A. The vehicle door trim 10 corresponds to a trim board, and is made of synthetic resin material and formed as a single-piece member. 
Multiple (eight, in FIG. 1B) clip fitting seats 14 are formed integrally with an outer periphery portion of an inner face 12 that is located inside of a door (on the outer side of a vehicle compartment).  Clips 16 are fastened to the clip fitting seats
14.  When the clips 16 are integrally fastened in fitting holes 20 fowled in an inner panel 18 of the vehicle door (see FIG. 3B), the vehicle door trim 10 is fixed to the inner panel 18.  The inner panel 18 corresponds to a vehicle body-side member.
 FIG. 2 is an enlarged cross-sectional view showing the IC portion taken along the line II-II in FIG. IC.  FIGS. 4A to 4C are views showing the clip fitting seat 14 to which the clip 16 has not been fastened.  FIGS. 5A and 5B are views showing
only the clip 16.  FIG. 4A is a perspective view corresponding to FIG. 1C, FIG. 4B is a cross-sectional view corresponding to FIG. 2, that is, an enlarged cross-sectional view showing the clip fitting seat 14 taken along the line IVB-IVB in FIG. 4A, and
FIG. 4C is a plain view showing a portion near a fitting axis O viewed from a direction in which the clip 16 is fastened to the clip fitting seat 14 (hereinafter, referred to as ""fastening direction"" where appropriate) (viewed from above the clip fitting
seat 14 in FIG. 4B).  FIG. 5A is a perspective view showing the clip 16 viewed from a point that is slightly oblique to and above the clip 16.  FIG. 5B is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of the clip 16, which includes a central axis S.
 As shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, the clip 16 has a first projection 30 and a second projection 32 that are aligned along the central axis S so as to extend in opposite directions, that is, extend outward.  In addition, a first seating portion 34,
which is large-diameter flange like and which is seated in the clip fitting seat 14, and a second seating portion 36, which is large-diameter flange like and which is seated in the inner panel 18, are formed between the first projection 30 and the second
projection 32.  The first projection 30, the second projection 32, the first seating portion 34 and the second seating portion 36 are made of synthetic resin material and formed integrally with each other.  The first projection 30 has a small-diameter
portion 40, a constricted portion 42 that is smaller in diameter than the small-diameter portion 40, a large-diameter portion 44 that is larger in diameter than the small-diameter portion 40, and a small-diameter fitted portion 46 fanned between the
large-diameter portion 44 and the first seating portion 34, which are formed concentrically with each other and which are located in this order from a tip end of the first projection 30 in a direction in which the first projection 30 is pushed into the
clip fitting seat 14.  With this structure, the first projection 30 is fastened to the clip fitting seat 14 by being pushed into the clip fitting seat 14 in the fastening direction that is substantially perpendicular to the vehicle door trim 10 (up-down
direction in FIG. 4B).  The small-diameter portion 40 is formed in a tapered shape, as a whole, in such a manner that a diameter thereof is decreased toward a tip end.  In addition, a large-diameter base end-side outer peripheral portion of the
small-diameter portion 40 has a smooth arc shape in a cross section shown in FIG. 5B, and is connected to the small-diameter constricted portion 42.  The large-diameter portion 44 has a tapered face 44t having a diameter that is decreased toward the
constricted portion 42.  The fitted portion 46 is formed in a shape of a column having a predetermined diameter D. The fitted portion 46 has a predetermined length so that the clip 16 is integrally fastened to the clip fitting seat 14 in a certain
posture when an upper end portion of the clip fitting seat 14 is elastically clamped between the large-diameter portion 44 and the first seating portion 34 as shown in FIG. 2.
 The second projection 32 has a base end portion that is formed in a shape of a column that is larger in diameter than the fitting hole 20 of the inner panel 18, and a spindle-shaped tip end portion that projects from the base end portion and
that has a smooth semi-elliptical shape in a cross-section in FIG. 5B.  In addition, the second projection 32 has a fitted portion 48 that is a constricted portion which is smaller in diameter than the fitting hole 20, and that is formed between the base
end portion and the second seating portion 36.  As shown in FIG. 3B, the second projection 32 is inserted into the fitting hole 20 from the tip end portion thereof.  After the column-shaped base end portion passes through the fitting hole 20 while being
elastically deformed, the inner panel 18 is located at the fitted portion 48 and the inner panel 18 is elastically clamped between the second projection 32 and the second seating portion 36.  As a result, the clip 16 is fastened to the inner panel 18,
and, consequently, the vehicle door trim 10 is fixed to the inner panel 18.
 The clip fitting seat 14 shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B has a pair of lug members 50a and 50b that are provided integrally with the vehicle door trim 10 so as to rise up in a direction substantially perpendicular to the vehicle door trim 10.  The lug
members 50a and 50b are formed integrally with the vehicle door trim 10 with the use of a slide die (draw back die) or the like.  The lug members 50a and 50b are formed so as to be symmetric with respect to the fitting axis O that is substantially
perpendicular to the vehicle door trim 10.  The lug members 50a and 50b have vertical plate portions 54a and 54b and the lateral plate portions 56a and 56b, respectively, and each of the lug members 50a and 50b has a substantially L-shaped cross section. The vertical plate portions 54a and 54b rise up from the inner face 12 of the vehicle door trim 10 in a direction substantially perpendicular to the inner face 12.  The lateral plate portions 56a and 56b extend from upper ends of the vertical plate
portions 54a and 54b bent in a direction substantially perpendicular to the vertical plate portions 54a and 54b in such a manner that end portions of the lateral plate portions 56a and 56b face each other.  The end portions of the lateral plate portions
56a and 56b, which face each other, are apart from each other by a small clearance g, which is smaller than the small-diameter portion 40.  In addition, the end portions are stepped portions or crank-shaped portions that are formed by bending to recess
the end portions of the lateral plate portions 56a and 56b toward the vehicle door trim 10.  Thus the formed stepped portions are used as latch lugs 58a and 58b.  The small-diameter portion 40 shown in FIG. 4C indicates the maximum diameter of the
small-diameter portion 40, and the clearance g is smaller than the maximum diameter of the small-diameter portion 40.
 In a planar view of the clip fitting seat 14 viewed from the direction in which the clip 16 is fitted to the clip fitting seat 14 (in a state shown in FIG. 4C), the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b has arc-shaped portions 59a and 59b centering on
the fitting axis O and having a diameter d that is smaller than the small-diameter portion 40 and larger than the clearance g. When the arc-shaped portions 59a and 59b and the small-diameter portion 40 are engaged with each other, the central axis S of
the clip 16 coincides with the fitting axis O. When the clip 16 is moved toward the clip fitting seat 14 from above the clip fitting seat 14 in FIG. 4B and the small-diameter portion 40 is engaged with the latch lugs 58a and 58b, the pair of lug members
50a and 50b is elastically deformed as indicated by arrows B in FIG. 6B.  Thus, the distance between the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b is enlarged in the lateral direction, whereby the small-diameter portion 40 is permitted to pass through between the
latch lugs 58a and 58b.  In the first embodiment, the upper end portions of the vertical plate portions 54a and 54b are elastically deformed in directions in which the upper end portions are further apart from each other, and corner portions, at which
the vertical plate portions 54a and 54b and the lateral plate portions 56a and 56b are connected to each other, are elastically deformed in such a manner that the angles between the vertical plate portions 54a and 54b and the lateral plate portions 56a
and 56b are reduced.  In this way, the distance between the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b is enlarged while the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b is deformed so as to bend toward the vehicle door trim 10.  Thus, the clip 16 is positioned in an intermediate
fastened state where the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b is located at the constricted portion 42 and clamped between the small-diameter portion 40 and the large-diameter portion 44 as shown in FIG. 6C.
 The distance between the small-diameter portion 40 and the large-diameter portion 44 is set to a value at which the clip 16 is positioned without wobbling when the latch lugs 58a and 58b are clamped between the small-diameter portion 40 and the
large-diameter portion 44 of the clip 16.  Partially tapered holding faces 60a and 60b (see FIGS. 4A to 4C), which correspond to the tapered face 44t formed in the large-diameter portion 44, are formed in upper faces of the latch lugs 58a and 58b,
respectively.  When the holding faces 60a and 60b are pushed against the tapered face 44t and brought into surface-contact with the tapered face 44t in the intermediate fastened state, the clip 16 is positioned so as to take a certain posture in which
the central axis S of the clip 16 substantially coincides with the fitting axis O.
 When the clip 16, which has been in the intermediate fastened state described above, is further pushed in the fastening direction indicated by the arrow A as shown in FIG. 6D, the lug members 50a and 50b are engaged with the large-diameter
portion 44 and elastically deformed as indicated by the arrows B and the distance between the latch lugs 58a and 58b is enlarged.  Thus, the large-diameter portion 44 is permitted to pass through between the latch lugs 58a and 58b.  As a result, the clip
16 is positioned in a final fastened state where the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b is located at the fitted portion 46 and the latch lugs 58a and 58b and the lateral plate portions 56a and 56b are located between the large-diameter portion 44 and the
first seating portion 34 as shown in FIG. 6E.  Because the large-diameter portion 44 is larger in diameter than the small-diameter portion 40, the lug members 50a and 50b need to be elastically deformed by a larger amount to permit the large-diameter
portion 44 to pass through between the latch lugs 58a and 58b.  Therefore, a larger pushing force (higher fastening load) is required in the final fastening step in FIG. 6D than in the intermediate fastening step in FIG. 6B.  The clip 16 is fastened more
firmly to the clip fitting seat 14 with higher fastening strength in the final fastened state than in the intermediate fastened state.  The first seating portion 34 that is larger in diameter than the large-diameter portion 44 is pushed against and
tightly fastened to upper faces of the lateral plate portions 56a and 56b, and the clip 16 is held in a certain posture in which the central axis S substantially coincides with the fitting axis O more stably than in the intermediate fastened state.  Each
of a second diameter increase/decrease portion of the first projection 30, which extends from the large-diameter portion 44 through the fitted portion 46 to the first seating portion 34 and which is used to position the clip 16 in the final fastened
state, and a first diameter increase/decrease portion of the first projection 30, which extends from the small-diameter portion 40 through the constricted portion 42 to the large-diameter portion 44 and which is used to position the clip 16 in the
intermediate fastened state, corresponds to an engagement portion in claim 1.
 It is possible to restrict and control the location of the clip 16 in the final fastened state by appropriately setting the diameter D of the column-shaped fitted portion 46 (see FIG. 5A) and the diameter d of the arc-shaped portions 59a and 59b
formed in the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b (see FIG. 4C).  That is, if a predetermined amount of backlash is formed between the fitted portion 46 and the arc-shaped portions 59a and 59b, the clip 16 is permitted to move by a predetermined distance,
which makes it possible to absorb a location deviation (positioning error) that may occur when the multiple clips 16 are fastened to engage with in the fitting holes 20 of the inner panel 18.  If necessary, the clearance g may be set to a value smaller
than the diameter D, when the clip 16 is positioned.
 The multiple clip fitting seats 14 are formed on the inner face 12 of the vehicle door trim 10 in such a manner that the fitting axes O of the clip fitting seats 14 are substantially parallel to each other.  Although the vehicle door trim 10 is
not an entirely flat face and is partially curved or inclined, the clip fitting seats 14 are formed on the vehicle door trim 10 in postures in which the fitting axes O, that is, the fastening directions, are parallel to each other regardless of the shape
of the vehicle door trim 10.  Therefore, it is possible to fit the clips 16 to the clip fitting seats 14 in the certain fastening directions.
 The clips 16 may be fastened to the clip fitting seats 14 formed at multiple locations of the vehicle door trim 10, for example, according to the steps (fastening method) shown in FIGS. 6A to 6E.  FIGS. 6A to GE are views illustrating basic
fastening steps.  In the intermediate fastening step in FIG. 6B, the clip 16 is relatively pushed into the clip fitting seat 14 in the fastening direction indicated by the arrow A with a comparatively small force.  Thus, the small-diameter portion 40
passes through between the latch lugs 58a and 58b while elastically deforming the pair of lug members 50a and 50b to enlarge the distance between the latch lugs 58a and 58b as indicated by the arrows B. As a result, the intermediate fastened state shown
in FIG. 6C is achieved.  When the clip 16, which has been in the intermediate fastened state, is further pushed relatively into the clip fitting seat 14 with a large force in the fastening direction indicated by the arrow A as shown in FIG. 6D, the
large-diameter portion 44 passes through between the latch lugs 58a and 58b while elastically deforming the pair of lug members 50a and 50b by a large amount to enlarge the distance between the latch lugs 58a and 58b as indicated by the arrows B. As a
result, the final fastened state shown in FIG. 6E is achieved.  It is possible to automatically perform both of the fastening steps in FIGS. 6B and 6D with the use of a fastening machine that uses, for example, an air cylinder or a hydraulic cylinder. 
Alternatively, a worker may manually perform all the steps.  The clips 16 may be manually fastened one by one to the clip fitting seats 14 in the intermediate fastening step in FIG. 6B, and the clips 16 may be automatically fastened to the multiple clip
fitting seats 14 with the use of a fastening machine that uses, for example, a hydraulic cylinder in the final fastening step in FIG. 6D.
 FIGS. 7A and 7B show a case where both of the fastening steps in FIGS. 6B and 6D are automatically performed with the use of a fastening machine.  FIG. 7A shows the intermediate fastening step, and FIG. 7B shows the final fastening step.  In the
intermediate fastening step in FIG. 7A, the vehicle door trim 10 placed on a lower die 63 of a molding machine 62, which is used to form the vehicle door trim 10 and the multiple clip fitting seats 14 integrally with each other, is lifted and moved to an
intermediate fastening site by a molded component removing robot 64.  The molded component removing robot 64 has a removing attachment 66 to which, for example, an suction device is fitted.  In the intermediate fastening site, the clips 16 are prepared
to be placed at locations corresponding to the multiple clip fitting seats 14, and a supply feeder 68, for example, an air cylinder is provided.  The clips 16 are pushed upward one by one by the supply feeder 68 and fastened to the clip fitting seats 14
in the intermediate fastened state.
 In the final fastening step in FIG. 711, the vehicle door trim 10, where the clips 16 are fastened to the multiple clip fitting seats 14 in the intermediate fastened state, is placed on a base 70 in a posture in which the clips 16 face upward. 
When the base 70 is lifted upward by a pushing machine 72, for example, a hydraulic cylinder, the clips 16 come into contact cylindrical pushing jigs 74 that are arranged above the clip fitting seats 14.  Thus, the clips 16 are simultaneously pushed
relatively into the clip fitting seats 14 and placed in the final fastened state.  As the pushing machine 72, for example, a press machine is preferably used.
 In the structure for fastening the clip to the vehicle door trim 10 according to the first embodiment, the small-diameter portion 40, the constricted portion 42, the large-diameter portion 44, and the fitted portion 46 are concentrically formed
in the first projection 30 of the clip 16 in this order from the tip end of the first projection 30 in the fastening direction.  When the clip 16 is moved relatively toward the clip fitting seat 14 in the fastening direction that is parallel to the
fitting axis O that is substantially perpendicular to the vehicle door trim 10, first, the small-diameter portion 40 is engaged with the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b formed in the clip fitting seats 14 as shown in FIG. 6B.  Then, the small-diameter
portion 40 passes through between the latch lugs 58a and 58b while elastically enlarging the distance between the latch lugs 58a and 58b.  As a result, the intermediate fastened state where the latch lugs 58a and 58b are located at the constricted
portion 42 is achieved as shown in FIG. 6C.  When the clip 16 is further pushed, the large-diameter portion 44 passes through between the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b while elastically enlarging the distance between the latch lugs 58a and 58b as shown
in FIG. 6D.  As a result, the final fastened state where the latch lugs 58a and 58b are located at the fitted portion 46 is achieved as shown in FIG. 6E.
 In this case, because the small-diameter portion 40 that is located at the tip end of the first projection 30 is smaller in diameter than the large-diameter portion 44, it is possible to relatively easily push the clip 16 into the clip fitting
seat 14 in the intermediate fastening step.  Therefore, the intermediate fastened state is easily achieved, for example, manually.  In order to shift the state from the intermediate fastened state to the final fastened state, the large-diameter portion
44 that is larger in diameter than the small-diameter portion 40 need to pass through between the latch lugs 58a and 58b.  Therefore, the clip 16 is pushed with a relatively large pushing force (at high fastening load) in the final fastening step.  Thus,
it is possible to fit the clip 16 to the clip fitting seat 14 with predetermined fastening strength.
 With the clip fastening structure according to the first embodiment, it is possible to fit the clip 16 to the clip fitting seat 14 in the intermediate fastened state, and the clip 16 is pushed in the fastening direction, which is parallel to the
fitting axis O that is substantially perpendicular to the vehicle door trim 10, to be fastened to the clip fitting seat 14.  Therefore, even if the multiple clip fitting seats 14 are formed, the clips 16, which have been fastened to the clip fitting
seats 14 in the intermediate fastened state, are simultaneously pushed into the clip fitting seats 14 by the single pushing machine 72, for example, in the final fastening step shown in FIG. 7B to achieve the final fastened state.  Therefore, it is
possible to increase the efficiency of the clip fastening work, and to automatically perform the clip fastening work.  Unlike a usual technology in which a large fastening force is required from the beginning, it is possible to prevent a fastening error,
for example, to prevent the clip 16 from tipping over while the clip 16 is fastened to the clip fitting seat 14.  As a result, the efficiency of the fastening work is improved.  In the intermediate fastening step, it is possible to automatically fit the
clips 16 to the multiple clip fitting seats 14 in the intermediate fastened state with the use of the molded component removing robot 64 and the supply feeder 68, for example, as in the intermediate fastening step in FIG. 7A.
 In the first embodiment, the large-diameter portion 44 of the first projection 30 of the clip 16 has the tapered face 44t having the diameter that is decreased toward the constricted portion 42, and the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b has the
partially tapered holding faces 60a and 60b, which conform to the tapered face 44t.  In the intermediate fastened state, the tapered face 44t of the large-diameter portion 44 is pushed against and brought into surface-contact with the holding faces 60a
and 60b of the latch lugs 58a and 58b, the clip 16 is positioned so as to take a certain posture.  Thus, the posture of the clip 16 in the intermediate fastened state is stabilized.  Therefore, when the clip 16 is further pushed to be placed in the final
fastened state, it is possible to prevent product failure, which may be caused if the clip 16 tips over.  As a result, the production yield is improved.
 In the first embodiment, the clip fitting seat 14 is formed of the pair of lug members 50a and 50b rising up from the vehicle door trim 10, and the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b is formed at the upper end portions of the lug members 50a and 50b
so as to face each other.  In addition, the small-diameter portion 40 and the large-diameter portion 44 of the first projection 30 are permitted to pass through between the latch lugs 58a and 58b due to elastic deformation of the pair of lug members 50a
and 50b.  Therefore, the stiffness of the latch lugs 58a and 58b can be higher so that the clip 16 is more firmly fastened to the clip fitting seat 14 with higher fastening strength than when, for example, only the latch lugs 58a and 58b, which are part
of the lug members 50a and 50b, are elastically deformed.  In addition, it is possible to easily adjust the fastening load and the fastening strength for the clip 16 by changing the thickness or the shape of the pair of lug members 50a and 50b.
 The pair of lug members 50a and 50b is formed of the vertical plate portions 54a and 54b that rise up from the vehicle door trim 10 so as to parallel to each other, and the lateral plate portions 56a and 56b that extend from the upper end
portions of the vertical plate portions 54a and 54b bent in the direction substantially perpendicular to the vertical plate portions 54a and 54b in such a manner that the end portions of the lateral plate portions 56a and 56b face each other.  In
addition, the end portions of the lateral plate portions 56a and 56b are the stepped portions that are used as the latch lugs 58a and 58b.  Therefore, it is possible to easily perform the work for pushing the first projection 30 into the clip fitting
seat 14 by elastically deforming the pair of lug members 50a and 50b as indicated by the arrows B as shown in FIGS. 6B and 6D in such a manner that the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b is deformed so as to bend toward the vehicle door trim 10 and the
distance between the latch lugs 58a and 58b is enlarged.  On the other hand, deformation of the latch lugs 58a and 58b in the reverse direction, that is, deformation of the latch lugs 58a and 58b in such a direction that these latch lugs 58a and 58b are
further apart from the vehicle door trim 10 (upward in each of FIGS. 6A to 6E) is not easy, because the latch lugs 58a and 58b and the lug members 50a and 50b have relatively high stiffness.  Therefore, once the small-diameter portion 40 or the
large-diameter portion 44 of the first projection 30 passes between the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b and is fastened to the clip fitting seat 14, it is difficult to remove the clip 16 from the clip fitting seat 14.  Accordingly, high fastening strength
is achieved.  That is, it is possible to more easily perform the fastening work by decreasing the fastening load, while ensuring predetermined fastening strength.  In addition, a relatively large space is formed on the inner side of the pair of lug
members 50a and 50b.  Accordingly, moldability when the lug members 50a and 50b and the vehicle door trim 10 are formed integrally with each other improves, which makes it easier to design molding dies including a slide die.
 In the first embodiment, the arc-shaped portions 59a and 59b, which are centering on the fitting axis O and having the predetermined diameter d, are formed in end portions of the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b.  Due to the arc-shaped portions
59a and 59b, the clip 16 is fastened to the vehicle door trim 10 in such a manner that the central axis S of the clip 16 coincides with the fitting axis O at high accuracy.  As a result, it is possible to more easily perform the work for fastening the
vehicle door trim 10 to the inner panel 18 via the clip 16.
 Next, other embodiments of the invention will be described.  In the following embodiments, the portions that are substantially the same as those in the first embodiment will be denoted by the same reference numerals as those in the first
embodiment, and detailed description thereof will not be provided below.
 FIGS. 8A to 8C are views showing a clip fitting seat according to a second embodiment, and correspond to FIGS. 4A to 4C, respectively.  FIGS. 9A to 9E are views illustrating steps for fastening the clip 16 to a clip fitting seat 80 in FIG. 8,
and correspond to FIGS. 6A to 6E, respectively.  The clip fitting seat 80 has a pair of lug members 82a and 82b extending from the vehicle door trim 10 and formed integrally with the vehicle door trim 10.  The lug members 82a and 82b are formed
integrally with the vehicle door trim 10, and fowled so as to be symmetric with respect to the fitting axis O that is substantially perpendicular to the vehicle door trim 10.  The lug members 82a and 82b have vertical plate portions 84a and 84b and
lateral plate portions 86a and 86b, respectively.  The vertical plate portions 84a and 84b rise up from the inner face 12 of the vehicle door trim 10.  The lateral plate portions 86a and 86b extend from upper ends of the vertical plate portions 84a and
84b bent in opposite directions that are substantially perpendicular to the vertical plate portions 84a and 84b, respectively.  Each of the lug members 82a and 82b has a substantially L-shaped cross section as a whole.  The vertical plate portions 84a
and 84b are bent at middle portions in such a manner that upper portions of the vertical plate portions 84a and 84b are parallel to each other and substantially perpendicular to the vehicle door trim and lower portions of the vertical plate portions 84a
and 84b are oblique to the upper portions.  Base end portions of the lateral plate portions 86a and 86b, that are close to each other, that is, the upper end portions of the vertical plate portions 84a and 84h are apart from each other by the clearance g
which is smaller than the diameter (maximum diameter) of the small-diameter portion 40 of the clip 16.  In addition, a pair of latch lugs 88a and 88b is formed in the base end portions of the lateral plate portions 86a and 86b, that is, the upper end
portions of the vertical plate portions 84a and 84b, which face each other.
 In a planar view of the clip fitting seat 14 viewed from the direction in which the clip 16 is fastened to the clip fitting seat 80 (in a state shown in FIG. 8C), the pair of latch lugs 88a and 88b has arc-shaped portions 89a and 89b centering
on the fitting axis 0 and having the diameter d that is smaller than the small-diameter portion 40 and larger than the clearance g. When the arc-shaped portions 89a and 89b and the small-diameter portion 40 are engaged with each other, the central axis S
of the clip 16 coincides with the fitting axis O. When the clip 16 is moved close toward the clip fitting seat 80 from above the clip fitting seat 80 in FIG. 8B and the small-diameter portion 40 is engaged with the latch lugs 88a and 88b, the pair of lug
members 82a and 82b is elastically deformed so as to be further apart from each other in right and left direction as indicated by arrows C in FIG. 9B.  Thus, the distance between the pair of latch lugs 88a and 88b is enlarged in the lateral direction,
whereby the small-diameter portion 40 is permitted to pass through between the latch lugs 88a and 88b.  Thus, the clip 16 is positioned in an intermediate fastened state where the pair of latch lugs 88a and 88b is located at the constricted portion 42
and clamped between the small-diameter portion 40 and the large-diameter portion 44 as shown in FIG. 9C.  Partially tapered holding faces 90a and 90b, which conform to the tapered face 44t formed in the large-diameter portion 44, are formed in upper
faces of the latch lugs 88a and 88b, respectively.  When the holding faces 90a and 90b are pushed against the tapered face 44t and brought into surface-contact with the tapered face 44t in the intermediate fastened state, the clip 16 is positioned so as
to take a certain posture in which the central axis S of the clip 16 substantially coincides with the fitting axis O.
 When the clip 16, which has been in the intermediate fastened state, is further pushed in the fastening direction indicated by an arrow A as shown in FIG. 9D, the latch lugs 88a and 88b are engaged with the large-diameter portion 44 and the
distance between the latch lugs 88a and 88b is enlarged while the lug members 82a and 82b are elastically deformed by a larger amount as indicated by arrows C. Thus, the large-diameter portion 44 is permitted to pass through between the latch lugs 88a
and 88b.  As a result, the clip 16 is positioned in a final fastened state where the pair of latch lugs 88a and 88b is located at the fitted portion 46 and the latch lugs 88a and 88b and the lateral plate portions 86a and 86b are located between the
large-diameter portion 44 and the first seating portion 34 as shown in FIG. 9E.  Because the large-diameter portion 44 is larger in diameter than the small-diameter portion 40, the lug members 82a and 82b need to be elastically deformed by a larger
amount to permit the large-diameter portion 44 to pass through between the latch lugs 88a and 88b.  Therefore, a larger pushing force (higher fastening load) is required in the final fastening step in FIG. 9D than in the intermediate fastening step in
FIG. 9B.  The clip 16 is fastened more firmly to the clip fitting seat 80 with higher fastening strength in the final fastened state than in the intermediate fastened state.  The first seating portion 34 that is larger in diameter than the large-diameter
portion 44 is pushed against and tightly fastened to upper faces of the lateral plate portions 86a and 86b, and the clip 16 is held in a certain posture in which the central axis S substantially coincides with the fitting axis O more stably than in the
intermediate fastened state.
 The clip 16 has the small-diameter portion 40, the constricted portion 42, the large-diameter portion 44, the fitted portion 46, the first seating portion 34, etc., and has substantially the same structure as that in the first embodiment. 
However, a diameter and an axial length of each portion are set appropriately based on a required strength, dimensions of the latch lugs 88a and 88b, etc.
 Through-holes 92a and 92b are formed in portions of the vertical plate portions 84a and 84b of the pair of lug members 82a and 82b, which are immediately below the latch lugs 88a and 88b.  The small-diameter portion 40 or the large-diameter
portion 44, which has passed through between the latch lugs 88a and 88b while elastically deforming the vertical plate portions 84a and 84b in such a manner that the vertical plate portions 84a and 84b are further apart from each other, is latched with
upper edges of the through-holes 92a and 92b so as to be prevented from being removed.  In other words, if the through-holes 92a and 92b are formed, portions above the through-holes 92a and 92b serve as the latch lugs 88a and 88b.  In addition, as shown
in FIG. 10, the latched state of the small-diameter portion 40 or the large-diameter portion 44 is visually checked directly through the through-holes 92a and 92b.  Therefore, it is possible to suppress occurrence of product failure.  It is possible to
appropriately adjust stiffness of the lug members 82a and 82b, and, consequently, fastening strength for the clip 16 by changing sizes and locations of the through-holes 92a and 92b.  FIG. 10 is a side view showing the clip 16 and the clip fitting seat
80 viewed in the direction indicated by an arrow X in FIG. 9E.
 It is possible to control and restrict the location of the clip 16 in the final fastened state by appropriately setting a relationship between widths or shapes of the through-holes 92a and 92b and an outer diameter of the large-diameter portion
44 of the clip 16 or a relationship between the diameter D of the column-shaped fitted portion 46 and the diameter d of the arc-shaped portions 89a and 89b formed in the pair of latch lugs 88a and 88b.  That is, if the width of each of the through-holes
92a and 92b is set to be larger than an outer diameter of the large-diameter portion 44 and the diameter d is set to be larger than the diameter D, the clip 16 is permitted to move.  Therefore, it is possible to absorb a location deviation (positioning
error) that may occur when the multiple clips 16 are fitted in the fitting holes 20 of the inner panel 18.  In the second embodiment as well, if necessary, the clearance g may be set to a value smaller than the diameter D, when the clip 16 is positioned.
 Hereafter, a third embodiment of the invention will be described.  A clip fitting seat 100 in FIGS. 11A and 11B differs from the clip fitting seat 14 in the first embodiment in that a pair of latch lugs (first pair of latch lugs) 102a and 102b,
which are relatively small, is formed at positions above the pair of latch lugs (second pair of latch lugs) 58a and 58b by a predetermined distance.  A first projection 106 of a clip 104 has the large-diameter portion 44 and the fitted portion 46, but
does not have the small-diameter portion 40 and the constricted portion 42.  In the third embodiment, when the large-diameter portion 44 is engaged with the relatively small latch lugs 102a and 102b, the pair of lug members 50a and 50b is elastically
deformed so as to be further apart from each other in the lateral direction and the distance between the latch lugs 102 and 102b is enlarged.  Then, the large-diameter portion 44 passes through between the latch lugs 102a and 102 and is located between
the pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b and the pair of latch lugs 102a and 102b.  As a result, an intermediate fastened state shown in FIG. 11A is achieved.  In the intermediate fastened state, the large-diameter portion 44 is elastically clamped between the
pair of latch lugs 58a and 58b and the pair of latch lugs 102a and 102b, and the tapered face 44t and the holding faces 60a and 60b are brought into the surface-contact with each other.  Thus, the clip 104 is positioned so as to take a certain posture in
which the central axis S and the fitting axis O substantially coincide with each other.
 When the clip 104 is further pushed in the fastening direction, the large-diameter portion 44 elastically deforms the pair of lug members 50a and 50b in such a manner that the distance between the lower latch lugs 58a and 58b is enlarged.  Thus,
the large-diameter portion 44 is permitted to pass through between the latch lugs 58a and 58b.  As a result, as shown in FIG. 11B, the clip 104 is placed in a final fastened state where the latch lugs 58a and 58b have climbed over the large diameter
portion 44, are located at the fitted portion 46, and engaged with the upper face of the large-diameter portion 44, and the first seating portion 34 is seated on the upper faces of the lateral plate portions 56a and 56b, as in the first embodiment.  The
latch lugs 102a and 102b, with which the first projection 106 is first engaged, have small areas at which the latch lugs 102a and 102b are engaged with the large-diameter portion 44 (areas at which the latch lugs 102a and 102b overlap with the
large-diameter portion 44 viewed in the fastening direction), and have low fastening load.  In contrast, the latch lugs 58a and 58b have large areas, at which the latch lugs 58a and 58b are engaged with the large-diameter portion 44, and have high
fastening load.  In the third embodiment, the same effects as those in the first embodiment are obtained.

 ",,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 In armed conflicts, land mines are a serious threat to people or vehicles traveling on the ground.  In recent conflicts around the world, attacks from improvised explosive devices (IED) are becoming more common.  IEDs may also include some form
of armored penetrator, including explosively formed penetrators (EFP).  Armored vehicles, such as the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle, have been designed to help withstand these attacks and minimize harm to the vehicle's occupants.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 A vehicle is provided with one or more structural channels that help to dissipate blast energy and debris from explosions.  In one embodiment, the channel, which is open at both ends, extends vertically through the vehicle.  The channel thereby
provides a passage through the vehicle for blast energy and gas and debris from an explosion beneath the vehicle.  The soldiers in the crew compartment remain isolated and protected from damaging effects of the explosion.
 The channel can have a variety of configurations.  For example, the channel can be in the configuration of a straight-sided cylinder with a round, rectangular, or other cross-section.  The channel can include a converging section and/or a
diverging section to provide a nozzle to further accelerate debris through the passage.  The channel can be in the configuration of a slot open toward the rear, sides, or front of the vehicle.  Multiple channels can be provided in a single vehicle.
 The channel is structurally attached to the structure of the vehicle, becoming another structural component of the vehicle.  In particular, the channel is structurally attached to the hull floor, thereby strengthening and adding rigidity to the
hull floor.  This further increases the ability of the vehicle to withstand an explosion from underneath.  The hull floor can be shaped to function cooperatively with the channel.  For example, the hull floor can be V-shaped, which further redirects
outwardly from the vehicle any blast energy and debris that is not directed into the channel.  In one embodiment, the hull floor is formed with multiple pyramid shapes nested within a base of a larger truncated pyramid shape.  The channel can also serve
as a mount for a platform or accessories, or as a pick point for lifting or picking the vehicle off the ground.
 In another embodiment, the channel is formed from one or more elements having a surface shaped to redirect a blast flow originating beneath the structural enclosure, the surface attached to the structural enclosure adjacent a side of the hull
floor. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 The disclosure of U.S.  Provisional Patent Application No. 61/284,488, filed Dec.  18, 2009, is incorporated by reference herein.
 A vehicle 10, generally an armored vehicle such as an MRAP (mine resistant ambush protected) vehicle or HMMWV (high mobility multipurpose vehicle), is provided with one or more structural channels 20 that extend fully through the vehicle from
the floor 12 to the roof 14 of the vehicle.  See FIGS. 1 and 2.  The blast shock wave and high velocity gas and debris are vented directly through the channel 20 in the vehicle, indicated by arrows 22, thus reducing the blast effects on the vehicle.  The
crew (and/or cargo) compartment 16 is sealed from the interior of the channel, thereby helping to isolate and protect the crew (and/or cargo) from the blast effects.  The channel can occupy a minimal amount of interior space within the vehicle, generally
within the vehicle's center.
 The channel 20 vents energy from an explosive blast through the vehicle early in the event.  The vertical vector component of the directed energy from the blast is often the most damaging.  Thus, the vertical orientation of the channel transmits
the energy and gas and debris through and out the top of the vehicle before they can do more serious damage to the vehicle and its crew.  The channel operates nearly instantaneously, allowing blast gas and debris to pass through the vehicle structure
with minimal redirection or drag.  The vehicle's occupants are substantially separated and insulated from the event.
 The channel wall or walls 24 also form a structural element of the vehicle 10 by supporting the hull floor 12 or underbelly pan and transferring the load from the underbelly pan into the upper structure 18 of the vehicle.  The channel thus
provides another load path through the vehicle in addition to the vehicle's structural pillars.  As a structural supporting element, the channel shortens the unsupported span length of the floor and roof in the vehicle.  The channel wall or walls can
also be designed to buckle to absorb un-vented energy that is transferred to the vehicle.
 The channel 20 is structurally connected directly to the structural enclosure of the vehicle in any suitable manner.  In particular, the channel is structurally attached to the hull floor 12 (the portion of the vehicle structure between the
compartment 16 and the ground), thereby strengthening and adding rigidity to the hull floor.  For example, the channel can be formed from a tube open at the top and bottom ends 26, 28 and attached to the floor 12 by welding or other suitable attachment
mechanism.  The tube is generally attached to the roof 14 of the vehicle.  However, the channel can also be provided with vehicles having a non-structural roof or rag top.  The channel can also be integrally formed with the structural enclosure of the
vehicle.  The channel can be used with any type of structural enclosure for a vehicle, such as a body-on-frame, body-frame integral, unibody or monocoque.
 The channel 20 can be located in any suitable location within the vehicle.  The center of the vehicle is generally a suitable location, because this interior space may be less used.  The channel may have any suitable cross section in plan view. 
For example, the channel can be circular (see FIG. 2) or rectangular.  A vehicle can include a single channel or multiple channels.  Multiple channels could each have a smaller cross-sectional area than a single channel if used in a cluster.  Referring
to FIGS. 3 and 4, multiple channels 120 can be also located, for example, along the fore-aft centerline of a long vehicle 110.  One or more channels 220 can also be provided at selected locations, such as behind passenger seats 211 of a vehicle 210.  See
FIGS. 5 and 6.  In this embodiment, the seats can be structurally supported by the channels.  FIG. 7 illustrates a gunner seat 311 mounted to the structural blast column 320 of a vehicle 310.  In any embodiment, the channels can include a cover that can
be easily pushed out during a blast event.
 The channel can have a straight wall or walls, as shown in FIG. 1.  Alternatively, the channel 420 can include converging and/or diverging wall sections 424, 426 to form a nozzle that accelerates flow through the channel and produces a downward
force on the vehicle 410.  See FIGS. 8 and 9.  The downward force on the vehicle prevents or minimizes lifting or jumping of the vehicle off the ground.  In some instances, more damage can occur to the vehicle and its occupants from landing back on the
ground after lifting off than from the blast itself.
 In another embodiment, the channel 520 can be in the form of one or more slots in the vehicle 510.  The slots can be oriented toward the front, sides or rear of the vehicle.  FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate an embodiment in which a slot 521 is
provided opening toward the rear 513 with converging and diverging wall portions 515, 517.  FIGS. 12 and 13 illustrate an embodiment in which a slot 620 opens toward the rear and another slot 630 is provided opening toward the front of the vehicle.  The
slots can have walls 621, 631 angled to direct the blast outwardly.  The slots can also have a protective surface on the inside, protecting the crew from debris moving through the slot.
 The channel can be used with a variety of hull bottom shapes.  For example, the hull bottom can be flat or V-shaped.  The V-shaped hull can also aid in redirecting the blast energy and debris away from the vehicle.
 Non-flat, angled vehicle bottoms (the so-called ""V"" bottom hull design) have been employed with some success in an effort to divert or guide the blast away from the vehicle, rather than taking the blast directly.  However, as vehicles have
gotten wider, while a significant angle to the ground needs to be maintained to make the ""V"" hull effective, the ground clearance has been reduced.  Two problems with reduced ground clearance are: 1) reduced ground clearance from obstacles, causing the
vehicles to hit the ground more easily, and 2) reduced ground clearance moves the vehicle closer to the explosion source, greatly increasing the local forces (pressures) on the hull.  ""Double-V"" designs have been developed to help reduce the ground
clearance problem, but such designs tend to trap the blast if it is centered on the vehicle.  The present channel(s) can be used with an otherwise conventional ""Double-V"" design to reduce the vehicle's vulnerability to blasts centered under the vehicle,
while preserving desired ground clearance.
 FIG. 14 illustrates a multi-faceted pyramid shaped hull 712 with a blast channel 720 integrated therein.  The pyramid hull has four smaller pyramids 714 nested into the base of a larger truncated pyramid 716.  The blast channel 720 is located in
the center of the four smaller pyramids 714.  This hull shape is also advantageous because the vehicle rides lower to the ground without giving up ground clearance.  This hull shape is effective at reducing blast effects even without the blast channel.
 The structural blast channel forms a stiff structural support to the floor.  This stiff structural support helps to reduce blast effects, even without a vent, by supporting the floor or hull and increasing the mass presented to the blast.  For
example, a hollow box beam or tube or a non-hollow structural beam, such as an I-beam or C-channel, connected from the hull bottom to the roof or near the roof line stiffens the floor/hull.
 While the present discussion has been focused on blasts centered under the vehicle, the present vented channel designs have also proved effective for off-center blasts.  Generally, for non-vented designs, the effects of the blast are reduced as
the blast moves away from the center of the vehicle.  For the vented design, however, within a small area around the vent, the lowest effects are experienced if the blast is directly under the vent, and increases slightly away from the vent, but the
effects are still much lower than the unvented case.  Once outside the vicinity of the vent, the blast is sufficiently off center that the blast effects are reduced anyway (i.e. even for the unvented design).
 The channel does two things that work together to reduce the effects on the occupants: First, the channel reduces the vertical explosive load on the vehicle hull bottom, especially at the center of the hull.  Second, the channel provides a
structural support to the hull bottom, reducing bottom side deflection.  Directing energy into the entire vehicle, not just the hull floor, reduces the energy transferred and the effect on the crew.
 A model of an expanding hemispherical debris field 840 impacting a circular plate 842 with a hole (vent) 844 at the center illustrates the reduction in vertical explosive load on the vehicle hull bottom.  See FIG. 15.  The purpose of this model
is to determine the reduction in momentum (and energy) transferred to a circular hull bottom with a circular venting hole from a uniformly expanding debris field.  The circular geometry is reasonable for a first analysis to look at the effect of the vent
area as a percentage of the total area.  A square bottom with a square hole would not be greatly different.  It is not intended to model all the events effecting the ultimate acceleration of the hull, but to be a simple model that at least captures some
of the potential for a vented system.
 Consider a circular hull 842 of diameter D.sub.o, with a center vent hole 844 of diameter D.sub.i, placed a height h above an expanding debris field 840 of radius r as shown in FIG. 15.  Particles from the debris field can travel to three
different areas: Particles within the vent angle, 0<.PHI.<.PHI..sub.i, pass through the vent and do not transfer momentum to the hull.  Particles within the hull angle, .PHI..sub.i<.PHI.<.PHI..sub.o, interact with the hull and transfer
momentum to the hull.  Particles below the edge of the hull, .PHI..sub.o<.PHI., pass under the hull and do not transfer momentum to the hull.
 The absolute momentum per unit surface area of the debris hemisphere is given by
 .times..times..pi..times..times.  ##EQU00001## The component of momentum per unit hemisphere area normal to the hull bottom (i.e. in a vertical direction) is then
 .times..times..pi..times..times..times..times..times..PHI.  ##EQU00002## Integrating over the portion of the hemisphere that will interact with the hull bottom, using spherical coordinates, yields the total vertical momentum transfer.  The
vertical fraction of the absolute momentum that can be transferred to the hull is then:
 .intg..times..times..pi..times..intg..PHI..times..times..PHI..times..time- s..times..times..times..pi..times..times..times..times..times..PHI..times.- .times..times..times..times..PHI..times.d.PHI..times.d.theta.  ##EQU00003## Carrying out the
integration yields:
 .times..times..times..times..times..PHI..times..times..times..times..time- s..times..PHI..times..times.  ##EQU00004## The ratio of the momentum transferred with a vent to that without a vent gives an indication of the effectiveness of the vent. 
The fraction of vertical momentum that is transferred to the vented plate in comparison to the unvented case is then:
 .times..times..times..times..times..times..times..times..times..times..ti- mes..PHI..times..times..times..times..times..times..PHI..times..times..tim- es..times..times..times..times..PHI..times..times..times..times..times..ti-

.times..times..times..times..times..times..PHI..times..times..times..time- s..times..times..PHI..times..times..times..times..times..times..PHI..times- ..times.  ##EQU00005.2## Assuming the plate with the vent has the same mass as the plate without the
vent, then the fraction of kinetic energy transferred for the vented case in comparison to the unvented case is just the Momentum Fraction squared.  The equal mass assumption is reasonable because the mass of the vehicle with the vent would be close to
that without the vent.  The Energy Fraction is then:
 .times..times..times..times..PHI..times..times..times..times..times..time- s..PHI..times..times..times..times..times..times..PHI..times..times.  ##EQU00006##
 FIG. 16 shows the effect of the vent on the energy transferred.  A 10% vent area can produce a 40% reduction in momentum transferred and a 64% reduction in energy transferred.  This is because the center hole not only releases a portion of the
debris field, it releases the portion that has the most direct angle to the hull bottom.
 Test results have shown that the reduction may be further improved because the debris field is more energetic in the center where the vent is located, something that the uniform debris field model dose not account for.  Also, test results have
shown a further improvement in the reduction by tapering of the vent tube, and by shaping the hull bottom, from that of a flat plate.
 As noted above and as discussed in conjunction with the models below, the present channel is effective in combination with a rigid hull.  To investigate benefits of a rigid hull floor, consider a simplified vehicle under an applied impulse
pressure loading from the bottom.  Before the vehicle has had a chance to displace substantially, the impulse has come and gone, leaving the structure in a state of motion (i.e. velocity).  It is this state of motion that the structure needs to deal
with, and protect the occupants.
 Consider first an idealized completely rigid vehicle as illustrated in FIGS. 17A, 17B.  The pressure impulse I acts over the bottom area A of the vehicle of mass M (FIG. 17A), producing a state of motion characterized by the upward velocity of
the entire vehicle at velocity V (FIG. 17B).  Assuming the pressure impulse acts uniformly over the area A, the resulting velocity is given by:
 .times..intg..times..times..times..times.d.intg..times..times..times..tim- es.d.intg..times..times..times..times.d.times..intg..times..times..times..- times.d.times.  ##EQU00007## where a is the vertical acceleration and t is time.  The
resulting kinetic energy is then:
 .times..times..function..times..times.  ##EQU00008##
 As an example, consider a 21,000 pound vehicle with a 44 ft.sup.2 hull area acted on by a pressure impulse of 500 psi-ms.  The resulting velocity, using the rigid assumption, is 4.9 ft/sec (3.3 mph).  The vehicle is moving upward and on a
collision course with the occupants who have not yet been acted on.  Fortunately, the velocity is low, and the impact will be similar to dropping the occupants into their seats from a height of 4 inches (i.e. dropping an object from a height of 4 inches
results in a velocity of 4.9 ft/s).  The total kinetic energy in the body is about 7,700 ft-lb.
 Consider next a vehicle with a compliant hull bottom acted on by the same pressure impulse loading as the rigid hull, illustrated in FIGS. 18A, 18B.  The impulse (FIG. 18A) now results in the hull bottom flexing upward at a velocity resulting
from the impulse, while the body is motionless (FIG. 18B).
 In order to simplify the flexible nature of the hull bottom, consider a rigid hull bottom connected to the body with springs, illustrated in FIGS. 19A, 19B.  This simple model should still capture the general nature of the flexible hull as it
affects the occupants.  The velocity of the hull bottom just after the impulse (FIG. 19B) is given by:
 .times.  ##EQU00009## and the kinetic energy is given by:
 .times..times.  ##EQU00010##
 If the hull bottom weighs 1000 pounds (of the total 21,000 lb), the velocity just after the impulse is 102 fps (about 70 mph) and the kinetic energy in the hull bottom is 162,000 ft-lb.  This is now roughly equivalent to dropping the occupants
into their seats from a height of 160 feet.  This is a worse situation for the occupants compared to the rigid case.
 This model demonstrates the so-called ""slapping"" effect of a compliant hull bottom into the vehicle (and occupants), which is a real effect and can be detrimental.  The occupants need to be completely isolated from the hull bottom under this
condition.
 An increasingly rigid floor design can also, however, increase the likelihood of hull breach under the explosive load.  Thus, a rigid hull floor in combination with a channel(s) to vent blast energy and gas and debris minimizes this possibility
and can provide a beneficial synergy.
 It is also useful to understand the effect of an off center blast and to look at the effectiveness of the vent channel with less than optimum placement, since the location of a blast cannot be determined in advance.  Referring to FIG. 20, the
hull bottom is modeled as a circular disk 852 of radius R.sub.o with a hole 854 in the center, the vent hole, of radius R.sub.i.  The hull bottom is located a distance h above the ground.  An explosion occurs on the ground at the right side, shown by the
expanding hemispherical debris field 850 of total momentum P. The explosion is offset by a distance S from the center of the vent hole.  x=R sin .phi.  cos .theta.+S y=R sin .phi.  sin .theta.  z=R cos .phi.  For the condition Z=h:
 .times..times..PHI..times..times.  ##EQU00011## .times..times..times..times..PHI..times..times..times..times..theta.  ##EQU00011.2## .times..times..times..times..PHI..times..times..times..times..theta.  ##EQU00011.3## ##EQU00011.4## This yields
a function of two variables for integration.  The integration is done differently than for the centered case.  Here, the integration is over the entire field of the expanding hemisphere, but the integrand is set to zero if the debris is outside of the
annulus defined by R.sub.i.ltoreq.r.ltoreq.R.sub.o
 .intg..times..times..pi..times..intg..pi..times..times..times..pi..ltoreq- ..ltoreq..circleincircle.  .times..times..times..PHI..times..times..times..times..PHI..times.d.PHI..- times.d.theta.  ##EQU00012## .times.  ##EQU00012.2## ##EQU00012.3##

 Calculating the fraction of momentum and energy for the vented versus unvented case, in a similar manner to the centered case, results in the Energy Fraction plot shown in FIG. 21.  While there is an increase in energy transferred, as the blast
moves off center, the vent is still effective, as seen in the plot.
 Structural blast channels can also be taken as any pathway that vents blast waves and debris around the vehicle to lower the blast effects and improve survivability.  Thus, redirecting blast channels can be provided to lower blast effects and
improve survivability.  The force resulting from redirecting the flow with a redirecting blast channel can counteract the effects of other forces resulting from the blast.  The force is generated by changing the momentum of the blast effluent, which can
be accomplished without changing the magnitude of the velocity, or speed, of the flow.  Changing the direction of the flow is all that is needed to create a force.  This is beneficial, because the device does not need to meet the blast effluent head on,
but rather from the side.  Force F is defined by Newton's second law of motion as the time rate of change of momentum P with respect to time t:
 dd ##EQU00013## Force F and momentum P are both vectors.  Thus, as illustrated schematically in FIG. 22, the direction of a flow field 930 can be changed by a redirecting element 920 to create a force 932 acting on a body such as a vehicle 910. 
Multiple sub-elements 922, 924 may also be contained in a single redirecting element, in a layered or cascaded configuration, as illustrated schematically in FIG. 23.
 FIG. 24 schematically illustrates a vehicle hull 950 with a flat bottom 952 without redirecting elements, with a blast (schematically indicated by arrows 954) centered beneath the flat bottom.  FIG. 25 schematically illustrates a vehicle hull
950 with a flat bottom 952 and redirecting channels 960 attached along the side edges 956 of the vehicle in any suitable manner, such as with struts (not shown).  The redirecting channels redirect the flow (schematically indicated by arrows 958) to
produce a force (schematically indicated by arrow 962) on the channels having a component in a downward direction, tending to hold the vehicle down.
 FIG. 26 schematically illustrates a vehicle 970 with a V-hull and redirecting channels 980 attached along the side edges 976 of the vehicle hull.  The redirecting channels redirect the flow from a blast (schematically illustrated by arrows 974)
centered beneath the hull to produce a force (schematically illustrated by arrow 982) on the channels having a component in a downward direction, tending to hold the vehicle down.  FIG. 27 schematically illustrates a vehicle 970 with a V-hull and a
center redirecting channel 984 for off center blasts, which also redirects the flow to produce a force on the channels in a downward direction that tend to hold the vehicle down.
 The redirecting blast channel can also form a thin shell 990 that extends over a large portion of the hull bottom and up along the sides to an extent.  See FIG. 28.  The area 992 of the shell exposed to the most direct portion of the blast
ruptures and allows the blast effluent to enter the space between the shell and the hull.  The hull can be strengthened to be capable of surviving the directed blast where the shell ruptures.  The shell is strong enough to effectively redirect the
effluent moving between the shell and the hull.  This embodiment tends to self adjust to different blast locations that may not be centered under the vehicle, and reduces blast effects and improves survivability.
 In a further aspect of the mitigating effect of a blast on a vehicle, referring to FIG. 29, the channel or channels 1020 in a vehicle 1010 can include a mechanism 1024 to produce an upward force (schematically illustrated by arrow 1026) to hold
the vehicle down during an explosion located beneath the vehicle (schematically illustrated by arrows 1028).  For example, in the embodiment illustrated, combustible material (such as solid rocket fuel) is located within the channel and provides an
upward thrust, similar to an after-burner used in a jet engine.  The fuel can be ignited in any suitable manner, such as by the explosive products that move through the channel or by an ignition source triggered electronically.  In another example, a
counter-reactive force can be produced by the release of compressed gas.
 In another aspect of mitigating the effects of a blast on a vehicle, the vehicle can include a mechanism to produce an upward force to hold the vehicle down during an explosion located beneath the vehicle.  For example, referring to FIGS. 30-31,
a rocket 1124 is located at each corner of the vehicle 1110.  The rockets are initiated by a shock event, for example, using an air bag type of detonation device.  The rocket thrust is directed upwardly, which produces a force tending to hold the vehicle
down.  The rocket burn time is short, sufficient to last the duration of the blast event.  In another example, a counter-reactive force can be produced by the release of compressed gas.
 In a further aspect, the vehicle can include a mechanism to produce an additional downward force to counter the upward force produce by the explosion and subsequent landing back on the ground.  For example, referring to FIGS. 32-33, a rocket
1224 is located at each of the four corners of the vehicle 1210.  The rockets are initiated by a shock event, for example, using an automotive air bag type of detonation device.  The rocket thrust is directed downwardly, which produces a force counter to
the force of an explosion tending to lift the vehicle off the ground.  The rocket burn time is short, sufficient to last the duration of the blast event.  In another example, a counter-reactive force can be produced by the release of compressed gas.
 Any suitable sensing device, such as an accelerometer, can be used to sense when the vehicle is accelerating upwardly or downwardly, and any suitable control mechanism can be provided to actuate either the downward force or the upward force, as
necessary to counteract the blast lifting the vehicle up and the subsequent landing.
 The structural blast channel or channels described above can also serve as a mount for a platform or for accessories.  For example, FIG. 34 illustrates a general platform 1314 mounted to the blast channel 1320 of a vehicle 1310.  The platform
can be mounted or removed quickly.  The platform can include a leg or stem 1316 that slips into the channel.  The channel can remain open for blast mitigation if the leg or stem is also hollow and the platform includes an opening therein.  A fastening
mechanism, such as a pin, can be used if desired to hold the platform to the mount.  Spacers (not shown) to space the platform above the vehicle roof can be used if desired.  The mount is a structural portion of the vehicle and can be disposed over the
center of gravity of the vehicle, which aids to maintain stability.  For example, FIG. 35 schematically illustrates the platform 1314 used to mount rocket launchers 1326, and FIG. 36 illustrates a radar device 1328 mounted to the platform 1314.
 The structural blast channel can be used as a single pick point to lift or service the vehicle.  A device 1430, 1440 can be inserted into the channel 1420 from either the top or the bottom of the vehicle 1410 to pick or to lift the vehicle off
the ground, as illustrated schematically in FIGS. 37 and 38.
 In another aspect, the blast channel can be flexible and stored out of the way most of the time, such as by folding or rolling, and it can open or inflate when a blast occurs.  A flexible channel can be made from, for example, a reinforced
rubber or another composite material.  It can be incorporated within other structural elements to provide structural support to the vehicle.
 It will be appreciated that the embodiments and aspects of the present invention can be combined with each other in various ways.  The invention is not to be limited by what has been particularly shown and described, except as indicated by the
appended claims.

 The doors of automobiles and other motor vehicles are constantly exposed to denting, scratching, marring and other damage, especially in public parking facilities.  This is due largely to the carelessness of people in opening the doors of their
adjacent vehicles, and to the failure to adequately control the movement of shopping carts, carriages, and the like.  Exposure to impact is virtually inevitable in parking lots in which the spaces are of inadequate width, and the problem is exacerbated
by the prevalence of large, oversized personal-use vehicles.  Regrettably, it is also not uncommon for a vehicle surface to be scratched intentionally, as a simple act of mischief or vandalism.
 As far as is known, no means is presently available for readily, conveniently, and adequately protecting the surfaces of vehicle door panels (i.e., the normally painted areas below a window or window frame) from accidental or intentional damage
of the kinds described.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 Broad objects of the invention are to provide a cover assembly for attachment to a door of a motor vehicle to protect the door panel against marring, scratching, and other damage from minor impact, abrasion, and the like; and to provide a motor
vehicle door so protected.
 More specific objects of the invention are to provide such a cover assembly which is readily adjustable, to fit a range of door sizes; is capable of application to all doors of a motor vehicle, be it a two-door or a four-door model; is readily
and conveniently attached and removed, while nevertheless resisting unauthorized removal; and which is of relatively incomplex and economical manufacture.
 It has now been found that certain of the foregoing and related objects of the invention are attained by the provision of a cover assembly comprising first and second, generally rectangular cover panels of padding material, each having at least
one height dimension, taken between upper and lower edges thereof, and at least one width dimension taken between opposite lateral edges thereof, the height of the panels being substantially the same; means for disengageably affixing the cover panels to
one another with adjacent lateral marginal portions thereof overlapped so as to provide a substantially continuous protective cover subassembly; means for disengageably attaching, about structure of the protected vehicle door that extends upwardly of the
door panel, upper portions of the assembled cover panels so as to dispose the protective cover subassembly over the exterior surface of the protected door panel with interior face portions of the panels lying thereagainst and with exterior face portions
thereof exposed; and means for disengageably attaching lower portions of the assembled cover panels to lower portions of the protected vehicle door panel.  The means for disengageably affixing the first and second cover panels to one another is
constructed for varying the extent of overlap of the adjacent lateral marginal portions thereof so as to correspondingly vary the distance between their mutually remote, outer lateral edges and thereby vary the effective width of the protective cover
subassembly.
 In preferred embodiments of the invention the means for disengageably affixing the cover panels to one another will comprise a hook-and-loop type fastener arrangement, comprised of a loop component and a hook component interengagable with one
another.  A first one of the components of the fastener arrangement is provided on a lateral marginal portion of the first panel and on the normally exterior face thereof, and the other of the components of the arrangement is provided on the adjacent
lateral marginal portion of the second panel and on the normally interior face thereof.  The effective width of at least one of the components of the fastener arrangement is sufficient to enable effective interengagement of the components at a plurality
of overlapping positions of the adjacent lateral marginal portions of said first and second cover panels.
 More specifically, at least one of the components of the fastener arrangement will preferably have an effectively generally rectangular configuration, and will extend along substantially the entire height and along a substantial portion of the
width, from adjacent an inner lateral edge, of the second panel.  The cooperating component will desirably take the form of a first strip that extends along the inner lateral edge of the first panel and a second strip that extends, substantially from the
first strip, along the upper edge of the panel toward the outer lateral edge thereof.  The component of the fastener arrangement on the first panel will desirably be the hook component, and the component of the arrangement on the second panel will
desirably be the loop component.
 The means for attaching the upper portions of the assembled cover panels preferably comprises belt structure employed in combination with mounting elements on the cover panels, which elements will desirably define a multiplicity of mutually
spaced passages through which at least a portion of the belt structure passes.  The means for disengageably attaching the lower portions of the assembled cover panels will advantageously comprise at least one holding member attached to each of the cover
panels and constructed to engage a corner portion at the bottom of the protected door panel.  Each of such holding members may comprise a length of material affixed, at its opposite ends, at locations adjacent the lower edges of each cover panel,
typically extending catercorner across a corner at the bottom.  The first cover panel will most desirably have a second length of material affixed adjacent its lower edge, at a location intermediate its opposite lateral edges, and extending at an angle
generally opposite to that at which the catercorner-extending length of material extends.  The lengths of material employed as the holding members will advantageously be resiliently deformable, and may additionally include a pull or handle strip or tab,
connected for facilitating disengagement of the holding member from the engaged corner portion of the protected door panel.
 A plurality of permanent magnet pieces will advantageously be attached to each of the cover panels, at locations spaced inwardly from its periphery, for better securing the cover panels to the vehicle door.  Such magnet pieces will either be
effectively unexposed on the interior face portions of the cover panels, or will be fabricated or comprise a nonabrasive material or surface element.
 Each of the cover panels will normally be comprised of at least two plys of material, the innermost ply being non-abrasive and relatively soft, for contacting the exterior surface of a protected door panel without causing scratching or marring,
and the outermost ply being relatively tough, for affording strong mechanical protection, and water-resistance.  A third ply of material will advantageously be disposed between the innermost and outermost plys, the intermediate ply having cushioning
properties for increasing the ability of the cover subassembly to provide protection against impact.  In most instances an opening will be formed through a corner portion of the first cover panel of the cover subassembly, located near the upper and outer
lateral edges thereof so as to enable ready access at least to the handle of a protected vehicle door.
 Other objects of the invention are attained by the provision of a motor vehicle provided with door-surface protection, comprised of a motor vehicle having at least one door comprising a door panel and structure that extends upwardly thereof; and
a cover assembly having the structure and features hereinabove and hereinafter described.  Upper and lower portions of the assembled cover panels are disengageably attached about the upwardly extending structure of the vehicle door and to lower portions
of the vehicle door panel, respectively, so as to dispose the protective cover subassembly over the exterior surface of the door panel, for substantially its full width, with interior face portions of the cover panels lying thereagainst and with exterior
face portions thereof exposed. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 Turning now to the appended drawings, therein illustrated is a cover assembly embodying the present invention, shown in FIGS. 1 and 4, installed on the passenger-side door of a two-door automobile.  Although not depicted, it will be appreciated
that the cover assembly of the invention may be constructed to enable application to each door of a two-door or a four-door automobile.  It may also be constructed to enable installation on motor vehicles other than automobiles, such as vans, SUVs,
various models of trucks, etc.
 As is best seen in FIGS. 2, 3, and 5 of the drawings, the cover assembly of the invention consists (in this illustrated embodiment) of two cover panels, generally designated respectively by the numerals 10 and 12, and a securing strap, generally
designated by the numeral 14.  Two sleeve-like pieces 16, 18 are attached adjacent the upper edges 19, 21 of the cover panels 10, 12, respectively, and define passages 15, 17 through which the belt component 20 (fabricated, for example, from a webbed
material) passes, the sleeve pieces 16 and 18 being mutually spaced so as to facilitate threading of the strap therethrough; it will be appreciated that the belt 20 is freely movable within the passages 15, 17, and that it will typically also be of
woven, web-like form.  The female and male components 22, 24, of a so-called ""parachute"" buckle are secured by suitable elements 26, 28 to the opposite ends of the belt 20, and are constructed for secure, but readily releasable, interengagement in
telescopic, snap-fit relationship.  The element 26 is received through one of two parallel slots (unnumbered) of a coupling piece 30, with an end portion 32 of the belt 20 being received through the other slot.  Strips 34, 36 of the cooperating,
interengageable components of a conventional hook-and-loop type fastener arrangement (hereinafter referred to for convenience as Velcro) are attached to adjacent sections on the inside of the end portion 32 so as to permit ready adjustment of the
effective length of the strap 14, thereby enabling it to most effectively serve its intended function (as will be described below).
 As is best seen in FIG. 2, two strips 38, 40 of the same Velcro component (normally, the hook component) are affixed on the exterior surface 42 of the larger panel 10, with the strip 40 extending along the upper edge 19, from adjacent its inner
lateral edge 44 toward its outer lateral edge 46, and with the strip 38 extending downwardly therefrom along the inner lateral edge 44.
 Correspondingly, and as is best seen in FIG. 3, a rectangular piece 48 of the cooperating Velcro component (i.e., normally the loop component) is affixed over a substantial area on the face of the inner ply of the smaller panel 12.  It extends
from adjacent the upper edge 21 of the panel 12 almost to its lower edge 25, and from adjacent its inner lateral edge 52 most of the distance to the outer lateral edge 54.
 As will be appreciated, the described arrangement of Velcro components 38, 40, 48 enables selective securement of the cover panels 10, 12 to one another with a very substantial range of variation of overlap, such that the distance between the
respective outer lateral edges 46, 54, and hence the widthwise expanse of the resultant subassembly, can correspondingly be varied quite extensively.  This in turn contributes to the universality of the assembly, enabling a single assembly to be utilized
for a range of vehicle doors of different widths.
 In addition to the features already described, each of the cover panels 10, 12 has a pair of magnets 56 embedded within its thickness at locations spaced inwardly from the periphery of the panel, as is best seen in FIG. 5.  Each magnet 56 is
secured in position by a patch 58, affixed to the inner surface of the innermost ply of material 50.  Needless to say, the magnets serve to increase the security of attachment of the cover panel to the door panel (assuming of course the door panel is
made of a ferric metal), and also to increase the aesthetics of the applied cover panels by minimizing sagging and distortion.  Although solid or sintered metal magnets will normally be employed, it is possible that magnetic pieces having nonabrasive
surfaces might be exposed directly on the interior of the cover panel without concern for scratching or marring of the door surface.  Annular magnet pieces will typically be employed, but it will be appreciated that the particular shape of the magnetic
element will generally be insignificant.
 As is also seen in FIG. 5, the cover panels employed in the assembly of the invention will advantageously comprise an intermediate ply 60, in addition to the inner and outer plys 50, 45.  The inner ply 50 will normally be a non-abrasive and
relatively soft material (e.g., a woven or nonwoven natural or synthetic fleece), whereas the outer ply 45 will normally be of a tough and water-repellent material, such as nylon (in woven or sheet form).  The intermediate ply 60 will generally be
provided to add bulk and cushioning to the cover panel, and consequently will be selected to afford those properties; it may be of a natural or synthetic material, woven, nonwoven, cellular, etc.
 As is best seen in FIG. 3, diagonal straps 62 and 64 on panel 10, and 66 on panel 12, are secured against the surfaces of the inner plys 50, 43, respectively, and serve to engage corner portions of vehicle door panels on which the cover assembly
is mounted.  The strips 62, 64, 66 extend (in the illustrated embodiment) catercorner across the door corner portions when properly mounted thereupon, and they will desirably of an elastic material so as to facilitate engagement and to maintain tension. 
Disengagement is facilitated by the provision of handle or pull straps or tabs 68, one of which is attached intermediate the ends of each strip 62, 64, 66.
 It will be appreciated that the lengths of the strips 62, 64, 66 may vary from one another, and will be selected so as to enable each to best serve its intended function.  For example, because the rear door of a four-door automobile will usually
be formed with a large radius arcuate indentation, so as to follow the structure defining the wheel well, the strip used to secure the attached portion of the cover panel (e.g., strip 64 on panel 10) may desirably be longer than the other two.
 Finally, it will be noted that the panel 10 is formed with a reinforced opening at 70.  This serves of course to enable access to the handle of the vehicle door, and may take any of wide variety of forms.  The same opening may serve to provide
access to either a key-operated lock or an electronic keypad.
 As indicated above, a cover assembly embodying the invention is depicted in FIG. 1 as applied to an automobile door ""D"", the surface 64 of which is visible through the cut-away section in the panel 10.  FIG. 4 depicts the inside of the
automobile door D as it might appear with the cover assembly attached and secured.  As can be seen, the strap 14 encircles the structure of the door at or adjacently above the protected panel, with its end portions secured by engagement of the
cooperating components 22, 24 of the parachute buckle.  Needless to say, after the buckle components have been interengaged the strap 14 can be tightened by pulling the end portion 32 of the belt 20 through the coupling piece 30, and then engaging the
Velcro components 34, 36 at the established level of tightness.  Removal of the cover assembly simply requires release of the buckle components from one another, and displacement of the elastic strips 62, 66 from the engaged corner portions of the door,
conveniently utilizing the pull tabs 68 for that purpose.  Due to the width of the particular door D illustrated, it will be appreciated that only the outermost strips 62, 66 are functional in attaching the cover assembly, with the interior strip 64
being free of securement.
 It will also be appreciated that after the door has been closed the buckle on the strap 14, and the strips 62, 66 and attached straps 68, will be located within the vehicle chamber.  Unauthorized removal will thereby be deterred.
 While, as mentioned above, each cover assembly may be employed for doors of a variety of dimensions and configurations, as a practical matter sets of the panels will desirably be manufactured in a range of sizes, specifically adapted for
particular makes and models of vehicles.  Moreover, it will be appreciated that two sets of assemblies will usually be needed (i.e., one for the passenger's side and a second, of mirror image form, for the driver's side), but it is within the scope of
the present concept to construct a single assembly that can be applied to the doors on both sides of a vehicle.
 By way of specific example, a cover assembly adopted for protection of the door panels of a four-door HONDA ACCORD utilizes a larger cover panel (e.g., panel 10) that measures about 30 inches wide (i.e., between its lateral edges) and a smaller
cover panel (e.g., panel 12) that measures about 22 inches wide, both panels being 33 inches high (i.e., between their upper and lower edges).  The fabric sleeve elements 16, 18 are about 10 inches long (albeit shown in the figures to be of different
lengths) and, on each panel, and they are separated from one another by about two inches; the passages they define are about three inches across.  The elastic diagonal strips adjacent the outer lateral edges of the panels are both about 10 inches long
and one inch wide; the second strip (intermediate the lateral edges of the panel) is, for the reason described above, about 15 inches long; the pull straps are also about 10 inches long.
 The two Velcro strips on the larger panel are each about two inches wide, with the strips along the upper and lateral edges being about 16 and 28 inches long, respectively.  The rectangular Velcro piece provided on the smaller cover panel
measures about 30 inches high and 18 inches wide.  As a result, the subassembly of the two cover panels will, in this example, have a total effective expanse (measured between the remote lateral edges) ranging from about 36 to about 52 inches.
 The embedded annular magnet pieces are typically 27/8 inches in diameter and are capable of generating a holding force of about six pounds each.  The door handle opening is typically located about 10 inches below the upper edge of the cover
panel and extends over a distance of perhaps eight inches, starting at a point about four inches away from the adjacent lateral edge.  The length of the strap that runs along the upper edge of the cover subassembly is about ten feet, adjustable to enable
securement of the assembly throughout the full range of its expanse.
 Apart from dimensional specifications, it will be appreciated that a wide range of variations may be made in the cover assembly of the invention without departure from the scope of the present claims.  Suitable materials of construction will be
obvious to those skilled in the art, taking into account the foregoing description and the functional purposes that have been expressed and/or that would be apparent.  Clearly, while a hook-and-loop fastener arrangement will be optimal in most instances
(due to the physical and functional flexibility and variation that it affords), other suitable fastener means may be employed, such as zippers, hooks and eyes, snap fasteners, and the like.  Obviously, however, if any of these alternative mechanical
fasteners are employed multiple elements (running in a plurality of mutually spaced columns extending between the upper and lower edges, or arranged over an area as an array) will be required to afford adjustability of the overall width of the
subassembly.  Furthermore, while the subassembly will preferably consist of only two cover panels, it will be appreciated that three or more such panels, having any suitable means for varying the effective width of the subassembly, may be employed.  The
means used for attaching the cover panels to the vehicle door can also vary widely, the encircling strap and diagonal bottom strips described herein being only exemplary, albeit preferred.
 Thus, it can be seen that the present invention provides a cover assembly for attachment to a door of a motor vehicle to protect its panel against marring, scratching and other damage from minor impact, abrasion, and the like; and it provides a

BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
 1.  Field of Invention
 The present invention relates to an active hood apparatus for a vehicle.  More particularly, it relates to an active hood apparatus for a vehicle, which can absorb impact with a pedestrian and significantly reduce damage of the pedestrian, by
lifting both front and rear ends of a hood upon collision with the pedestrian.
 2.  Description of Related Art
 The hood of a vehicle is a part that covers the engine room of the vehicle and reduces the engine noise.  Recently, active hood systems are being widely used.
 The active hood systems lift hoods to protect a pedestrian upon collision with a vehicle.  The active hood system is a sort of pedestrian protection safety apparatus that can absorb impact and reduce damage upon collision between a vehicle and a
pedestrian.
 As shown in FIG. 8, a typical active hood system includes a hinge assembly disposed at both rear ends of a hood 10 to serve as an opening/closing point, a hinge actuator 50 disposed near the hinge assembly to lift the hinge assembly, a
pedestrian collision sensor 40 disposed at a bumper of a vehicle, and a controller 42 for receiving a signal from the pedestrian collision sensor 40 and driving the hinge actuator 50.
 Accordingly, upon collision between a vehicle and a pedestrian, the pedestrian collision sensor 40 senses the collision, and the controller 42 receives a collision sensing signal and drives the hinge actuator 50.  In this case, the hinge
assembly is lifted by the driving of the hinge actuator 50, and simultaneously the rear end of the hood 44 equipped with the hinge assembly is lifted and pushes up a pedestrian to absorb impact.
 However, in a typical active hood system, since only a part of pedestrian body is pushed up only by the lifting of the rear end of the hood, the impact-absorbing and damage-reducing functions are ineffective.
 The information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the general background of the invention and should not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that this information forms the
prior art already known to a person skilled in the art.

 According to various embodiments, the pedestrian impact-absorbing and damage-reducing effects can be significantly improved upon collision with a pedestrian, by enabling the rise and fall of the front end of a hood as well as the rise and fall
of the rear end thereof by a typical hinge actuator.  It would be appreciated that improved performance is not limited to the collision with a pedestrian.  Embodiments of the present invention can be used for reducing damages in collision having similar
impacts with other vehicles, elements or structures.
 For this, as shown in FIGS. 1 through 7, a hood latch assembly 20 may be vertically movably disposed on a main frame 10 fixed to a vehicle body such that the hood latch assembly 20 mounted in the vehicle body is ascended and descended by a hood
rise and fall device 30, and the hood rise and fall device 30 may be fixedly disposed on the main frame 10.
 The main frame 10 may have a concavely bent shape at the central portion of the rear surface thereof.  A first slot 11 and a second slot 12 may be substantially vertically formed in the front surface and the both side surfaces of the main frame
10.  The both ends of the main frame may be fixedly coupled to a vehicle body, for instance, at the front side of the engine room.
 The hood latch assembly 20 for locking and releasing the hood may be disposed at the back side of the main frame 10, and may be coupled to the main frame 10 to be substantially vertically movable by the actuation of the hood rise and fall device
30 upon collision with a pedestrian.
 Hereinafter, the configuration of a hood latch assembly according to various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 1 through 4.
 A body plate 22 may be provided in the hood latch assembly 20 to serve as a frame.  The body plate 22, which is a rectangular plate or a plate of other suitable shapes, may have a first insert aperture 21 at the upper portion thereof, into which
a striker 46 formed integrally and/or monolithically with the hood 44 is detachably inserted, and may have a first guide pin 13 and a second guide pin 14 integrally and/or monolithically formed in the front surface and the both side surfaces of the body
plate 22.
 The first guide pin 13 of the body plate may be vertically movably inserted into the first slot 11 formed in the front surface of the main frame 10, and the second guide pin 14 may be vertically movably inserted into the second slot 12 formed in
the both side surfaces of the main frame 10.
 In this case, an auxiliary plate 24 having a smaller area may be disposed to be spaced from the rear surface of the body plate 22, and a second insert aperture 23 may be formed at the upper portion of the auxiliary plate 24 to match the first
insert aperture 21.
 Also, a hood release cable 48 may be mounted at one side of the upper portion of the body plate 22.  The hood release cable 48 may be pulled by the operation of a lever equipped in a driver's seat.
 A locking lever 26 may be pivotably disposed at one side between the body plate 22 and the auxiliary plate 24.  The upper end of the locking lever 26 may be connected to the hood release cable 25 and the lower end of the locking lever 26 may be
hinge-coupled to one side of the auxiliary plate 24.
 A first spring 27 of a return spring type may be disposed to provide an elasticity force to the locking lever 26.  One end of the first spring 27 may be fixed to one side of the body plate 22, and the other end of the first spring 27 may be
fixed to the upper end of the locking lever 26.  The first spring 27 may be elastically compressed when the locking lever 26 is pulled together with the hood release cable 25.
 Also, a latch plate 25 may be pivotably disposed at the other side between the body plate 22 and the auxiliary plate 24.  A third insert aperture 28 may be formed at one end of the latch plate 25.  The striker 46 inserted through the first
insert aperture 21 and the second insert aperture 23 may be lockably inserted into the third insert aperture 28.  The other end of the latch plate 25 may be hinge-coupled to the other side of the auxiliary plate 24.
 A second spring 29 of an extension spring type may be disposed to provide an elasticity force to the latch plate 25.  One end of the second spring 29 may be fixed to one side of the body plate 22, and the other end of the second spring 29 may be
fixed to the other end of the latch plate 25.  The second spring 29 may be extended at a locking location of the latch plate 25, and may provide an elastic force when the latch plate 25 pivots into a releasing location of the latch plate 25.
 A locking hook 16 may integrally and/or monolithically protrude at an inner side of the upper portion of the locking lever 26, and a locking step 15 on which the locking hook 16 is latched may integrally and/or monolithically provide at an outer
side of the upper portion of the latch plate 25.  Accordingly, when the latch plate 25 places the striker 46 on the locking location, the locking hook 16 of the locking lever 26 may be latched on the locking step 15 of the latch plate 25 to lock the
latch plate 25.
 Hereinafter, the configuration of a hood rise and fall device according to various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7.
 First, a hood rise and fall lever 33 may be pivotably mounted in the main frame 10.  A locking groove 31 into which the first guide pin 13 disposed in the body pin 22 of the hood latch assembly 20 is lockably inserted may be formed in one end of
the hood rise and fall lever 33.  A push-up end 32 may protrude just under the locking groove 31 to push up the first guide pin 13.  The other end of the hood rise and fall lever 33 may be hinge-coupled to the main frame 10.
 In this case, a third spring 34 of a coil spring type may be mounted on the hinge coupling point of the hood rise and fall lever 33 to provide an elastic force when the hood rise and fall lever 33 pivots upwardly.
 Also, a stop lever 36 may be mounted in the main frame 10 to constrain the hood rise and fall lever 33 at normal times and release the hood rise and fall lever 33 upon collision with a pedestrian.  The upper end of the stop lever 36 may be
hinge-coupled to the main frame 10.  Also, a hook groove 35 may be formed at the other end of the stop lever 36, and may be engaged with the end of the hood rise and fall lever 33.
 Particularly, for the release of the hood rise and fall lever 33, an actuator 37 may be mounted at a certain location of the main frame 10 to push the hook groove 35 of the stop lever 36.  A vertical end 39 may be integrally and/or
monolithically formed just under the hook groove 35 of the stop lever 36, and may closely adhere to a piston of the actuator 37 to be easily pushed.
 Also, a fourth spring 38 may be mounted on a hinge point of the stop lever 36, and may be elastically compressed upon pivoting of the stop lever 36 for releasing.
 Hereinafter, the operation of an active hood apparatus for a vehicle according to various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
 Releasing of Hood Latch Assembly at Normal Times
 As shown in FIG. 5, the hood latch assembly may perform locking and releasing of the hood at normal times.
 When a lever equipped in the driver's seat is operated to open the hood, the hood release cable 48 may be pulled and thus the upper end of the locking lever 26 may be pulled.  Accordingly, the locking lever 26 may elastically compress the first
spring 27 at the upper end thereof and may pivot on the hinge coupling point at the lower end thereof.
 In this case, as the upper end of the locking lever 26 pivots, the locking hook 16 formed at the inner side of the upper end thereof may be unlatched from the locking step 15 of the latch plate 25.
 Simultaneously, the latch plate 25 may allow the striker 46 to pivot from the locking location to the releasing location by the elastic force of the second spring 29.  Since the latch plate 25 pushes up the striker 46 inserted into the third
insert aperture 28 while pivoting, the hood 44 mounted with the striker 46 may be opened.
 Rise and Fall of Hood Latch Assembly and Hood
 When the pedestrian collision sensor 40 senses a collision with a pedestrian, as described above, the controller 42 may receive a collision signal to operate the hinge actuator 50.  The operation of the hinge actuator 50 may allow the hinge
assembly to rise and the rear end of the hood 44 mounted with the hinge assembly to rise.
 According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the rising operation of the front end of the hood 44 as well as the rear end of the hood 44 may be performed as follows.
 When the piston of the actuator 37 is forwardly driven according to a command signal of the controller 42, the piston may push the vertical end 39 of the stop lever 36 to allow the lower end of the stop lever 36 to pivot.
 Simultaneously, the hood rise and fall lever 33 constrained in the hook groove 35 of the stop lever 36 may be released, and thus the hood rise and fall lever 33 may be upwardly pivoted by an elastic force of the third spring 34.
 Next, the first guide pin 13 disposed in the body plate 22 of the hood latch assembly 20 inserted into the locking groove 31 of the hood rise and fall lever 33 may be withdrawn, and simultaneously the push-up end 32 of the hood rise and fall
lever 33 may push up the first guide pin 13.
 Accordingly, the first guide pin 13 disposed in the front surface of the body plate 22 of the hood latch assembly 20 may move substantially vertically along the first slot 11 of the main frame 10, and the second guide pin 14 of the body plate 22
may move substantially vertically along the second slot 12 of the main frame 10, allowing the hood latch assembly to move substantially vertically.
 Thus, the striker 46 lockably and releasably fitted to the hood latch assembly 20 may be pushed up along with the rise and fall of the hood latch assembly 20, and therefore the front end of the hood 44 integrated with the striker 46 may move
substantially vertically, serving to absorb an impact with a pedestrian.
 The present disclosure provides the following advantages.
 According to embodiments, the pedestrian impact-absorbing effect can be improved, and the pedestrian damage can be significantly reduced upon collision with a pedestrian, by enabling the rise and fall of the front end of a hood as well as the
rise and fall of the rear end thereof by a typical hinge actuator.
 Specifically, the opening/closing of the hood may be performed by a hood latch assembly at normal times, while the hood latch assembly may be ascended and descended by a hood rise and fall device and simultaneously a hood striker coupled to the
hood latch assembly is also ascended and descended upon collision with a pedestrian.  As a result, since the front end of the hood can rise and fall together with the rear end of the hood to push up a pedestrian, the impact-absorbing effect can be
improved, and the damage of the pedestrian can be significantly reduced upon collision with the pedestrian.

TECHNICAL FIELD
 The invention relates to a device for reducing booming noise in a motor vehicle.
BACKGROUND
 In motor vehicles, during travel resonances occur during which the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle is excited by an open window or open sunroof.  The passenger compartment of the motor vehicle acts here as a Helmholtz resonator whose
actual frequency depends essentially on the volume of the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle.  When a resonance occurs, coherent vortex structures are shed at the front edge of the window opening or sunroof opening, and they strike the rear edge
and lead there to pressure waves which excite the passenger compartment of the vehicle and lead in turn to the occurrence of new vortex shedding at the front edge of the opening.
 Whether or not resonance occurs is dependent on the relative speed of the vortex structures, which speed is in turn influenced by the instantaneous speed of the motor vehicle.  What is referred to as booming noise occurs only in limited speed
ranges, but is unpleasant for the occupants of the motor vehicle since such noise is associated with sound pressures of up to approximately 130 dB at frequencies of around 20 Hz.
 A reduction in this sound pressure and therefore a reduction in the booming noise can basically be brought about by preventing the vortex structures from striking the rear edge of the window opening or sunroof opening of the motor vehicle.
 For this purpose, it has already been proposed to bring about a reduction in booming noise by moving the sunroof of a motor vehicle into a comfort position in which the angle of aperture of the sunroof is restricted.
 Furthermore, for this purpose it has already been proposed to position a wind deflector in front of the sunroof in order to move the point where the shedding formed at the front edge strikes regions behind the sunroof opening.
 Furthermore, it is already known to provide such a wind deflector with vortex generators which disrupt the regulatory of the specified shedding.  Such vortex generators are, for example, notches, slits, grooves, knobs or drilled holes in the
wind deflector or tongues which are provided at a suitable location and which oscillate in the air stream.
 In addition, it has already been proposed to reduce sunroof booming by mounting a movable lip on the front edge of the sunroof, wherein this movable lip is excited by actuators, for example with a noise signal, and in this way said lip disrupts
the periodic excitation.  The use of such a movable lip is described, for example, in section 7.3.6 on pages 443-445 of the book Aerodynamic des Automobils [Motor vehicle aerodynamics], Vieweg+Taubner, 5.sup.th edition, ISBN 9783-3-528-03959-2, by
Wolf-Heinrich Hucho.
 DE 100 56 754 A1 discloses a wind deflector for a sunroof opening of a motor vehicle whose wind deflector profile has, on an end side thereof, a series of air inlet openings which are arranged distributed over the width of said wind deflector
profile, and has on an adjacent profile side a row with air outlet openings.  The wind deflector profile is embodied as a hollow profile, wherein the upper boundary wall of the wind deflector profile is penetrated by the air outlet openings.
 DE 199 58 748 B4 discloses a device for influencing the air stream in the region of the roof opening of a vehicle roof.  This known device has a wind deflector which is arranged in a vertically adjustable fashion in the region of the front edge
of the roof opening between a position of rest, in which the upper side of the wind deflector does not project beyond the fixed roof surface, and a first extended position.  In this first extended position, the upper side of the wind deflector projects
beyond the fixed roof surface.  An air stream which flows over the vehicle roof is directed exclusively over the upper side of the wind deflector.  Furthermore, the specified wind deflector can be moved into a second extended position in which an air
stream which flows over the vehicle roof is directed through at least partially under the wind deflector, in order to reduce booming noise.

 Exemplary embodiments will be explained in more detail below with reference to the drawings, in which:
 FIG. 1 shows a sketch of a device for reducing booming noise in a motor vehicle, and
 FIG. 2 shows a sketch of an embodiment of an air source.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 According to various embodiments, the device for reducing booming noise has an air source which is arranged in the motor vehicle and is connected to the wind deflector, wherein the air which is made available by the air source is fed to the wind
deflector and output through the openings thereof.  The air which is output through the openings of the wind deflector disrupts or modifies the through the air stream entering the opening of the motor vehicle from the outside, with the result that no
periodic excitation occurs.  This causes booming noise to be reduced.  Since the air which is made available by the air source flows in the direction of the wind deflector from the passenger compartment of the vehicle, there is no risk, or only very
slight risk, of soiling or blocking of the openings of the wind deflector since air, which generally contains particles from the environment, is not applied to the openings from the outside.
 One embodiment consists in providing a control unit which is connected to the air source and is provided for actuating the air source.  This actuation can easily be performed in such a way that the control unit activates and deactivates the air
source as a function of the instantaneously occurring vehicle speed which is sensed by means of a velocity sensor.  A further refinement consists in the fact that the sensor system is additionally equipped with a pressure sensor and/or a microphone and
the air stream which is output by the air source is modulated as a function of the output signals of the sensor system.  An advantage of this refinement consists in the fact that the activation of the air source and the modulation of the air stream
generated by the air source are performed in a selective fashion as a function of the output signals of the sensor system.  This both prevents unnecessary activation of the air source and also provides the possibility of selectively changing the air
stream made available by the air source, in order to optimize the reduction in booming noise.
 Further advantages consist in the fact that the wind deflector itself does not require any movable parts whatsoever.  Said wind deflector may be manufactured as a plastic component which is configured in a comparatively simple way, with a high
degree of design freedom.  There is no need for any installations at all in the wind deflector, with the result that said wind deflector can be easily configured with respect to its weight.  There is no need for moving parts to be lubricated during
operation of the vehicle.
 FIG. 1 shows a sketch of a device for reducing booming noise in a motor vehicle, in which sketch the components which are necessary to understand various embodiments are illustrated.
 The device which is shown has an air source 1, a hose 2, a wind deflector 3 which is provided with openings 4, a control unit 5, a sensor system 6 and a modulator 7.  The air source 1, the control unit 5 and the modulator 7 are positioned within
a motor vehicle.  The wind deflector 3 is arranged in a customary fashion in front of the sunroof (not shown) of the motor vehicle.  The hose 2 leads from the wind deflector 3 into the interior of the motor vehicle.  The sensor system 6 has, as is
explained further below, a vehicle speed sensor and/or a pressure sensor and/or a microphone.
 The control unit 5 is connected to the sensor system 6, for example via a vehicle bus, and is provided for receiving the sensor signals made available by the sensor system.  In addition, the control unit 5 is connected to the air source 1 and is
provided for controlling the air source 1.  Furthermore, the control unit 5 is connected to the modulator 7 and is provided for controlling the modulator 7.
 The air source 1, which may be a compressor of any desired design, is connected via the modulator 7 and the hose 2 to the wind deflector 3, wherein the air which is made available by the air source 1 is fed either via the modulator 7 and the
hose 2 or directly via the hose 2, as indicated by a dashed line in FIG. 1, to the wind deflector 3 and is output through the openings thereof.  The air which is output through the openings 4 of the wind deflector counteracts the air stream which enters
from the outside through the sunroof of the motor vehicle, and as a result disrupts the periodic excitation caused by the air stream entering from the outside, and therefore reduces booming noise.
 The openings 4 of the wind deflector 3 through which the air which is made available by the air source 1 is output are notches, slits, grooves or holes which are made in the wind deflector 3.
 According to a first embodiment, the device which is shown in FIG. 1 operates as follows:
 The control unit 5 receives sensor signals from the sensor system 6 which has a vehicle speed sensor.  If these sensor signals indicate that the instantaneous vehicle speed is in a predefined speed range in which booming noise occurs, the
control unit 5 activates the air source 1, insofar as the sunroof of the vehicle is open.  The air which is made available by the air source 1 is fed, either without modulation or after modulation in the modulator 7, via the hose 2 to the wind deflector
3 and is output through the openings thereof.
 In the case of modulation, the control unit 5 can influence the modulation process as a function of the instantaneous vehicle speed in such a way that the quantity of air which is output through the openings 4 is optimized in a respectively
necessary fashion.  The speed range in which booming noise occurs in the present motor vehicle was determined in advance by trials at the works as a function of the type of vehicle and was stored in a non-volatile fashion in a memory within the scope of
the fabrication of the vehicle.  During the driving operation, the control unit 5 accesses these stored data and takes them into account in the actuation of the air source 1 or of the modulator 7.
 As an alternative to this, the control unit 5 can make available a random signal for controlling the modulator 7 when the instantaneous vehicle speed is in the speed range in which booming noise occurs.
 According to a second embodiment, the device which is shown in FIG. 1 operates as follows:
 The control unit 5 receives sensor signals from the sensor system 6 which has a pressure sensor and/or a microphone.  If these sensor signals indicate that booming noise is occurring, the control unit 5 activates the air source 1, if the sunroof
of the vehicle is open.  If the sensor system 6 additionally has a speed sensor, the control unit can also take into account the output signals thereof in this evaluation of the sensor signals.  The air which is made available by the air source 1 is fed,
either without modulation or after modulation in the modulator 7, via the hose 2 to the wind deflector 3 and is output through the openings 4 thereof.
 In the case of modulation, the control unit 5 can modulate the modulation process as a function of the measured pressure, in order to optimize the quantity of air which is output through the openings, in such a way that the generation of
resonance is counteracted in a respectively necessary fashion.
 FIG. 2 shows a sketch of a specific embodiment of the air source 1 according to which a loudspeaker 8 which acts as a diaphragm pump is used as an air source.  This loudspeaker 8 is installed in a housing 9 which has non-return valves 10 and 11
in order to generate a directed air stream.  In this embodiment there is no need for separate modulation of the air stream which is made available by the loudspeaker 8, since the modulation is brought about directly by the loudspeaker 8.
 An embodiment which is not illustrated in the figures consists in implementing the air source 1 by means of an impeller wheel with a large diameter.  The air vanes of said impeller wheel are constructed in such a way that modulation of the air
stream made available by the impeller wheel can be dispensed with.  However, the rotational speed of the impeller wheel and the phase angle thereof are preferably adjusted as a function of the output signals of the sensor system 6, in order to optimize
the suppression of booming noise.  As an alternative to this, there is the possibility of positioning the blades of the impeller wheel in an arrhythmic fashion.
 In the light of the above, various embodiments relate to a device and method for reducing booming noise in a motor vehicle, which device has a wind deflector provided with openings, wherein an air source which is arranged in the motor vehicle is
provided.  This air source is connected to the wind deflector.  The air which is made available by the air source is fed to the wind deflector and output through the openings thereof.  Said air therefore counteracts occurrence of the booming noise which
is brought about by the dynamic wind or the external air stream.  The booming noise is preferably actively reduced in the sense that the control unit 5 actuates the air source 1 and/or the modulator 7 as a function of the output signals of the sensor
system 6, in order to optimize the reduction in booming noise.
 The wind deflector which is provided according to various embodiments has in its interior a cavity or ducts through which the air which is made available by the air source is transported in the interior of the wind deflector to the openings 4. 
Said wind deflector advantageously does not require any moving parts whatsoever and can be implemented with a high degree of design freedom in the form of a relatively simple, comparatively lightweight plastic component.  There is no need for any
installations at all in the wind deflector and there is also no need for lubrication.  There is advantageously no probability, or only a very slight probability, of soiling or even of blocking the openings 4, since the air does not flow from the outside
to the inside but is instead directed outward from the passenger compartment in which the air source 1 is located.

     the seat without sacrificing ride quality. The seat pedestal has a top
     carrier onto which a seat is mounted and a base that is mounted to the
     floor of a vehicle. A scissor linkage is employed to allow movement of
     the carrier toward the base when force is applied through the seat to the
     carrier when the vehicle hits bumps and forces the user downward. An air
     bag biases the top carrier upward away from the base. As the upper ends
     of the scissor linkage move closer together by being pushed upward, a
     sliding end of the scissor linkage is restrained from movement inward and
     therefore, limits the maximum height of the pedestal. The pressure in the
     air bag may be varied which will not change the height above the maximum,
     but will change the ride quality.

",,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 The invention relates generally to an air ride seat pedestal for heavy trucks, busses, RVs, and the like that includes a height adjustment that is independent of the air cushioning assembly upon which the seat is supported.
 Seats for heavy vehicles, including seats that are supported by an air ride assembly, are available in the marketplace.  Such air ride assemblies may typically include an air bag or balloon in combination with a piston/cylinder unit connected
between the base and the top of the pedestal upon which the seat is mounted.  The air bag typically provides cushioning to the seat pedestal and its occupant, while the cylinder unit is geared more toward dampening rebound forces delivered from the
ground surface upward through the vehicle's frame during travel.  To adjust the height of the seat requires the inflation or deflation of the air bag.
 The present systems using an air bag provides inadequate adjustments to accommodate various users of the seat pedestal.  To raise the height of a traditional air bag pedestal higher pressure is pumped into the air bag to raise the height.  The
maximum height that the pedestal may raise to is limited to one maximum position that corresponds to the maximum height the frame around the air bag will rise, or the maximum height is limited by the maximum extension of the air bag.  Therefore, maximum
height may mean a stiffer ride due to higher pressure in the air bag.  This may present a problem for a relatively short individual because he would have to tolerate a softer ride due to the low pressure necessary to lower the seat.  Within a traditional
seat there is not a way to limit the height of the air bag to a lower height than its maximum height, yet have the air pressure in the air bag corresponding to the maximum height.  Thus, in a traditional seat pedestal with an air bag where it is
necessary to adjust pressure to lower the height of the pedestal, a short and heavy individual may potentially bottom out the seat pedestal.  The ability to selectively lower the maximum height in the seat pedestal, independent of the pressure in the air
bag, would provide more flexibility to accommodate various users of the seat pedestal than presently available.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention is an adjustable seat pedestal that is used to cushion the ride of an occupant of a vehicle.  The pedestal has a top carrier on which a seat is mounted.  A base is mounted to the floor of the vehicle.  The first linkage,
having a lower end and an upper end, is pivotally connected to the base at its lower end.  The upper end of the first linkage is slidably connected to the top carrier.  A second linkage has a lower end and an upper end.  The upper end of the second
linkage is pivotally connected to the top carrier and the lower end of the second linkage is pivotally connected to a third linkage.  The first and second linkages are connected to each other by a pivotal connection that is located intermediate to the
end points of each of the first and second linkages.  The third linkage has an upper end that is pivotally connected to the lower end of the second linkage.  The lower end of the third linkage is pivotally connected to the base.  A stop is retained
within the top carrier, located inwardly of the upper end of the first linkage.  The stop restricts inward sliding movement of the upper end of the first linkage.  A spring biases the top carrier upward and away from the base, and this spring may be an
air bag that can be selectively pressurized to change the amount of force biasing the carrier upward.
 In another aspect of the invention, the stop may be adjustable to change the location at which the upper ends of the first linkage are stopped.  This adjustment may be done by having a threaded rod engaging a threaded nut that acts as a stop. 
The threaded rod may be turned manually or with a motor to facilitate movement of the stop. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION
 The seat pedestal 10 of the present invention is designed to provide a cushioned ride for an occupant of a vehicle in which the pedestal 10 is installed.  The pedestal 10 has a base 12 that is made to be fixed to a floor of the vehicle. 
Typically, this is bolted to the floor of the vehicle.  A top carrier 13 is supported above the base 12 with a scissor linkage 16.  The carrier 13 is designed to have a seat affixed to it and this is usually done with bolts so that a user of the pedestal
can choose a particular seat.  The scissor linkage 16 has a first linkage 18 that has a pair of opposing arms 20 that are the same length.  The first linkage 18 has an upper end 22 and a lower end 24.  At the lower end 24 of the first linkage 18, each
arm 20 has a pivotal connection to the base 12.  This connection is done with a bolt 26 held in a clevis 28 on the rearward end of the base 12, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 10.  The upper end 22 of the first linkage 18 has sliding blocks 30 that are pivotally
attached to the upper ends 22 of each arm 20.  The arms 20 are joined together with a cross member 32.  The sliding blocks 30 are T-shaped and are adapted for riding in a C-channel 31.
 A second linkage 36 of the scissor linkage 16 has an upper end 38 and a lower end 44.  The upper end 38 is pivotally connected to the carrier 13 with bolt 39.  The lower end 44 is pivotally connected to a third linkage 43.  Between the upper end
38 and lower end 44 of the second linkage 36, it is pivotally connected to the first linkage 18.  The second linkage 36 pivots about apertures 46 when it is connected to the first linkage 18.  Bolt 48 pivotally connects the first and second linkages 18,
36.  Apertures 46 are located on opposite sides of the second linkage 42 and each receive a bolt 48.  The third linkage 43 has its upper end 50 pivotally connected to the lower end 44 of the second linkage 36.  A lower end 54 of the third linkage is
pivotally connected to a forward end of the base 12.
 A carriage 58 is pivotally connected to the first linkage 18 and spans across to each upper end 22 of each arm 20.  The carriage 58 is connected inside the arms 20, opposite the sliding blocks 30.  The carriage 58 has guide holes 60 that are
adapted for receiving guide rods 62 that are affixed to a forward flange 66 of the top carrier 13.  A central hole 68 has an inner diameter that is larger than a threaded rod 70 that passes through the carriage 58.  The carriage 58 moves as the first
linkage 18 moves relative to the top carrier 13.  This movement occurs when the top carrier 13 moves nearer or farther from the base 12.  The threaded rod 70 is longitudinally fixed to the forward flange 66 and is rotatable within the flange 66.
 The treaded threaded rod 70 is connected to a threaded nut 72 that acts as a stop.  The threaded nut 72 limits the inward travel of the carriage 58, and thus limits the inward movement of the upper ends 22 of the arms, and sliding blocks 30.  A
knob 80 attached to the threaded rod 70 may be used to rotate the rod 70 and move the location of the threaded nut 72.  As shown in FIG. 3, the upper ends 22, and carriage 58 are in their most inwardly available position due to being stopped by the nut
72.  A rubber washer 82 is located adjacent to nut 72 to prevent metal to metal contact as the carriage 58 is stopped by the nut 72.  Rotating the knob 80 moves the nut 72 and changes the maximum inward position of the upper ends 22.  The nut 72 has
bolts 86 extending upward from it that ride in slots 88 in the carrier 13.  Plastic washers 90 on the bolts 86 provide a low friction connection to the carrier 13 so the nut 72 may slide relatively easily relative to the carrier 13 when the adjustment
knob 80 is turned.
 An air bag 92 acts as a spring urging the carrier 13 away from the base 12.  The bag 92 is attached to the cross member 32 and to the carrier 13.  The air bag 92 extends through an aperture 93 in the second linkage 36.  The bag 92 may be
selectively filled to a desired pressure that will correspond to a larger force urging the carrier upward with higher pressure, and a lower force urging the carrier upward with lower pressure.  A gas spring 94 may be added to urge the second 36 linkage
upward, and therefore urge the carrier upward.  The gas spring 94 will provide a more constant force over its change in length than either an air bag 92 or a conventional coil spring.  Its position is shown in FIG. 10, but it is not necessary to have the
gas spring 94 because the air bag 92 can provide sufficient force to support the carrier 13 and an occupant seated on a seat mounted to the carrier 13.  A damper 98 is connected to the first linkage 18 to provide damping of movement during travel of the
vehicle.  Excessive movement would cause irritating bouncing for a user of the seat attached to the pedestal 10.
 Weight or force exerted upon the carrier 13 through a seat that is attached to it will cause movement within the scissor linkage 16 in a controlled manner.  Force exerted downwardly on the carrier will move the upper ends 22 of the first linkage
18 away from the upper ends 38 of the second linkage 36.  This will cause the carriage 58 to slide smoothly along its guide rods 62 as well as cause the slide blocks 30 to slide within their respective C-channels 31.  Downward movement of the carrier 13
toward the base 12 will also cause the lower ends 44, 24 of the second linkage 36 and first linkage 18 respectively to move apart.  Since the lower end 24 of the first linkage 18 is pivotally attached to the base 12 it cannot move laterally, it is the
lower end 44 of the second linkage 36 that pivotally moves with the upper end 50 of the third linkage 43 to facilitate lateral movement.  It is this accurate movement that allows the lower ends 44, 24 to move apart laterally as necessary to facilitate
near parallel movement of the carrier 13 relative to the base 12.  During this movement the nut 72 remains in its position and it is the carriage 58 that moves away from the nut 72.  The guide rods 62 and slide blocks 30 provide a complementary guidance
to the upper ends 22 so that binding does not occur due to parts camming into each other.  The fact that all of the other connections in the scissor linkage 16 other than slide blocks 30 are pivotal allows the forward most edge 63 of the base to be
located rearward of where it otherwise would be if sliding connections were used at both forward most connections on the carrier 13 and base 12.
 FIG. 3 shows the carrier 13 at its maximum height above the base 12.  This corresponds the bolts 86 being moved to their maximum inward positions within the slots 88.  The carriage rests against the rubber washer 82 which is stopped against the
threaded nut 72.  FIG. 4 is a sectional view of this same position.  In the position shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the air bag 92 has fully biased the carrier 13 upward.  FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate what will happen when force is put on the carrier 13 that is
sufficient to overcome the biasing force of the air bag 92.  This force can come from the weight of the occupant or could be the intermittent force from the occupant resulting from the vehicle hitting a bump.  The carriage 58 is connected to the upper
ends and will move outward with the upper ends 22 and away from the threaded nut 72 when the carrier 13 is forced downward.  The carriage 58 may be forced downward until it reaches the forward flange 66, which stops further outward movement and defines
the lowest possible height the carrier 13 will be above the base 12.  FIGS. 7 and 8 show the lowest possible height of the pedestal.  The difference between the height of the carrier 13 in FIGS. 3, 4 and FIGS. 7,8 is the maximum travel of the seat
pedestal.  FIG. 9 shows threaded nut 72 being adjusted outwardly or more near the forward flange 66 than in FIGS. 3-8.  This limits the maximum height that the carrier 13 may be above the base 12 to a lower height than that of FIGS. 3-8.  Downward force
on the carrier 13 will move the carriage 58 away from the threaded nut 72 in the same fashion as that which occurs in FIGS. 3-8, but the overall range will be less than that of FIGS. 3-8.
 In use, the pedestal 10 offers a great amount of adjustability to choose desired ride characteristics without changing the pedestal 10 itself.  The full height of the carrier 13 above the base, or the seat height is determined by adjusting the
adjustment knob 80 to move the nut 72.  This adjustment may be manually done through the use of a knob 80, or could potentially be done by the use of a motor.  FIGS. 3 and 4 show the seat at full height with no weight upon the seat.  This position could
also be the position in which too little weight is put upon the seat and carrier 13 to push the carrier 13 downward.  In this configuration, the air bag 92 pushes upwardly on the carrier 13 and thus moves the sliding upper ends 22 of arms 20 inward
toward the center of the carrier 13.  The ends 22 are connected to the carriage 58 so the carriage 58 moves inwardly with the ends 22 and the nut 72 limits the inward movement of the carriage 58.  The nut 72 will prevent inward movement of the carriage
58 no matter what pressure is put into the air bag 92.  If a vehicle occupant wishes to have a hard ride in which it would take a great deal of force to push the seat and carrier 13 downward, more air pressure will be put into the bag 92.  FIGS. 5 and 6
correspond to a position where enough weight or force has been placed upon the carrier 13 so that the carrier 13 has been forced downward toward the base 12.  As can be seen in FIGS. 5 and 6, the nut 72 is located in the same position relative to the
forward flange 66 as it was in FIGS. 3 and 4, but the carriage 58 has moved outward relative to the nut 72.  This movement will occur when the vehicle hits a bump and the carrier 13 moves to cushion the occupant.  The maximum amount the carrier 13 can
move downward is until the carriage 58 is stopped against the forward flange 66, and this may never happen if the air bag 92 is pumped with air of sufficient pressure.  If the air bag 92 is pumped with a great amount of pressure, the force required to
move the carrier 13 downward and the carriage 58 outward may be so high that under ordinary circumstances during vehicle travel, the carrier 13 and seat attached to it do not move downward.  This would correspond to an extremely hard ride setting.
 The pedestal 10 of the present invention allows adjustment not possible with just an air bag.  In the prior art, simply using an air bag for more height required more air pressure.  Lower height required less air pressure.  This would mean a
shorter vehicle occupant, who would use a traditional seat, would have to tolerate a softer ride because the low pressure in the air bag would provide that.  In the case of the present invention, a shorter occupant who would like a harder ride could
adjust the nut 72 into a position corresponding to a relatively near distance to the forward flange 66 and then he could pressurize the air bag 92 to a high level of pressure for a firm ride at low height.  This could also be a benefit to a shorter
heavier user of the seat because with the present invention the higher pressure in the air bag 92 could prevent bottoming out.  In the past, high pressure might put the pedals out of reach for a shorter individual.  As such, the present invention makes
it possible to accommodate different weight and sized people to an extent that was not possible before without having to change out the seat pedestal 10 itself.
 The present invention is not limited to the details given above, but may be modified within the scope of the following claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 Embodiments are hereinafter described in detail in connection with the views of FIGS. 1-8, 9A-9C, and 10A-10C, wherein like numbers indicate the same or corresponding elements throughout the views.  A vehicle includes a utility bed which can be
used to facilitate hauling of cargo by the vehicle.  In one embodiment, the vehicle can be a dump-type vehicle having a utility bed that can facilitate selective dumping of cargo from the utility bed.  In other embodiments, a dump-type vehicle can
comprise any of a variety of other types of vehicles having a utility bed capable of dumping (e.g., a dump bed) such as, for example, a pickup truck, a dump truck, an all terrain vehicle (""ATV""), and a golf cart, for example.  In another embodiment, the
vehicle can include a non-dump type vehicle having a utility bed that is rigidly fixed to the vehicle's frame (e.g., a non-dumpable bed).  A non-dump-type vehicle can comprise a light utility vehicle, such as a utility vehicle 10 shown in FIGS. 1-8.  In
yet another embodiment, the vehicle can include a trailer.
 Referring again to FIGS. 1-8, the utility vehicle 10 can include a vehicular frame 12.  The vehicular frame 12 can include any of a variety of structural and/or decorative rails, panels, and/or other components which are typically, although not
necessarily, formed from metal (e.g., steel and/or aluminum.  A pair of rear wheels 13 can be rotatably coupled with the vehicular frame 12.  The utility vehicle 10 can define a longitudinally extending axis A1 that extends between a front end and a rear
end of the utility vehicle.
 A front left seat 14 and a front right seat 16 can each be supported by the vehicular frame 12 and can facilitate support of occupants within the vehicle's passenger compartment 18.  The utility vehicle 10 can also include a utility bed 20 which
is rigidly coupled with the vehicular frame 12.  In an alternative embodiment, a utility vehicle can include a utility bed which is coupled with the vehicular frame either directly or indirectly, and such as through use of a hinge assembly.  The hinge
assembly can facilitate pivotable movement of the utility bed 20 with respect to the vehicular frame 12 of the utility vehicle 10, and between a hauling position and a dumping position.  It will be appreciated that any of a variety of known conventional
mechanisms or methods (none shown) can be provided to facilitate manual or powered movement of the utility bed 20 between the hauling and dumping positions under control of an operator of the utility vehicle 10.
 In the embodiment of FIGS. 1-8, the utility bed 20 is shown to comprise a bed floor 22.  The utility bed 20 is also shown to include a left side wall 24 and a right side wall 26 extending generally perpendicularly from the bed floor 22 or
generally perpendicularly from locations adjacent to the bed floor 22.  The utility bed 20 can also include end walls such as a front wall 28 and a tailgate 30, as illustrated in FIGS. 1-8.  In one embodiment, the tailgate 30 can be pivotally coupled
with respect to the bed floor 22.  In another embodiment, a tailgate can be coupled with the bed floor 22 as shown and described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,735,894, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.  The left side wall 24, the right
side wall 26, and the front wall 28 can cooperate with the bed floor 22 to retain cargo within the utility bed 20.  The tailgate 30, when closed (as shown in FIGS. 1-6), can also cooperate with the left side wall 24, the right side wall 26, and the bed
floor 22 to retain cargo within the utility bed 20.  It will be appreciated that the tailgate 30 can be selectively opened to facilitate loading and/or unloading of the utility bed 20 from the rear of the vehicle 10.  In another embodiment, it will be
appreciated that a rear wall can be provided in lieu of a tailgate with the rear wall being rigidly affixed with respect to a bed floor of a utility bed such that it might not be capable of being selectively opened by an operator.  In yet another
alternative embodiment, it will be appreciated that one or more side walls (e.g., 24 and/or 26) of a utility bed might be capable of being selectively opened (e.g., like tailgate 30) by an operator.  In still another alternative embodiment, it will be
appreciated that a utility bed might not include any tailgate and/or side walls and might, for example, comprise a flat-bed type configuration (e.g., commonly used for hauling small vehicles).
 As illustrated in FIGS. 1-3, the left sidewall 24 can include a left door 32 and a left rear sidewall portion 34.  The right sidewall 26 can include a right door 36 and a right rear sidewall portion 38.  The left and right doors 32, 36 can each
be pivotable between a closed position (FIG. 2) and an opened position (FIG. 3).  When in the closed position, each of the left and right doors 32, 36 can cooperate with the bed floor 22, the front wall 28, and the remaining portions of the left and
right rear sidewall portions 34, 38 to retain cargo within the utility bed 20.  When the left and right doors 32, 36 are moved to the opened position, the left and right rear sidewall portions 34, 38 can remain upright such that left and right openings
40, 42 (FIG. 3) are defined.
 The left and right sidewalls 24, 26 and the left and right doors 32, 36 can be configured to ensure that the utility bed 20 maintains proper aesthetics when the left and right doors 32, 36 are in the closed positions.  As illustrated in FIGS. 1
and 3, the left and right sidewalls 24, 26 can each define a respective lower horizontally extending portion 44, 46, and the left and right doors 32, 36 can include respective protruding portions 45, 47.  When the left and right doors 32, 36 are in their
respective closed positions, the lower horizontally extending portions 44, 46 can cooperate with the protruding portions 45, 47 to give the appearance of substantially continuous left and right sidewalls 24, 26.
 In one embodiment, a seal can be provided along the perimeter of each of the left and right doors 32, 36.  Each seal can facilitate selective sealing of the interaction between the doors 32, 36, the respective rear sidewall portion 34, 38, and
the lower horizontally extending portion 44, 46 of the left and right sidewall 24, 26.  In one embodiment, the left and right doors 32, 36 can each include a manually-operated handle (e.g., 48, 50) that facilitates selective securing of the respective
door (e.g., 32, 36) in the closed position.
 As illustrated in FIG. 2, the bed floor 22 can include a front floor 52 and a rear floor 54.  The left and right doors 32, 36 can be pivotally attached to the front floor 52 such that, when the left and right doors 32, 36 are in the opened
position, they can each lie substantially parallel with and against the front floor 52.  In one embodiment, the left and right doors 32, 36 can be pivotally coupled with the front floor 52 with respective pairs of hinges 56, 57 (shown in FIGS. 1 and 2). 
In other embodiments, however, left and right doors can be movably coupled with a bed floor in any of a variety of suitable alternative arrangements.
 As illustrated in FIG. 4, with the left and right doors 32, 36 in the opened position, the front floor 52 can pivot with respect to the rear floor 54 from a cargo support position (FIGS. 2 and 3) to an opened position (FIG. 4).  In one
embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. 4-6, with the front floor 52 in the opened position, the front and rear floors 52, 54 can define an acute angle.  As illustrated in FIG. 4, the utility bed 20 can include a bed frame 58 that at least partially
underlies the bed floor 22.  The bed frame 58 can comprise a tubular frame structure that extends underneath the bed floor 22 to provide underlying support for the bed floor 22, the left and right sidewalls 24, 26, and/or the front wall 28.  It will be
appreciated that a bed frame can be provided in any of a variety of suitable alternative arrangements.  For example, a bed frame might be integrally formed as part of a bed floor such as in a one-piece bed floor/bed frame configuration.
 The front floor 52 is shown in FIGS. 4-6 to be pivotally attached to the rear floor 54 with a hinge 59 to facilitate pivoting of the front floor 52 between the cargo support position and the opened position.  In other embodiments, however, it
will be appreciated that a front floor can be movably coupled with a bed frame in any of a variety of suitable alternative arrangements.  For example, a front floor can be pivotally attached directly to a bed frame.  In another example, a front floor can
be removable from the bed frame to facilitate manual positioning of the front floor in the cargo support position or seating position.  It will be appreciated that any of a variety of known conventional mechanisms or methods (none shown) can be provided
to facilitate manual or powered movement of a front floor between the cargo support position and the opened position.  For example, a front floor can include a selectively concealable handle (not shown) which can be grasped by a user to manually move the
front floor between the opened and cargo support positions.  In another embodiment, an electronic linear actuator can be coupled with each of a rear floor and the bed frame to facilitate powered movement of the front floor.
 In one embodiment, the rear floor 54 can be fixed with respect to the bed frame 58 such as through welded attachment.  However, in other embodiments, the rear floor 54 can be pivotally or otherwise movably attached to the bed frame 58.  For
example, the rear floor 54 can be pivotally attached to the bed frame 58 to facilitate selective access to the area underlying the utility bed 20 (e.g., facilitating access to the bed frame 58).  It will be appreciated however, a bed floor can be
provided in any of a variety of suitable alternative arrangements.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 1-3, the utility bed 20 can include left and right locking mechanisms 60, 62 that can be configured to selectively retain the front floor 52 in the opened position.  The left and right locking mechanisms 60, 62 can be
associated with respective left and right sidewalls 24, 26 to facilitate retention of the front floor 52 in the opened position.  In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the left and right locking mechanisms 60, 62 can include a pair of latches (64
shown in FIGS. 2-4, 66 shown in FIG. 1) that are operably coupled with a respective handle 68, 70.  Each pair of latches 64, 66 can correspond with a respective pair of receptacles (e.g., 72 shown in FIG. 3) defined by the left and right doors 32, 36. 
When the front floor 52 is in the opened position, the latches 64, 66 can extend into corresponding receptacles (e.g., 72) to retain the front floor 52 in the opened position.  Rotation of the handles 68, 70 can retract the latches 64, 66 to release the
front floor 52 from the opened position.  In one embodiment, the latches 64, 66 can be biased to an extended position (e.g., with springs) and can be moved to a retracted position when contacted by the front floor 52 as it moves into the opened position
(e.g., similar to a conventional setback latch arrangement found on a conventional house door).
 As illustrated in FIGS. 4-6, the front wall 28 can be slideably coupled with the bed frame 58 such that the front wall 28 is slidable between a cargo hauling position (FIG. 4) and a seating position (FIG. 6).  In one embodiment, as illustrated
in FIG. 7, the utility bed 20 can include left and right slide rails 74, 75 that extend substantially parallel with the longitudinally extending axis A1 of the utility vehicle 10.  The left and right slide rails 74, 75 can each include an inner member
(e.g., 76) that is slideably supported by an outer member (e.g., 78), such as with bearings (not shown), for example.  The inner members (e.g., 76) of the left and right side rails 74, 75 can be coupled with respective left and right sides of the front
wall 28 (e.g., with bolts or through welded attachment).  The outer member (e.g., 78) of each left and right slide rail 74, 75 can be coupled with the respective left and right side walls 24, 26 below the respective left and right openings 40, 42 (e.g.,
attached to the lower horizontally extending members 44, 46), such as with bolts (not shown), for example.  The front wall 28 can thus extend between, and can be substantially transverse to, the left and right rails 74, 75.  The inner members (e.g., 76)
of the slide rails 74, 75 can slide with respect to the outer rails (e.g., 78) to facilitate sliding of the front wall 28 between the cargo hauling position (FIG. 4) and the seating position (FIG. 6).  In another embodiment, a pair of slide rails can be
attached directly to a bed frame (e.g., 58).  It will be appreciated that, any of a variety of other suitable slideable arrangements can facilitate slideable coupling of a front wall, directly or indirectly, with a bed frame.
 When the front floor 52 is in the cargo support position, the front floor 52 can overlie the left and right slide rails 74, 75 and can prevent the front wall 28 from moving to the seating position.  When the front floor 52 is in the opened
position, the front wall 28 is permitted to move to the seating position.  With the front wall 28 in the seating position, the front floor 52 can be positioned adjacent to, and rearward of, the front wall 28.
 In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 5, the front wall 28 can include a handle 80.  The handle 80 can accommodate a user's hand to facilitate manual movement of the front wall 28 between the cargo hauling position and the seating position. 
Although the handle 80 is shown to be a recess, it will be appreciated that any of a variety of suitable alternative handle configurations can be provided, such as a U-shaped handle.  It will also be appreciated that any of a variety of known
conventional mechanisms or methods (none shown) can be provided to facilitate powered movement of a front wall between the cargo hauling position and the seating position.  For example, an electronic linear actuator can be coupled with each of the front
wall and the bed frame to facilitate powered movement of the front wall.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 1-8, the vehicle 10 can include a seat bottom portion 82 pinned directly to the front wall 28.  As illustrated in FIG. 8, the seat bottom portion 82 can include a base portion 84 that includes a plurality of female hinge
members 86.  The front wall 28 can include a plurality of male hinge members 88.  Each of the male hinge members 88 can be pivotally coupled together with one of the female hinge members 86 with a respective pin 90.  The seat bottom portion 82 can thus
pivot with respect to the front wall 28 about an axis A2 (FIG. 7) that extends through the male and female hinge members 86, 88 (e.g., through front wall 28).  It will be appreciated that a seat bottom portion can be pinned directly to a front wall in
any of a variety of suitable alternative configurations.  It will also be appreciated that, in other embodiments, a seat bottom portion can be pivotally coupled with a front wall in a variety of other suitable alternative configurations such as for
example, with hinges.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 4-6, when the front wall 28 is slid rearwardly (e.g., from the cargo hauling position to the seating position), the seat bottom portion 82 is pivotable from a stored position (FIGS. 2-4) to a seating position (FIG. 6). 
When in the stored position the seat bottom portion 82 can reside in a foot well 99 in a vertical orientation beneath the front wall 28.  As illustrated in FIGS. 4-6, a pair of seat backs 92 can be coupled with the front wall 28 and a pair of seat
bottoms 94 can be coupled with the base portion 84 of the seat bottom portion 82.  When the front wall 28 is moved to the seating position, the seat bottom portion 82 can be pivoted into the seating position such that it no longer resides in the foot
well 99.  When the front wall 28 and the seat bottom portion 82 are in their seating positions, as illustrated in FIG. 6, the seat backs 92 and seat bottoms 94 can cooperate to provide left and right rear seats 96, 98 and the foot well 99 can accommodate
legs of passengers seated upon the left or right rear seats 96, 98.
 When in the stored position, the seat bottom portion 82 can be partially obscured from plain sight by the utility bed 20.  In addition, since the seat bottom portion 82 is located in front of the rear wheels 13, the vertical space beneath the
utility bed can more effectively accommodate a rear suspension, rear axle, and/or rear wheels.  For example, if the seat bottom portion were stored horizontally beneath a front floor, the height and travel of shock absorbers might need to be reduced to
accommodate for the limited vertical space occupied by the bed floor portion.
 The front wall 28 and the seat bottom portion 82, when in their seating positions, can be releasably coupled with the sidewalls (e.g., 24, 26) and the bed frame 58, respectively.  In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 6, the front wall 28
and the bed floor portion 82 can be secured to the left and right rear sidewall portions 34, 38 with detent members 100.  The right rear sidewall portion 38 can define a pair of apertures 102 (FIG. 3) and the lower horizontally extending portion 46 of
the right sidewall 26 can define an aperture 106.  When the front wall 28 is in the seating position, a pair of the detent members 100 can be provided through respective apertures 102 of the right rear sidewall portion 38 and into apertures 104 defined
by the front wall 28 (e.g., in an interference fit) to secure the front wall 28 to the right rear sidewall portion 38.  Similarly, when the seat bottom portion 82 is in the seating position, one of the detent members 100 can be provided through the
aperture 106 in the lower horizontally extending portion 46 of the right rear sidewall portion 38 and into an aperture 108 defined by the seat bottom portion 82 (e.g., in an interference fit) to secure the seat bottom portion 82 to the right rear
sidewall portion 38.  Left sides of the front wall 28 and the seat bottom portion 82 can be secured to the left rear sidewall portion 34 in a similar manner.  It will be appreciated that a front wall and/or seat bottom portion can be releasably secured
in a seating position in any of a variety of suitable alternative arrangements such as with latches or through electrical constraint of a motorized linear actuator coupled between the front wall and bed frame, for example.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 4-7, the vehicular frame 12 can include longitudinal frame members 109 that extend substantially parallel with the longitudinally extending axis A1 and from beneath the utility bed 20 toward the front seats 14, 16.  The
configuration of the longitudinal frame members 109 can provide access to the foot well 99 that might otherwise be obstructed by a conventional vehicular frame.  For example, a conventional vehicular frame might extend entirely beneath the left and right
sidewalls 34, 38 and thus obstruct passenger access to the foot well 99 when the rear seats, 96, 98 are deployed.  Such a conventional vehicular frame might require a passenger to climb over the vehicular frame when embarking or disembarking to/from the
rear seats 96, 98.  In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8, the bed floor portion 82 can be provided in a substantially U-shaped configuration.  When the seat bottom portion 82 is in the stored position, the seat bottom portion 82 can
accommodate the longitudinal frame members 109 between the seat bottoms 94.  It will be appreciated that a vehicular frame and/or a bed frame can be provided in any of a variety of configurations that accommodate passenger access to a foot well when rear
seats are deployed.  It will also be appreciated that a seat bottom portion can be provided in any of a variety of suitable configurations to accommodate passage of a vehicular frame and/or bed frame from beneath a utility bed toward front seats.
 In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 7, the vehicular frame 12 can include a pair of lateral frame members 110 that are coupled with the longitudinal frame members 109.  The lateral frame members 110 can extend transversely to the
longitudinally extending axis A1.  During sliding of the front wall 28 to the seating position, the lateral frame members 110 contact a bottom surface (112 in FIG. 3) of the seat bottom portion 82 to pivot the seat bottom portion 82 towards the seating
position.  The lateral frame members 110 can thus effectively guide the seat bottom portion 82 into the seating position when the front wall 28 is slid from the cargo hauling position to the seating position.  For example, as illustrated in FIG. 9A, the
lateral frame members 110 can be disposed at least partially beneath the utility bed 20 and rearward of the front wall 28, when the front wall 28 is in the cargo hauling position.  With the front wall 28 in the cargo hauling position and the seat bottom
portion 82 in the stored position, the seat bottom portion 82 can be spaced longitudinally from the lateral frame members 110 and a wheel well wall 116, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 9A.  As illustrated in FIG. 9B, as the front wall 28 moves toward the seating
position, the seat bottom portion 82 can contact the lateral frame members 110 and the wheel well wall 116.  As the front wall 28 continues to move rearwardly toward the seating position, the seat bottom portion 82 rides along the lateral frame members
110 and the wheel well wall 116 such that the lateral frame members 110 and wheel well wall 116 can facilitate pivoting of the seat bottom portion 82 into the seating position.  As illustrated in FIG. 9C, when the front wall 28 and the seat bottom
portion 82 are in the seating position, the lateral frame members 110 can provide underlying support for the seat bottom portion 82.  In one embodiment, the lateral frame members 110 can cooperate with the detent members (e.g., 100 in FIG. 6) to support
the seat bottom portion 82 with respect to the bed frame 58.
 It will be appreciated that a variety of suitable alternative support structures can facilitate pivoting of the seat bottom portion 82 into a seating position when the front wall 28 is moved to the seating position.  In one alternative
embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 10A, a utility bed 1020 can include a wheel well wall 1116 that is disposed beneath the utility bed 1020 without any intervening lateral frame members (e.g., 110) between the wheel well wall 1116 and the utility bed
1020.  As illustrated in FIG. 10B, as a front wall 1028 moves into a seating position, a seat bottom portion 1082 contacts the wheel well wall 1116.  As the front wall 1020 continues to slide rearwardly, the seat bottom portion 1082 rides along the wheel
well wall 1116 such that the wheel well wall 1116 facilitates pivoting of the seat bottom portion 1082 into the seating position.  As illustrated in FIG. 10C, when the front wall 1028 and the seat bottom portion 1082 are in the seating position, the
wheel well wall 1116 can provide underlying support for the seat bottom portion 1082.
 It will be appreciated that a support structure can include any of a variety of components and/or any of a variety of materials.  For example, a support structure can be overlaid with an elastomeric material.  It will also be appreciated that in
some embodiments, a support structure might not underlie the utility bed to facilitate pivoting to a seat bottom portion into seating position.  In these embodiments, the seat bottom portion might be pivoted into a seating position manually or through
automation (e.g., with a linear motor) and independent of movement of the front wall 28.
 It will be appreciated, that although the embodiment of FIGS. 1-8 illustrates forward facing rear seats 96, 98 which are disposed towards a rearmost portion of the utility bed 20, rear seats can be provided on a utility bed in any of a variety
of suitable alternative arrangements.  In one embodiment, the rear wall can be configured to provide rearward facing seats disposed at a frontmost portion of the utility bed.  The rear wall of the utility bed can include seat backs and can be slideably
coupled with the bed frame.  A seat bottom portion can include seat bottoms and can be pivotally coupled with the rear wall.  Sliding the rear wall into a seating position pivots the seat bottom portion into a seating position such that the seat backs
cooperate with the seat bottoms to define rearwardly facing left and right rear seats.  In such an embodiment, the left and right side walls may or may not include respective left and right side doors since the rear seats can be accessed from the rear of
the vehicle.
 Although the embodiments above have been described with respect to individual left and right rear seats, it will be appreciated that in other embodiments the utility bed can include more than two rear seats or less than two rear seats.  In yet
another embodiment, the utility bed can provide left and right seats that can be deployed independent of each other.  In such an embodiment, a front wall can be bifurcated into left and right portions.  A seat back can be coupled with each left and right
portion of the front wall.  A seat bottom portion can be similarly bifurcated into left and right portions.  A seat bottom can be coupled with each left and right portion.  In such an arrangement, left and right rear seats can be individually and
selectively erected from the utility bed.  It will also be appreciated that rear seats can be provided along a utility bed in any of a variety of suitable alternative arrangements.  For example, rear seats can be rigidly affixed to a bed floor of a
utility bed.
 While various embodiments of a vehicle have been illustrated by the foregoing description and have been described in detail with respect to FIGS. 1-8, 9A-9C, and 10A-10C, it is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the scope of the appended
claims to such detail.  Numerous modifications are possible in light of the above teachings.  Some of those modifications have been discussed and others will be understood by those skilled in the art.

SUMMERY OF THE INVENTION
Problem that the Invention is to Solve
 In the vehicle instrument panel, there is also installed a front passenger seat airbag device with a specific serial code carried thereon.  In some cases, the serial code SC is read after the instrument panel IP with the glove box 1 is mounted
into the vehicle on a factory assembly line.  The glove box, once installed in the instrument panel, therefore, has had to be removed from the instrument panel for the reading of the serial code.
 The present invention has been made to solve the above problem, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle glove box that enables easy reading of a serial code on an airbag device.
Means for Solving the Problem
 The present invention provides a vehicle glove box installed in a vehicle instrument panel and comprising a storage unit for having goods to be stored therein, the storage unit including an opening and a lid for opening and closing the opening,
the opening being formed to face both an air conditioner filter and a serial code of an airbag.
 The above configuration, in which the opening is formed in the location facing not only the air conditioner filter but also the serial code of the airbag, enables easy reading of the serial code of the airbag device by opening the lid.
 It is preferable that the storage unit has a hole and the lid has a fit portion for fitting in the hole, the fit portion fitting in the hole for the lid to be held on the storage unit with the lid in an opened state thereof.
 The above configuration prevents the lid from dropping off from the storage unit and thereby from being lost.
 Further, it is preferable that the opening is formed in a position from a front face of the storage unit to an upper face thereof.
 The above configuration allows easy replacement of the air conditioner filter which, in general, is installed in front of the front face of the vehicle glove box.  Further, the above configuration allows easy reading of the serial code of the
airbag which, in general, is located above the upper face of the vehicle glove box.
 Moreover, it is preferable that the fit portion is formed on a lower edge of the lid.
 The above configuration allows gravity to keep the fit portion fitting in the hole formed through the storage unit, so that the lid stays out of the way of replacement of the filter and reading of the serial code.

 <Use Example>
 Now, description will be made of a use example of the vehicle glove box 1 according to the embodiment with reference of FIGS. 4A-5B.  FIGS. 4A and 4B are views showing the closed state of the second lid; a view in which the second lid is seen
from the rear of the vehicle (FIG. 4A) and a cross sectional view in which the second lid is seen from a right side thereof (FIG. 4B).  FIGS. 5A and 5B are views showing the opened state of the second lid; a view in which the second lid is seen from the
rear of the vehicle (FIG. 5A) and a cross sectional view in which the second lid is seen from the right side thereof (FIG. 5B).  In FIGS. 4A-5B, the first lid 20 is in its opened state, and illustration of the guide portion 11 d and the damper unit 30 is
omitted.
 As shown in FIG. 4B, according to the vehicle of the embodiment, the instrument panel IP has an air conditioner filter F and a front-passenger seat airbag device AB installed therein.  The filter F is configured to be detachable for the
replacement thereof.  The airbag device AB has a rear face with a serial code SC thereon.  In general, the filter F is installed in front of the front face 11f of the vehicle glove box 1.  The serial code SC of the airbag device AB is located above the
front edge of the upper face 11u of the vehicle glove box 1.  In other words, the second opening 11b of the storage unit 11 is formed to face both the air conditioner filter F and the serial code SC of the airbag device AB.
 <<At Normal Times>>
 As shown in FIG. 4A, the second lid 40 is closed at normal times.  That is, as shown in FIG. 4B, the hook portions 42 of the second lid 40 are inserted through the holes 11c, and the tabs 43 are engaged with the upper edge of the second opening
11b.  In this state, the filter F and the airbag device AB are invisible from a vehicle passenger, and the vehicle passenger is able to store goods into the vehicle glove box 1.
 <<At the Time of Replacing the Filter F and Reading of the Serial Code SC>>
 As shown in FIG. 5A, the second lid 40 is opened at the time of replacing the filter F and reading of the serial code SC.  That is, as shown in FIG. 5B, the vehicle passenger or a vehicle worker opens the first lid 20, and then elastically
deforms the tabs 43 of the second lid 40 to get the tabs 43 out of the engagement with the upper end of the second opening 11b and to open the second lid 40.  In this state, the filter F and the airbag device AB are visible through the first opening 11a
and the second opening 11b from the vehicle passenger so that the vehicle passenger or worker can replace the filter F or read the serial code SC with a reader R.
 In the meanwhile, reading of the serial code SC is carried out after mounting of the instrument panel IP with the glove box 1 therein into the vehicle on a factory assembly line.  Data obtained by the reading of the serial code SC is stored into
a computer's memory in relation to the number of the vehicle.
 During the reading of the serial code SC, the second lid 40 is held on the body part 11 of the storage unit 10 by the hook portions 42 thereof pressing on peripheral areas of the respective holes 11b.  Thus, according to the vehicle glove box 1
of the embodiment, the second lid 40 will not drop off from the body part 11 of the storage unit 10, which prevents loss of the second lid 40.
 Further, according to the vehicle glove box 1 of the embodiment, at the time of replacing the filter F and reading of the serial code SC, the vehicle passenger or worker turns the lid 40 using the hook portions 42 as a pivot to open the lid 40,
and after the replacement of the filter F or the reading of the serial code SC, turns the lid 40 back in position using the hook portions 42 as a pivot to close the lid 40.  Thus, it is easy to open and close the second lid 40.
 Moreover, according to the vehicle glove box 1 of the embodiment, the second lid 40 is turned with the lower edge used as a pivotal axis.  In the opened state of the second lid 40, gravity keeps the hook portions 42 fitting in the holes 11c
formed through the body part 11 of the storage unit 10, so that the second lid 40 stays out of the way of replacement of the filter F and reading of the serial code SC.
 While an embodiment has been described referring to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto and that variations and changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the
invention.  For example, the location of the second opening 11b may be changed properly according to the configuration of the filter F and the serial code SC.  Further, the instrument panel IP may have any shape that allows replacement of the filter F
and reading of the serial code SC with the vehicle glove box 1 installed therein and with the first lid 20 and the second lid 40 both opened.

 The invention relates to integral power tailgate and wiper actuation in a vehicle.
BACKGROUND
 Vehicles that have the capacity to transport substantial amounts of cargo have experienced consistent consumer demand.  Such vehicles typically have a relatively large body opening so that objects which would not fit through the traditional door
openings could be loaded into the cargo area.  The cargo opening is frequently positioned in the aft-end of the vehicle body, and in many cases the closure design comprises a hinged door or tailgate for convenient access.
 Typically, such a tailgate includes a window to facilitate a view for the vehicle's occupants to the rear of the vehicle.  Frequently, the tailgate also incorporates a wiper for maintaining the occupants' rear view through the window.
 The tailgate may be hinged for pivotable movement along the aft-end of the subject vehicle's roof or at the aft-end of the vehicle's body sides.  Such pivotable attachment of the tailgate to the body of the vehicle permits the tailgate to swing
up and/or away for loading or unloading cargo.  The tailgate may include a drive mechanism for selectively swinging the tailgate up and/or away from or toward the access opening.  The drive mechanism may be actuated by a tailgate mounted device or by a
remote controller to either gain or restrict access to the interior of the vehicle.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like components, FIG. 1 shows an actuating system 10 included in a vehicle body 12.  The vehicle body 12 encloses an interior space that is adapted to accommodate vehicle
passengers and their belongings.  As shown, the vehicle body 12 includes a rear portion 14 that defines an access opening 16.  Besides the rear portion 14, the vehicle body 12 also includes a front portion, the existence of which, although not shown,
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.
 The vehicle body 12 also includes a tailgate 18.  The tailgate 18 is power operated to selectively open and close, to thereby respectively cover and uncover the access opening 16 and selectively permit and restrict access to the vehicle's
interior space.  The tailgate 18 is of the type that is frequently used for access to the interiors and storage compartments in vans, station wagons, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).
 The actuating system 10 includes a first actuator 20 and a second actuator 26.  The first actuator 20 and the second actuator 26 operatively connect the tailgate 18 to the vehicle body 12.  The first actuator 20 is operatively connected to the
vehicle body 12 via a first end 22, and to the tailgate via a second end 24.  Similarly, the second actuator 26 is operatively connected to the vehicle body 12 via a first end 28, and to the tailgate via a second end 30.  As shown, the first and second
actuators 20, 26 are each configured as a spindle drive that utilizes a lead screw to translate radial motion into linear motion.  Accordingly, the first actuator 20 and the second actuator 26 are each configured to selectively open and close the
tailgate 18.  In place of the described spindle drive, other devices that are capable of translating radial motion into linear motion, such as a rack and pinion, may also be employed for the first and second actuators 20, 26.
 The system 10 additionally includes a flexible drive system 32 configured to operate substantially simultaneously the first and second actuators 20, 26.  The flexible drive system 32 includes a first flexible drive element 34 configured to
operate the first actuator 20 and a second flexible drive element 36 configured to operate the second actuator 26.  The first flexible drive element 34 is operatively connected to the first end 22 of the first actuator 20, while the second flexible drive
element 36 is operatively connected to the first end 28 of the second actuator 26.  Accordingly, the first and second flexible drive elements 34, 36 are configured to transmit actuating torque to the first and second actuators 20, 26, respectively.
 The flexible drive elements 34, 36 may be produced from any suitable material, such as a flat-wrap cable conduit that is capable of withstanding torsional loads that the flexible drive elements are likely to see during operation of system 10. 
Although, as shown, the flexible drive system 32 operatively connects to the first and second actuators 20, 26 at their respective first ends 22 and 28, nothing precludes the flexible drive system from operating the first and second actuators by
connecting to their respective second ends 24 and 30.  In such a case, the internal mechanism of the first and second actuators 20, 26 would be reversed, such that the second ends 24, 30 could be driven by the flexible drive system 32.
 The tailgate 18 includes a window 38, which may be seen in both FIGS. 1 and 2, wherein FIG. 1 shows the tailgate in an open state and FIG. 2 shows the tailgate in a closed state.  The window 38 is operatively connected to the tailgate 18 and has
an interior surface 40, which may be seen in FIG. 1, and an exterior surface 42, which may be seen in FIG. 2.  The interior surface 40 of the window 38 forms a part of the vehicle's interior, while the exterior surface 40 of the window forms a part of
the exterior of the tailgate 18.  The window 38 may be fixed with respect to the tailgate 18, be configured to pivot with respect to the tailgate 18, or be selectively raised and lowered.
 A window wiper 44 is operatively connected to the tailgate 18 and is configured to wipe or sweep at least a portion of the exterior surface 40.  A motor 46 is mounted on the tailgate 18, and is configured to selectively operate the window wiper
44 and the first and second actuators 20, 26 via the flexible drive system 32.  The motor 46 is electrically connected to and receives power from an energy source 47, such as a battery or a generator.  The motor 46 may be configured to primarily operate
the window wiper 44 and, on demand, be coupled to operate the first and second actuators 20, 26.  Alternatively, the motor 46 may be configured to operate the window wiper 44 and the first and second actuators 20, 26 selectively, without having a primary
torque transmitting path.  Accordingly, the first and second flexible drive elements 34, 36 are configured to transmit torque from the motor 46 to the first and second actuators 20, 26, respectively, to selectively open and close the tailgate 18.  The
motor 46 is coupled to the window wiper 44 and to the first and second actuators 20, 26 via a clutch, which will be described in greater detail below, thus permitting the single motor 46 to operate the window wiper, as well as the first and second
actuators.
 As shown in FIG. 1, the tailgate 18 is hinged to the rear portion 14 of the vehicle body 12 via hinges 48, 50 for substantially vertical pivotable movement and is configured as a liftgate.  The hinges 48, 50 are positioned proximately to the
upper corners 52, 54 of the access opening 16.  Consequently, the hinge 48 is located between the motor 46 and the first end 22 of the first actuator 20.  Additionally, the hinge 50 is located between the motor 46 and the first end 28 of the second
actuator 26.  The flexible nature of the drive elements 34, 36 permits the flexible drive elements to be bent or flexed in order to pass around tailgate hinges 48, 50, and around corners 52, 54 that are otherwise arranged in the path between the motor 46
and the first ends 22, 28.  The flexible drive elements 34, 36 may be similarly routed around other structures that would otherwise be positioned in the path of torque transmission between the motor 46 and the first ends 22, 28.  Furthermore, the
flexible nature of the drive elements 34, 36 permits the motor 46 to be mounted on entirely dissimilar plane relative to the first ends 22 and 28.
 A first actuator 20 and a second actuator 26 are employed to selectively open and close the tailgate 18.  Each of the first actuator 20 and the second actuator 26 operatively connects the tailgate 18 to the vehicle body 12.  The first actuator
20 is operatively connected to the vehicle body 12 via a first end 22, and to the tailgate via a second end 24.  Similarly, the second actuator 26 is operatively connected to the vehicle body 12 via a first end 28, and to the tailgate via a second end
30.  As described with respect to FIG. 1, the first and second actuators 20, 26 are each configured to selectively open and close the tailgate 18.
 For the purpose of coupling the motor 46 to the first and second actuators 20, 26, the system 10 additionally includes a clutch 58.  As seen in FIG. 1, the clutch 58 is operatively connected to each of the motor 46, to the window wiper 44 and to
the first and second actuators 20, 26 via the flexible drive system 32.  The clutch 58 is configured to selectively couple the motor 46 to the window wiper 44 in a first mode of operation and to the first and second actuators 20, 26 in a second mode of
operation.  When the motor 46 generates torque in the first mode, such torque is employed to operate the wiper 44 to typically clear any moisture and/or grime from the window 38.  On the other hand, when the motor 46 generates torque in the second mode,
such torque is employed to substantially simultaneously rotate the first flexible drive element 34 to drive the first end 22 of the first actuator 20 and the second flexible drive element 36 to drive the first end 28 of the second actuator 26 to
selectively open and close the tailgate 18.  Hence, the torque to operate each of the window wiper 44 and the tailgate 18 is generated by the same, single motor 46.  As such, the motor 46 is enabled via the clutch 58 to actuate the window wiper 44 and
selectively open and close the tailgate 18.  The operation of clutch 58 may be regulated by a signal that is sent either from outside or from the interior of the vehicle.  An exemplary configuration of clutch 58 is depicted in FIGS. 3-5, where the clutch
is shown as having one actuator 60 for operating each of the window wiper 44 and the tailgate 18.  As shown in FIGS. 3-5, each actuator 60 employs an active material member 61.
 As shown in FIGS. 3-4, the active material member 61 may be configured as a continuous wire of constant cross-section from a shape memory alloy (SMA) that is secured inside a housing 62 of a single actuator 60.  The active material member 61 may
be selectively energized via an electrical current provided by the energy source 47 through a switch 63.  As shown in FIG. 3, when active material member 61 is in its original shape, a shaft 64 operatively connected to a coupling device such as a dog
clutch 65 is in a starting position and the dog clutch is disengaged.  Active material member 61 is configured to undergo a shape change and thus translate a shaft 64 to engage dog clutch 65 when the active material member is subjected to the electrical
current, as shown in FIG. 4.  Active material member 61 regains its original shape when the current is taken away, and a biasing spring 69 pulls shaft 64 back to the starting position and disengages dog clutch 65.
 As shown in FIG. 5, two separate actuators 60 may be combined to form clutch 58, be operatively connected to the motor 46, and be used to separately drive the first and second actuators 20, 26.  As shown, each of the two such actuators 60 is
selectively energized via energy source 47 through a separate switch 63 whose closure is regulated by a signal to the motor 46 from an appropriate controller or other actuating device.  Additionally, each of the two such actuators 60 is connected to the
motor 46 via a separate idler gear 66, wherein the separate idler gears 66 may have identical tooth counts and diameters or be dissimilar in that regard.
 The motor 46 is operatively connected to a gear 68.  Accordingly, each idler gear 66 is driven by the motor 46 via the gear 68.  Thus, when the active material member 61 of one of the two actuators 60 is energized, that particular active
material member engages one dog clutch 65 to operate the window wiper 44.  Similarly, when active material member 61 of the other of the two actuators 60 is energized, that active material member engages the other dog clutch 65 to selectively open and
close the tailgate 18.  Although the clutch 58 is depicted as having multiple actuators 60 with active material members 61, any appropriate mechanism for operating the window wiper 44 and/or the tailgate 18 by the motor 46, such as a single or a
plurality of electromechanical solenoids, may be used.
 FIG. 6 illustrates an actuating system 70 that includes a tailgate 72.  The actuating system 70 operates identically to the system 10 described with respect to FIGS. 1-2, except that the tailgate 72 is configured as a swing-out door.  The
tailgate 72 is hinged to the rear portion 14 of the vehicle body via hinges 74, 76 for substantially horizontal pivotable movement relative to the vehicle body 12.  The first actuator 20 and the second actuator 26 are employed to selectively open and
close the tailgate 72.  The first actuator 20 and the second actuator 26 operatively connect the tailgate 72 to the vehicle body 12.  The first actuator 20 is operatively connected to the vehicle body 12 via the first end 22, and to the tailgate via the
second end 24.  Similarly, the second actuator 26 is operatively connected to the vehicle body 12 via the first end 28, and to the tailgate 72 via the second end 30.  As described with respect to FIG. 1, the first and second actuators 20, 26 are each
configured to selectively open and close the tailgate 18.
 Similar to the tailgate 18, the tailgate 72 includes the window 38.  The window 38 is operatively connected to the tailgate 72.  The window wiper 44 is operatively connected to the tailgate 72 and is configured to wipe or sweep at least a
portion of the exterior surface 42 of the window 38.  The motor 46 is mounted on the tailgate 72, and, identically to its operation with respect to the system 10, is configured to selectively operate the window wiper 44 and the tailgate 72.  Although in
each of the systems 10 and 70, the motor 46 and the clutch 58 are shown as positioned on the tailgate 18, nothing precludes the motor and the clutch from being positioned on the rear portion 14 of the vehicle body proximate to the access opening 16. 
Such alternate positioning of the motor 46 and the clutch 58 would nonetheless retain all the operative connections and functionality described above.
 In each of the systems 10 and 70, the clutch 58 may be regulated to couple the motor 46 to the window wiper 44 in the first mode of operation via a first control device 78 operatively connected to the tailgate 18, such as a button positioned in
the interior of the vehicle (as shown in FIGS. 1 and 6).  The clutch 58 may also be regulated to couple the motor 46 to the first and second actuators 20, 26 in the second mode of operation via a second control device.  The contemplated second control
device may be a lever 80 located on the tailgate, as shown in FIGS. 1, 2, and 6.  Also, the second control device may be at least one of a button 82 positioned in the interior of the vehicle and a remote controller 84, such as a hand-held transmitter for
generating an actuating signal, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 6.
 While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the
scope of the appended claims.

",,"RELATED APPLICATIONS
 The present application is a national phase of PCT/US2010/060271, filed Dec.  14, 2010 and is based on, and claims priority from, German Application Number 10 2009 060 119.8, filed Dec.  15, 2009.
 The invention relates to an actuation device for opening and closing a cover in or on an automobile, with a push-push kinematic which engages with the cover.  Actuation devices of this type are used to open and close fuel flaps of automobiles
and are known, for instance, from DE 196 50 594 A1.  DE 10 2007 011 541 A1 discloses an actuation device in which a control device is disposed beside a locking pin and is kinematically connected to the locking pin.  In this way, the overall height is
intended to be reduced.  However, a complex construction involving a large number of components is disadvantageous.  The known device is hence not always sufficiently robust in practice.  DE 101 48 199 A1 discloses an actuation device in which a locking
pin is supported rotatably about its longitudinal axis in the manner of a bayonet fastening.  However, this device too possesses a comparatively complex and non-robust construction.  Moreover, there is a need also to provide covers of comparatively small
body openings with actuation devices with a push-push kinematic, as are used, for example, in electric vehicles for access to an electrical charging device.
 Starting from the illustrative prior art, the object of the invention is to provide an actuation device of the type stated in the introduction, with which actuation device also covers for small body openings, in particular, can be actuated in a
constructively simpler and thus more robust and cost-effective manner.
 The invention achieves this object by virtue of the subject of claim 1.
 Advantageous embodiments are found in the dependent claims, the description and the figures.
 The invention achieves the object by virtue of an actuation device for opening and closing a cover in or on an automobile, with a push-push kinematic which engages with the cover, wherein the push-push kinematic comprises the following features:
a housing, which is suitable for installation in an automobile, a pusher supported in the housing such that it is rotatable about its longitudinal axis and axially movable, which pusher comprises an outer actuation end, which during an actuation
protrudes via a housing opening out of the housing at least temporarily and engages with the cover, and an inner actuation end being opposite the outer actuation end, a spring in the housing, which biases the pusher out of the housing, a ring surrounding
the pusher over a part of its axial range of movement, which ring is supported in an axially fixed and rotatable manner in the housing and which comprises at least one projection on its inner circumference, at least one groove extending on the outside of
the pusher at least in sections helically about the longitudinal axis of the pusher, and at least one projection on the inner circumference of the housing, which engages with the groove at least over a wide axial range of movement of the pusher, so that
the pusher upon an axial movement in the housing is also rotated about its longitudinal axis, a first diverting surface on the pusher between the groove and the inner actuation end and extending obliquely with regard to the axis of the pusher, which
diverting surface engages with the at least one projection of the ring and rotates the ring by a predetermined angular amount when the pusher is moved into the housing by a predetermined first stroke, at least one locking recess on the pusher at a
circumferential distance to the at least one first diverting surface and being open toward the outer actuation end, which locking recess receives the at least one projection of the ring when the pusher is released after the first stroke, whereby the
pusher is locked in a locking position after a reverse stroke in the housing, and at least one second diverting surface between the locking recess and the groove, which extends obliquely with regard to the axis of the pusher, and which second diverting
surface engages with the at least one projection of the ring when the pusher is moved out of the locking position by a second stroke further into the housing, whereby the ring is rotated by a predetermined second angular amount into a rotational position
in which the pusher is movable out of the ring into its furthest extended position, wherein the at least one projection of the ring exits through an exit opening at the inner actuation end of the pusher.
 According to the invention, a push-push kinematic is combined in a constructively simple manner with a simultaneous rotational movement of the pusher.  The pusher can thus be locked or unlocked in the housing in a manner which is known per se
for push-push devices.  In this case, however, the pusher, in the course of its axial movement, simultaneously performs a rotational movement.  This is realized by the at least one helical groove of the pusher and by the engagement of the at least one
projection on the inner circumference of the housing into the groove.  The first and second diverting surface, together with the locking recess, here form the actual control cam for the push-push locking and unlocking mechanism.  This can be in the form,
in particular, of a heart-shaped cam.  The embodiment and function of this control cam corresponds to the embodiment in the parallel, as yet unpublished German patent application of the Applicant with the official file reference 10 2008 057 933.  In
contrast to the design which is described there, in the present invention, however, a rotational movement of the pusher is on the one hand effected.  On the other hand, the pusher, when it extends into its furthest extended position, moves out of the
ring which is held in an axially fixed and rotatable manner in the housing.  The ring surrounds the pusher, therefore, only over a part of its axial motional path.  As soon as the pusher has left the ring, and hence also the at least one ring projection
is no longer in engagement with the control cam of the pusher, the pusher is guided only by the cooperation of the at least one projection on the housing inner circumference and the at least one groove on the pusher.
 The actuation device according to the invention is distinguished by a small number of components and hence a robust and cost-effective construction.  At the same time, the actuation device is particularly compact, so that it can be fitted from
outside into the vehicle opening to be closed off by the cover or removed for servicing.  Fitting and servicing is thereby simplified considerably in relation to the prior art, in which, due to the considerable total size, a fitting from the inner side
of the vehicle can be necessary.  At the same time, the device is also suitable for small covers and vehicle openings.  Since exclusively plastics parts can be used for the actuation device, moreover, the endurance limit is able to be improved and the
component tolerance made narrower.  All parts of the device can be manufactured by injection molding.  By contrast, the spring can be a helical spring made of a metal material.
 The at least one projection on the inner circumference of the housing can be engaged with the at least one groove over the entire axial motional path of the pusher.  The outer actuation end can protrude from the pusher via the housing opening
likewise over the entire axial motional path thereof.  The first and second diverting surfaces, as well as the locking recess of the control cam, can be formed on radial elevations of the pusher.  The at least one locking recess can possess a V-shape or
U-shape, for instance, in cross section.  The at least one groove of the pusher can be configured between adjacent elevations of the pusher.  In a manner which is known per se, a hood made of flexible material, for instance plastic or rubber, which hood
covers the pusher outside of the housing and is axially collapsible, can be fitted on the outside of the housing.  It can further be provided that the at least one groove, in the fully extended position of the pusher, remains in the housing.  An unwanted
ingress of water or impurities through the groove is thereby reliably avoided.  In order to improve the motional guidance of the pusher, the pusher can comprise five circumferentially equally spaced grooves, first and second diverting surfaces and
locking recesses.  The housing and the ring can on their inner circumference then likewise each comprise five equally spaced projections.  Of course, other numbers for the grooves, first and second diverting surfaces, locking recesses and ring
projections are also possible.
 According to a further embodiment, the at least one groove, at its end facing toward the outer actuation end of the pusher, can comprise a section extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the pusher, which section is at least as long as
the reverse stroke of the pusher in the housing into its locking position, wherein the at least one projection of the housing is guided in the axis-parallel section of the groove during the reverse stroke.  The axial section can, in particular, be at
least as long as the distance between the inner actuation end of the pusher and that point of the second diverting surface which is furthest distanced from the inner actuation end.  The at least one housing projection is thus aligned to the pusher in the
axial direction such that the housing projection is guided straight in the axial section of the groove when the at least one projection of the ring is located within the control cam for the push-push kinematic.  With this embodiment, the pusher is
guaranteed not to be twisted while the ring passes through the control cam.
 On its side facing away from the housing opening, the housing can comprise a cover section.  The ring can then be received in an inner ring recess on the cover section.  Such a cover section can be formed, for instance, integrally with the
housing.  It can also however be in the form of a separate part, which is positively connected, for instance, to the housing.  Of course, the cover could also, for instance, be latched, bonded or welded to the housing.  The ring can be held between the
housing and the cover part.  The spring which moves the pusher into its furthest extended position in the event of an unlocking can be supported, on the one hand, on an inner side of the cover section and, on the other hand, on a contact surface of the
pusher.  The contact surface of the pusher can be constituted, for instance, by its inner actuation end.  Furthermore, a pin guided through the cover section can be provided on the pusher, with which pin a control device is controllable.  The pin can be
connected integrally, for instance, to the pusher.  The control device can send control signals to onboard electronics of an automobile provided with the actuation device.  For instance, in the closed position of the cover and hence the retracted
position of the pusher, the pin can close a contact which opens in accordance with an extension of the pusher and hence an opening of the cover.  In this way, a check is possible to establish whether the cover is properly closed.  It is also conceivable,
via such a pin, to effect a locking of the pusher within a central locking system of an automobile.  To this end, the pin can engage a corresponding solenoid actuator, for instance.
 According to a further embodiment, the pusher can comprise a lateral opening, which in the locking position of the pusher aligns with a corresponding lateral opening of the housing, wherein a closing pin is guidable from the outside through the
lateral opening of the housing into the lateral opening of the pusher, so that the pusher cannot be moved out of its locking position.  Such a closing pin can be part of a central locking system of an automobile provided with the device.  If the vehicle
is locked, the closing pin guided through the corresponding openings of the housing and of the pusher also locks the cover, by blocking a movement of the pusher in the housing.  If the vehicle, on the other hand, is opened, the closing pin can be
withdrawn at least from the opening of the pusher, so that the pusher is movable in the axial direction in the housing.
 According to a further embodiment, it can be provided that the housing comprises at least in sections a hollow cylindrical basic form, and that the pusher comprises at least in sections a cylindrical basic form, wherein the housing on its outer
circumference comprises at least one locking projection and at least one locking recess arranged offset with regard to the locking projection in the axial and/or circumferential direction.  With this embodiment, the actuation device can be fitted in a
body opening in a particularly simple manner.  To this end, at least one guide element, in particular at least one guide groove, provided in the lead-in direction of the actuation device, can be provided on the body opening, wherein the at least one
locking projection of the actuation device and the at least one guide groove of the component, when the actuation device is introduced into the opening, engage in such a way that the actuation device, in at least one predetermined rotational position, is
insertable into the opening.  Furthermore, emanating from the body opening in the lead-in direction of the actuation device, a locking projection can be provided, wherein the locking projection of the body opening and the locking recess of the actuation
device interlock when the actuation device in the predetermined rotational position is fully inserted in the body opening, so that the actuation device is locked in place in the body opening.  By rotation of the actuation device out of the predetermined
rotational position, the locking mechanism can then be released again, whereupon the body opening resiliently yields for a brief moment.  The fitting and removal of the actuation device is simplified considerably by this embodiment.  In particular, a
non-destructive removal is also possible.  This embodiment substantially corresponds to the embodiment in the parallel, as yet unpublished German patent application of the Applicant with the official file reference 10 2009 008 496.
 As protection against the ingress of dust, liquid, such as water, or other impurities, on the housing opening and/or between the rim of the cover and the rim of the opening of an automobile which is to be optionally opened or closed by the
cover, a surrounding seal can be provided.  Such a seal can be, for instance, a plastics seal.
 The at least one groove can further comprise on its end facing away from the outer actuation end of the pusher a locking receptacle, which is open toward the outer actuation end of the pusher and in which the at least one projection of the
housing is received in the furthest extended position of the pusher.  This locking receptacle ensures that the housing projection, when the pusher is fully extended, cannot lose its engagement with the groove of the pusher.  At the same time, the maximum
extension position of the pusher is defined by the locking receptacle.  The locking receptacle can possess a V-shape or U-shape, for instance, in cross section.  It can further be provided that opposite the exit opening of the inner actuation end of the
pusher and at a circumferential distance to the second diverting surface at least a first mounting diverting surface is provided, extending obliquely with regard to the axis of the pusher, and that further at a circumferential distance to the first
mounting diverting surface a second mounting diverting surface is provided, extending obliquely with regard to the axis of the pusher in the opposite direction and leading into the locking receptacle, so that upon mounting of the pusher in the housing
the at least one projection of the housing is guided through the exit opening of the inner actuation end to the first mounting diverting surface, wherein a defined relative rotation between the housing and the pusher in a first rotational direction
occurs, and the at least one projection of the housing is guided to the second mounting diverting surface, wherein a defined relative rotation between the housing and the pusher in a second, opposite rotational direction occurs, and the at least one
projection of the housing is received in the locking receptacle.  The mounting diverting surfaces thus guide the housing projection from the inner actuation end into the locking receptacle, the housing projection being received in the locking receptacle
forming the start of the groove.  A simple initial fitting (and removal) of the pusher in the housing is thereby enabled, at the same time as which it is ensured that the pusher, during subsequent operation of the device, cannot accidentally come loose
from the housing.  The first mounting diverting surface can be formed in a particularly simple manner by the first diverting surface of the control cam.
 According to a further embodiment, the actuation device according to the invention can comprise a cover being pivotable about a pivot axis running perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the pusher, wherein the pusher in the area of its
outer actuation end comprises a locking section, which locking section is engageable with a corresponding locking section of the cover, wherein the locking section of the pusher upon a rotational movement of the pusher is rotated relative to the locking
section of the cover, so that in the locking position of the pusher the locking section of the cover cannot be released from the locking section of the pusher, and in the furthest extended position of the pusher the locking section of the cover can be
released from the locking section of the pusher.  The cover is pivotable about the pivot axis between an open and a closed position by means of a suitable hinge arm, for instance.  The locking sections can be mutually engaged over the entire axial
motional path of the pusher.  The locking section of the pusher is here rotatable in relation to the locking section of the cover.  A suitable configuration of the locking sections enables these to lock the cover against opening by virtue of their
relative rotational position adopted in the locking position of the pusher.  If the pusher is then unlocked inward from its locking position by an overpressure and is moved into its farthest extended position by the spring, the locking section of the
pusher rotates in relation to the locking section of the cover, wherein in the furthest extended position the locking sections adopt such a rotational position with regard to each other that the cover can be released from the pusher and can be fully
swung open by hand, whereupon the locking sections separate.  Upon closure of the cover, the locking sections then reengage.  In this embodiment, the rotational movement of the pusher is not therefore transmitted to the cover.  The rotational movement is
instead used only to lock and unlock the locking sections.  The locking sections can here be formed by a locking projection, for example a locking hammer, on the one hand and a suitable locking receptacle on the other hand.  For instance, the locking
projection can be formed on the pusher and the locking receptacle on the cover.  A reverse arrangement is also possible, however.
 According to an alternative embodiment, the actuation device can comprise a cover being pivotable about the longitudinal axis of the pusher, which cover is fixedly connected to the outer actuation end of the pusher.  In this embodiment, the
cover is therefore pivotable, in particular, about the longitudinal axis of the pusher.  As a result of the fixed connection between pusher and cover, the cover, upon the axial and rotational movement of the pusher, is thus likewise moved axially and
rotationally.  The rotational movement of the pusher is transmitted to the cover.  The pusher and the cover can be connected to each other integrally or otherwise.  In this embodiment, advantageously, no hinge arm is therefore necessary.  The
installation space of the device is thereby reduced further, so that use even in connection with particularly small covers and hence body openings is possible, such as, for instance, in connection with charging openings of electric vehicles.  Even in
such small openings, a fitting and removal of the device is thus possible from outside.
 The angular amount of the rotation of the pusher between its locking position and its fully extended position can be predetermined by a suitable embodiment of the at least one groove of the pusher.  For instance, the angular amount can be at
least 90.degree.  and maximally 180.degree..  If the rotation of the pusher is used only for the locking by the locking sections, without transmission of the rotational movement of the pusher to the cover, an angular amount of 90.degree., for instance,
can suffice.  If, on the other hand, the rotation of the pusher is transmitted directly to the cover in order to turn this laterally away from the opening to be closed off, a larger angular amount is desirable in order to clear the opening sufficiently. 
By way of example, an angular amount ranging from 135.degree.  to 180.degree.  can be cited.
 The cover can be constituted, for instance, by a fuel flap for a fuel tank opening or a cover for an electrical charging opening of an automobile.  For the comparatively large fuel flaps for access to a fuel tank, a flap pivotable about a pivot
axis running perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the pusher is particularly suitable.  For the comparatively small covers for charging openings of electric vehicles, which can have a diameter of less than 150 mm, in particular less than 120 mm,
the fixed connection of pusher and cover is particularly suitable, wherein the cover is moved axially and rotationally as one with the pusher.  In the charging opening, electrical connections, in particular plugs or sockets, can be arranged.  Into the
vehicle opening provided with the device can be integrated a charging current indicator, for example a light-emitting diode display.  For instance, it is conceivable to provide a lighting device in a marginal boundary of the opening to be closed off by
the cover.  It is also possible for the cover to be constituted by an emblem or logo of an automobile manufacturer.  This is conceivable, in particular, in respect of covers for electrical charging openings.  An illustrative embodiment of the
invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to figures, wherein, in schematic representation:

 FIGS. 13, 14 show a device according to FIG. 10 in a sectional view in two operating positions according to a further illustrative embodiment.
 Unless otherwise stated, in the figures the same reference symbols denote the same items.  In FIGS. 1a to 1c, an actuation device according to the invention is represented in three operating states.  The device comprises a housing 10 which is
hollow cylindrical in its basic form, which housing can be inserted into a suitable opening of an automobile.  On its top side, the housing 10 possesses a housing opening 12, which is provided with a surrounding plastics seal 14.  That side of the
housing 10 which lies opposite the opening 12 is closed off by a cover part 16, which is inserted positively into the housing 10.  In the housing 10, a substantially cylindrical pusher 18 is arranged such that it is supported in an axially movable and
rotatable manner.  The pusher 18 possesses an outer actuation end 22 provided with a locking section 20, and an inner actuation end 24 lying opposite the outer actuation end 22.  Extending downward from the inner actuation end 24 in the figures is a pin
26 integrally molded to the pusher 18.  Supported between the inner side of the cover part 16 and a suitable contact surface of the pusher 18 is a cylindrical helical spring 28.  This biases the pusher 18 into its position extended from the housing 10. 
In the represented example, the pusher 18 further comprises five grooves 30, which extend at equal circumferential distance apart at least in sections helically about the longitudinal axis of the pusher 18.  The grooves 30 each possess at their lower end
in the figures a locking receptacle 32, which is open toward the outer actuation end 24 and possesses a U-shape in cross section.  At their opposite upper end, the grooves 30 possess a section 34 extending in the axial direction in the pusher.  Located
on the inner circumference of the housing 10 are five projections 36, which are likewise at an equal circumferential distance apart and correspond to the grooves 30 and which can be seen, for instance, in FIG. 8.  In the shown example, the projections 36
are engaged with the grooves 30 over the entire axial range of movement of the pusher 18.  In addition, a control ring 38 is supported in an axially fixed and rotatable manner in a ring recess between the housing 10 and the cover part 16.  The ring 38
possesses on its inner circumference likewise five projections 40 arranged at an axial circumferential distance apart.
 In FIGS. 2a to 2c, for instance, in which, for reasons of clarity, the housing 10 and the cover part 16 are not shown, it can be seen that the locking section 20 of the pusher 18 comprises an elongated opening 42.  In FIGS. 1 and 2, a locking
section 44 of a cover (not represented in detail) to be actuated by the actuation device, in the represented example a fuel flap of an automobile, is also shown.  It can be seen that the locking section 44, at its end facing toward the locking section 20
of the pusher 18, comprises a locking hammer 46, the shape of which is such that the hammer 46 in precisely one rotational position of the pusher 18, namely the rotational position shown in FIGS. 1a and 2a, can be received in the locking section 20 of
the pusher 18.  If the pusher 18 on the other hand, in the course of its axial movement in the housing 10, is rotated through 90.degree.  toward the locking hammer 46 in relation to the position in FIGS. 1a and 2a, as shown in FIGS. 1b and 1c and 2b and
2c, the locking hammer 46 is trapped in the locking section 20.  In this state, the cover, upon an axial movement of the pusher 18, is pivoted about a pivot axis running perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the pusher 18.  It should also be noted
that in FIGS. 1a and 2a the device is respectively shown in an open position, wherein the pusher 18 is in its furthest extended position.  In FIGS. 1b and 2b on the other hand, the pusher 18, and with it the device, is in a locking position, in which a
removal of the locking section 44 from the locking section 20, and hence an opening of the cover, is not possible.  In FIGS. 1c and 2c, the pusher 18 on the other hand has been brought by further pressing into the housing 10 into its unlocking position,
from which upon subsequent release, actuated by the spring 28, it is movable into the furthest extended position shown in FIGS. 1a and 2a.  In this position, the locking section 44 can be removed from the device and hence the cover connected thereto can
be swung open.
 For the locking and unlocking of the pusher 18, a control cam with push-push kinematic is used, which control cam runs between the lower end of the grooves 30 and the inner actuation end 24 of the pusher 18.  It shall be explained in greater
detail with reference to the representation in FIG. 9.  As already mentioned, the grooves 30 end at their lower end in a locking receptacle 32 of roughly U-shaped cross section.  It can additionally be seen that the control cam for the push-push
kinematic respectively comprises first diverting surfaces 48 extending obliquely with regard to the longitudinal axis of the pusher 18.  These are formed by the bottom side of the locking receptacle 32.  Insofar as the pusher 18 is moved out of the
position shown in FIG. 9, corresponding to the position in FIGS. 1a and 2a, down into the ring 38, the ring projections 40 make their way through exit openings 50 at the inner actuation end 24 of the pusher 18 into the control cam and into contact with
the first diverting surfaces 48.  The inner projections 36 of the housing 10 are here guided in the axis-parallel sections 34 of the grooves 30.  The pusher 18 is thus not rotatable about its longitudinal axis as long as the projections 40 of the ring 38
are passing through the control cam.  As a result of the oblique diverting surfaces 48, the ring 38 is rotated by a defined angular amount, to the right in the figures.  If the pusher 18 is then released, the force of the spring 28 gives rise to a
reverse stroke of the pusher 18.  The projections 40 of the ring 38 make their way into V-shaped locking recesses 52, which are arranged at a circumferential distance to the first diverting surfaces and are open toward the outer actuation end of the
pusher 18.  In these, the projections 40 are received, so that the pusher 18 is in its locking position and cannot be extended out of the housing 10.  This operating position is shown in FIGS. 1b and 2b.  If the pusher 18 is pressed out of its operating
position further into the housing 10, as shown in FIGS. 1c and 2c, the projections 40 of the ring 38 are guided out of the locking recesses 52 and enter into contact with second diverting surfaces 54 arranged also at a circumferential distance to the
locking recesses 52 and aligned likewise obliquely with regard to the longitudinal axis of the pusher 18.  The ring is hereupon rotated once again by a defined angular amount, to the right in the figures.  If the pusher 18 is then released, the
projections 40 of the ring 38, upon the movement of the pusher 18 out of the housing, which movement is effected by the spring 28, make their way out of the pusher 18 through the respectively next exit opening 50 (in terms of circumferential distance) of
the inner actuation end 24, so that the pusher can be moved into its furthest extended position.  The pusher 18 hereupon distances itself from the ring 38, as shown in FIGS. 1a and 2a.  This function of the push-push kinematic corresponds in principle to
the function evident from the parallel German patent application 10 2008 057 933 of the Applicant.
 In FIG. 9 it can further be seen that the first diverting surfaces 48 respectively simultaneously form a first mounting diverting surface for the initial fitting of the pusher 18 in the housing 10.  Also at a circumferential distance to the
first diverting surface 48, there is respectively located above the locking receptacle 32 a second mounting diverting surface 56, which runs in the direction opposite to the mounting diverting surface 48 obliquely with regard to the longitudinal axis of
the pusher 18.  In the initial fitting of the pusher 18 in the housing 10, the housing projections 36 are guided correspondingly through the exit openings 50 to the first diverting surface 48, from which, under a relative rotation of the pusher 18 with
respect to the housing 10, they make their way onward to the second diverting surface 56, from which in turn, under an opposite-running relative rotation between pusher 18 and housing 10, they make their way into the locking receptacle 32.  This
simplifies the initial fitting (and, where necessary, removal) of the pusher 18 in the housing 10.
 In FIGS. 3a and 3b, it can further be seen that in the represented example the housing 10 comprises on its outer circumference two locking projections 58, which lie opposite one another.  These projections 58 can also be seen in FIG. 8.  Offset
in the axial and circumferential directions with respect to the projections 58, two likewise mutually opposing locking recesses 60 are respectively located on the outside of the housing.  With these locking projections 58 and locking recesses 60, a
particularly simple fitting and removal of the device in a correspondingly shaped body opening is possible, as is described in the parallel, as yet unpublished German patent application with file reference 10 2009 008 496 of the Applicant.  In FIGS. 4
and 5 it can be seen that, on the top side of the pusher 18 and on the base of the opening 42, a buffer stop 43 for the locking hammer 46 is provided.
 With reference to FIGS. 10 to 14, a further illustrative embodiment of an actuation device according to the invention shall be described.  The function of the pusher 18, and in particular its interaction with the housing 10 and the ring 38, is
identical to the device from FIGS. 1 to 9.  While in the illustrative embodiment according to FIGS. 1 to 9, however, the rotational movement of the pusher 18 and of its locking section 20 is not transmitted to the fuel flap, but is instead used to lock
and unlock the locking sections 20, 44, in the illustrative embodiment according to FIGS. 10 to 14 a cover 62 for a body opening of an automobile is fixedly connected to the outer actuation end 22 of the pusher 18.  In contrast to the illustrative
embodiment according to FIGS. 1 to 9, in which the fuel flap can be opened and closed, for instance, via a pivot axis running perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the pusher 18 and a suitable hinge arm, the cover 62 according to FIGS. 10 to 14 is
moved upon a movement of the pusher 18 in the axial direction of the pusher and is simultaneously pivoted about the longitudinal axis of the pusher 18.  This pivot axis is illustrated in FIG. 10 with the reference symbol 64.  The cover 62 can be
constituted by a cover for an access opening 66 in an electric vehicle for the electrical charging of a vehicle battery.  To this end, an electric plug 68 can be disposed in the opening 66, as shown, for instance, in FIG. 10.  The plug 68 is located in a
corresponding recess 70.  In the sectional representation in FIGS. 13 and 14, this recess 70 is not shown.  The opening 66 is delimited by a surrounding elevation 72.  On its inside there is a surrounding dust-protection seal 74 made of plastic.  In the
state of the cover 62 which is shown in FIGS. 12 and 14, the dust protection seal 74 seals the opening against the ingress of dust, water or other impurities.
 Just like the device from FIGS. 1 to 9, the device according to FIGS. 10 to 14 can be unlocked by pressing of the cover 62 and, with it, of the pusher 18, inward out of the locked position shown in FIGS. 12 and 14, so that, upon subsequent
release of the cover 62, this, driven by the spring 28, is transported jointly with the pusher 18 upward out of the housing 10, at the same time as the pusher 18 rotates the cover 62 about its longitudinal axis and thus pivots it away from the opening
66.  This is shown in FIGS. 10, 11 and 13.  If, in this position, a force is again exerted inward upon the rotational axis 64, the pusher 18, and with it the cover 62, is moved back inward and rotated into the locking position shown in FIGS. 12 and 14. 
In the example shown in FIGS. 10 to 14, the pusher 18, and with it the cover 62, performs a rotation through about 135.degree.  between the closed state shown in FIGS. 12 and 14 and the open state of the cover 62 shown in FIGS. 10, 11 and 13.  It is also
conceivable, however, that the cover 62 and the pusher 18 perform a greater rotation, for instance 180.degree., in order to clear the opening 66 still further.  In the illustrative embodiment according to FIGS. 1 to 9, on the other hand, a rotation of
the pusher 18 of about 90.degree.  can be sufficient.
 In the illustrative embodiment according to FIGS. 11 and 12, moreover, the pin 26 of the pusher 18 engages a control device 76.  For instance, the pin 26, in the locked position shown in FIG. 12, can close a contact 78 of the control device 76. 
The control device 76 can report this closing of the contact 78, and hence the existence of the properly closed position of the cover 62, to on-board electronics of the vehicle.  It is also conceivable, however, to configure the contact 78 as a solenoid
actuator, so that, by the induction of a magnetic field, the pin 26, and with it the pusher 18, can be held in the locked position shown in FIG. 12.  The triggering of the magnetic field can be realized in coordination with a central locking system of
the vehicle, so that the cover 62 cannot be opened when the vehicle is locked.
 In the illustrative embodiment shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, the housing 10 can possess a lateral opening 80.  The pusher can likewise possess a lateral opening 82, which in the locking position of the pusher 18 shown in FIG. 14 aligns with the
opening 80 of the housing 10.  In this position, a closing pin 84 of a central locking device 86 can move into the openings 80, 82 and thus block the pusher 18, and with it the cover 62, in the locking position against opening, for instance when the
vehicle is locked.  If the vehicle is opened on the other hand, the central locking device 86 can withdraw the closing pin 84 from the openings 80, 82, as shown in FIG. 13.  The pusher 18 can then extend upward.
 Those functions of the pin 26 which are described with respect to FIGS. 10 to 14, inclusive of the control device 76 and the contact 78, and the central locking device 86 with closing pin 84 and openings 80, 82, can of course also be provided in
the illustrative embodiment according to FIGS. 1 to 9.

associated, optional, drain system.
BACKGROUND
 This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.
 Tonneau covers have been used for a number of years to cover the cargo box of pickup trucks against dirt, debris, and other environmental contaminants and to improve the aesthetic quality thereof.  Originally, tonneau covers were designed by
upholstery shops and typically made of vinyl covered fabrics or canvas.  The material was often doubled over along its edges for added strength and appearance.  Male snaps were then attached to the sides of the cargo box of the pickup truck via
fasteners, while female snaps were attached along the edges of the cover.  Wooden bows were sometimes used to span the cargo box and ensure that the cover remained high enough to drain water.  Unfortunately, these covers were sometimes difficult to
handle and/or manufacture, and occasionally failed to protect the cargo box.
 More recently, foldable tonneau covers are often more desirable in that they conveniently cover the bed of the pickup truck for cargo protection.  However, when not in use, the foldable tonneau cover may be folded toward the rear of the
passenger cabin (or other location).  Generally, foldable tonneau covers include a frame network of cross bows, a tarp or covering operably coupled to and spanning the frame network, a latching system for coupling the frame network to the pickup truck
and a means for stowing the latching system, and a hinge system for hingedly coupled adjacent sections of the foldable tonneau cover.  However, the known prior art fails to maximize the ease and effectiveness of foldable tonneau covers and, thus, many
foldable tonneau covers suffer from numerous disadvantages.
 When conventional foldable tonneau covers are stowed, that is when the tonneau cover is folded and positioned generally adjacent the passenger cabin, it is important to ensure that any clamps or latching members are easily released to enable
quick and convenient access to the pickup bed area and/or contents.  It is also important that the tonneau cover is properly and securely retained to the cargo box of the pickup truck.  Although various systems have been used to attempt such connections,
many rely on complex and complicated attachment systems.
 In some systems, water leaks and other drainage issues can compromise the tonneau system and/or the contents of the cargo box.  Although seals and other solutions have been used to combat such drainage and/or leakage problems, an inexpensive and
effective solution has not, until now, been found.
 Accordingly, there exists a need in the relevant art to provide a tonneau cover system capable of overcoming the disadvantages of the prior art.  Additionally, there exists a need in the relevant art to provide a tonneau cover system, and in
particular a retention system that securely retains the tonneau cover in a closed positions and permits simple and convenient disengagement of the retention system when opening the tonneau system or otherwise gaining access to the cargo box.  Still
further, there exists a need in the relevant art to provide a tonneau cover system having a drain system to safely drain water and/or prevent other contaminants from entering the cargo box.
SUMMARY
 This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.  According to the principles of the present teachings, a tonneau cover system for a cargo box of a pickup
truck is provided having advantageous construction and methods of operation.  The system comprises a plurality of tonneau sections each being pivotally coupled to the other to permit pivotal movement of a first tonneau sections relative to a second
tonneau sections between an opened position and a closed position.  The tonneau cover system further comprises a side rail member connectable to a side wall of the cargo box, a keeper member downwardly extending from the first tonneau sections for
pivotal movement therewith between the opened position and the closed position; and a first keeper pin coupled with the side rail member.  The keeper member automatically engages the first keeper pin when the first tonneau section is pivoted into the
closed position and automatically disengages the first keeper pin when the first tonneau section is pivoted into the open position.
 Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein.  The description and specific examples in this summary are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the
present disclosure. DRAWINGS

 With reference to FIG. 1, a pickup truck 100 is shown having a foldable tonneau system 12 for use with pickup truck 100.  Pickup truck 100 generally includes a cargo box 102 and a passenger cabin 104.  Cargo box 102 includes a front wall (not
shown), a left sidewall 108, a right sidewall 110, and a rear wall or tailgate 112.  It should be understood that right sidewall 110 and left sidewall 108 of pickup truck 100 are identical, yet arranged in mirrored symmetry.  Accordingly, in the interest
of brevity, only one side will be discussed in detail below in connection with foldable tonneau system 12 unless noted otherwise
 Still referring to FIG. 1, foldable tonneau system 12 includes, in some embodiments, a flexible, stretchable fabric cover 14 (or other suitable cover material being soft or hard) that is drawn tightly over a plurality of tonneau sections 16.  It
should be understood that the principles of the present invention are equally applicable to foldable tonneau systems having two, three, or more sections, each foldable relative to adjacent sections.  However, for purposes of this disclosure, a foldable
tonneau system having three tonneau sections 16a, 16b, and 16n will be described.  This configuration should not be regarded as limiting the claims herein.  Tonneau sections 16a-16n may be referred to herein as front tonneau section 16a, middle tonneau
section 16b, and rear tonneau section 16n.
 Each of the plurality of tonneau sections 16a-16n includes an internal framework of support members that are attached to one another to form a rectangular frame.  Specifically, front tonneau section 16a includes a front rail member 20 fixedly
coupled to a pair of side members 22 via a corner insert 24.  Corner insert 24 is preferably rounded along an exterior surface to prevent stress concentrations in fabric cover 14.  Corner insert 24 includes a pair of male portions (not shown) sized to be
fixedly received and engaged within front rail member 20 and the pair of side members 22.  A corner brace 26 is fixedly coupled, via conventional threaded fasteners, between front rail member 20 and each side member 22 to provide improved structural
integrity.  Front tonneau section 16a further includes one or more cross bow members 28 being generally parallel to front rail member 20 and spaced apart therefrom (in some embodiments, other tonneau sections can also include cross bow members, such as
cross bow members 46 of tonneau section 16b).  In some embodiments, cross bow member 28 is generally C-shaped in cross section and is fixedly coupled to the pair of side members 22 via a corner brace 30 disposed on opposing ends thereof.  It should be
understood that additional or alternative connection features may be employed to couple cross bow member 28 to the pair of side members 22.  Moreover, it should be understood that cross bow members 28, 40, and 46 can be made of any suitable material and
define any suitable cross-sectional size and shape.  The pair of side members 22 is adapted to rest upon a top surface of sidewalls 108 and 110.
 Similarly, rear tonneau section 16n includes a rear rail member 32 fixedly coupled to a pair of side members 34 via a corner insert 36.  Corner insert 36 is preferably rounded along an exterior surface to prevent stress concentrations in fabric
cover 14.  Corner insert 36 includes a pair of male portions (not shown) sized to be fixedly received and engaged within rear rail member 32 and the pair of side members 34.  A corner brace 38 is fixedly coupled, via conventional threaded fasteners,
between rear rail member 32 and each side member 34 to provide improved structural integrity.  Rear tonneau section 16n further includes a cross bow member 40 being generally parallel to rear rail member 32 and spaced apart therefrom.  For manufacturing
simplicity, cross bow member 40 can be identical to cross bow member 28 in cross section and side members 34 can be similar to, but vary in length relative to, side member 22.  However, it should be appreciated that this is not required.
 Cross bow member 40 is fixedly coupled to the pair of side members 34 via a corner brace 42 disposed on opposing ends thereof.  Again, it should be understood that additional or alternative connection features may be employed to couple cross bow
member 40 to the pair of side members 34.  The pair of side members 34 is adapted to rest upon a top surface of sidewalls 108 and 110.
 For additional detail relating to the construction of tonneau sections 16a, 16b, and 16n, and their association interconnection, attention should be directed to commonly-assigned U.S.  Pat.  No. 7,188,888, which is incorporated herein by
reference.
 In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIGS. 1-7, foldable tonneau system 12 can comprise a bracket system 202 for mounting to any one or more of front wall (not shown), left sidewall 108, right sidewall 110, and rear wall or tailgate 112.  In
some embodiments, bracket system 202 can comprise side rails 210 mounted to side walls 108, 110 using a conventional or otherwise clamping system to provide support for foldable tonneau system 12.  In some embodiments, side rails 210 can extend generally
the length of side walls 108, 110 of cargo box 102.  In some embodiments, side rails 210 can be fixedly coupled to side wall 108 via a clamp assembly.  An example of a clamping system can be found in commonly-assigned U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,752,449, which is
incorporated herein by reference.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 6-7, side rails 210 can be mounted to a top and/or inboard surface of side walls 108, 110.  In some embodiments, side rails 210 can comprise a cross-sectional profile that is conducive to mounting to side walls 108, 110
and further provide a drain system for evacuating water and/or other debris or contaminants prior to entry into cargo box 102.  More particularly, side rails 210 can comprise a generally L-shaped portion 212 having a first portion 214 and a second
portion 216 arranged in perpendicular fashion to be mounted on a complementary portion of side walls 108, 110 of cargo box 102.  Specifically, first portion 214 can rest upon an upper surface of side walls 108, 100 to provide Z-axis support (e.g.
vertical support) and second portion 216 can rest upon an inboard surface of side walls 108, 110 to provide Y-axis support (e.g. cross-vehicle support).  Second portion 216 can comprise a series of retention teeth 217 does there along for engagement with
a clamp assembly to facilitate fastening of side rails 210 to side walls 108, 110 of cargo box 102.
 An angular member 218 can be joined to and extend from a junction of first portion 214 and second portion 216, or directly from second portion 216.  Angular member 218, ideally, is inboardly-sloped to direct moisture and/or other liquids into a
drain channel 220 formed at an elevational position generally below first portion 214 to encourage flow therein.  Drain channel 220 can be positioned generally at or between a contact interface of tonneau cover system 12 and cargo box 102.  In some
embodiments, drain channel 220 comprises a vertically-extending outboard portion 222, a bottom portion 224, and a vertically-extending inboard portion 226, together forming a generally U-shaped cross-section.
 In some embodiments, an optional seal member 228 (FIG. 6) can be disposed at a distal end of vertically-extending inboard portion 226 of drain channel 220.  Optional seal member 228 can be configured to engage an underside surface of tonneau
sections 16a, 16b, 16n; cross bow members 20, 28, 32, 40, 46; side members 22, 34, 44; or combinations thereof.  It should be appreciated that seal member 228 can also be configured to engage any other feature or portion of tonneau system 12 to provide a
sealing interface to inhibit moisture or other liquids from escaping from drain channel 220 and entering cargo box 102.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 2-5, side rails 210 can further comprise an end member 230 engaging and terminating drain channel 220 to define a reservoir within drain channel 220.  End member 230 can include an extension portion 232 having an outer
shape that is complementary to a cross-sectional profile of drain channel 220 and/or side rails 210 to permit end member 230 to be slipped into an extruded end of side rails 210.  End member 230 can further comprising a fluid passage terminating at an
output flange 234.  A tube or other member 236 can be fastened to output flange 234, if desired, to route moisture or other liquids captured in drain channel 220 to a desired drain point (e.g. beneath the pickup truck).  In this way, moisture and other
liquids can be effectively captured and subsequently drained from the vehicle without damaging cargo box contents, entering cargo box 102, and/or leading to vehicle corrosion.
 Panel Retention Keeper System
 Turning now to FIGS. 2-5, tonneau sections 16a, 16b, and/or 16n can be fixedly coupled to sidewall 108 of cargo box 110 via a panel retention keeper system 300.  In some embodiments, panel retention keeper system 300 can be employed between any
portions of foldable tonneau system 12 that provides sufficient structural integrity.
 In some embodiments, one or more of the plurality of tonneau sections 16a, 16b, and 16n can comprise panel retention keeper system 300.  In particular, panel retention keeper system 300 can include a keeper member 302 downwardly extending from
any suitable structure of tonneau system 12 (e.g. frame network, cross members, side members, etc.).  In some embodiments, keeper member 302 can be fixedly coupled to side member 22, 34, and/or 44.  Keeper member 302 can be fastened thereto using any
suitable method, such as fasteners, bonding, welding, or the like.  In this arrangement, overall packaging of tonneau system 12 is improved, panel retention keeper system 300 is generally maintained in a concealed fashion when engaged, and overall
appearance of tonneau system 12 is maximized.  Moreover, keeper member 302 can be configured, as illustrated herein, to never extend within the volume of cargo box 102.  As will be described, keeper member 302 can be contained with a side rail member
and/or drain channel, thereby preventing any contact between keeper member 302 and contents of cargo box 102 (which may cause damage to one and/or the other).
 As illustrated in FIGS. 2-5, keeper member 302 can be configured and arranged such that during operation of the respective tonneau section 16n, keeper member 302 is automatically engaged and disengaged from a corresponding keeper pin 304.  More
particularly, keeper member 302 can be generally planar and comprise a keeper pin receiving slot 306 formed in or along an engaging edge 308.  In some embodiments, keeper pin receiving slot 306 can define a shape complementary to a cross-sectional shape
of keeper pin 304.  By way of example, keeper pin 304 can be generally cylindrical and, thus, keeper pin receiving slot 306 can be generally circular to receive keeper pin 304 therein.
 Keeper pin 304 can, in some embodiments, be mounted to side rail 210 such that keeper pin 304 is fixedly carried by side rail 210 and, thus, is retained in position relative to side walls 108, 110 of cargo box 102.  In this way, keeper pin 304
forms a rigid connection point for connection with keeper member 302 and the corresponding tonneau section 16n.  As illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, keeper pin 304 can comprise a generally cylindrical cross-section having a first end 316 and a second end
318.  First end 316, in some embodiments, can comprise a trunnion-type end defining a circumferential groove 320 extending thereabout.  Trunnion-type end 316 can be received within a trunnion channel 322 formed in side rail 210.  In some embodiments,
trunnion channel 322 can comprise a C-shaped channel being formed in one or more of angular member 218 and vertically-extending outboard portion 222 of drain channel 220.  The C-shaped trunnion channel 322 can capture trunnion-type end 316 such that
portions of the C-shaped trunnion channel 322 are received within circumferential groove 320.  Second end 318 of keeper pin 304 can be received within an aperture 238 formed in vertically-extending inboard portion 226 of drain channel 220.
 The relative orientation of keeper member 302 and keeper pin 304 provides a number of advantages over conventional designs.  Specifically, as illustrated in FIGS. 2-5 and mentioned herein, keeper member 302 can be fixedly coupled and downwardly
extending from any suitable structure of tonneau system 12 (e.g. frame network, cross members, side members, etc.) and, thus, be carried by the corresponding tonneau section 16a, 16b, 16n.  As tonneau section 16a, 16b, 16n rotates about tonneau hinges
330, keeper member 302 sweeps about an arcuate path that causes keeper member 302 to automatically rotate into and out of engagement with keeper pin 304.  Therefore, as a user opens and closes any one of tonneau sections 16a, 16b, 16n and, thus, rotates
the tonneau section about its hinge 330, keeper member 302 will sweeps out of and into engagement, respectively, with keeper pin 304.  It should be appreciated that, generally, keeper pin receiving slot 306 and keeper pin 304 are aligned at a radial
distance from the axis of rotation of hinge 330.  In this way, keeper pin receiving slot 306 and keeper pin 304 can easily and reliably interconnect through pivotal movement of the tonneau section.
 In some embodiments, keeper pin receiving slot 306 of keeper member 302 is sized and shaped to generally inhibit relative movement in a Z-axis between keeper member 302 (and fixedly associated tonneau section 16a, 16b, 16n) and keeper pin 304
(which, as will be described herein, is fixedly associated with cargo box 110).  Thus, the connection of keeper member 302 and keeper pin 304 can generally inhibit any raising or lowering of the tonneau section 16a, 16b, 16n or tonneau cover relative to
the pickup truck when in a closed and engaged position.  Likewise, the connection of keeper member 302 and keeper pin 304 can serve to inhibit relative movement in at least one direction along an X-axis.  That is, the connection of keeper member 302 and
keeper pin 304 can inhibit movement in a vehicle longitudinal direction that results in keeper pin 304 to be forced further into keeper pin receiving slot 306 of keeper member 302.  In some embodiments, the connection of keeper member 302 with a pair of
keeper pins 304a (see FIG. 4) can serve to inhibit relative movement in both directions along the X-axis.  That is, a first of the pair of keeper pins 304a engages the keeper pin receiving slot 306 of the keeper member 302 preventing movement in a first
direction along the X-axis, while a second of the pair of keeper pins 304a engages a back side of keeper member 302 preventing movement in a second opposite direction along the X-axis.  In some embodiments or in connection with some tonneau sections,
such as tonneau section 16a, a pair of keeper pins 304a may not be necessary, as a latch (such as latch 250, FIG. 2) can serve as a connection inhibiting movement in at least one direction along the X-axis, while the remaining one keeper member 302 and
keeper pin 304 combination can serve to inhibit movement in both directions along the Z-axis and at least one direction along the X-axis.
 Unlike the prior art, the present teachings provide a tonneau cover system that provides an advantageous retention system that securely retains the tonneau cover in a closed positions and permits simple and convenient disengagement of the
retention system when opening the tonneau system or otherwise gaining access to the cargo box.  The present teachings also provide a tonneau cover system having a drain system to safely drain water and/or prevent other contaminants from entering the
cargo box.
 The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description.  It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the disclosure.  Individual elements or features of a particular embodiment are
generally not limited to that particular embodiment, but, where applicable, are interchangeable and can be used in a selected embodiment, even if not specifically shown or described.  The same may also be varied in many ways.  Such variations are not to
be regarded as a departure from the disclosure, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the disclosure.

 This application corresponds to PCT/EP2009/008763, filed Dec.  8, 2009, which claims the benefit of German Application No. 10 2008 061 613.3, filed Dec.  11, 2008, the subject matter, of which is incorporated herein by reference in their
entirety.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 The invention relates to a device for fastening a vehicle inner lining to a lining support, having a holding element and a receiving element, the receiving element having a latching portion into which the holding element can engage such that it
is fastened to the receiving element in an axial direction.
 Nowadays, motor vehicle bodies including present body attachment parts are lined for optical and technical reasons.  Vehicle doors therefore include, for example, a lining support and an interior door lining, i.e. a door lining facing the
vehicle interior, which is fastened to the lining support.  The lining support and the door lining usually include a plurality of latching elements cooperating with each other when the door lining is mounted such that the door lining can be clipped on
the lining support.
 If an axis is defined perpendicularly to the door plane, the mounting of the door lining is carried out in the axial direction.  Since the mounting is realized manually, the force for clipping in the latching elements must not be too large. 
However, at the same time, the latching connection should ensure that a receiving space between the door lining and the lining support for door locking elements, power windows, ventilation components or the like is protected against an ingress of water
and dust.  Furthermore, the door lining should not be detached from the lining support even if a vehicle occupant does not close the vehicle door in the usual way, namely by means of the door handle, but uses, for example, a storage compartment provided
in the door lining for closing the vehicle door.
 Furthermore, the vehicle inner lining should permit a repeated mounting and demounting so that, e.g., maintenance or repair works can be effected in the receiving space between the lining support and the vehicle inner lining.  Contrary to the
requirements specified above, a latching connection would be desirable in this case, which can be released as easily as possible.
 Moreover, conventional latching connections have the problem that after a repeated mounting and demounting, due to the wear of the latching elements, the vehicle inner lining can no longer be fastened such that a predefined axial tensile force
on the vehicle inner lining can be absorbed by the latching elements.
 It is therefore usual to secure the latching connection between the lining support and the vehicle inner lining by means of a screw which constitutes an increased mounting and demounting expenditure.  The screw is furthermore screwed through the
vehicle inner lining into the lining support and is therefore visible in the vehicle interior or has to be covered by a cover.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The object of the invention is to provide a fastening device for a vehicle inner lining which has a high resistance to a detachment of the fastening in case of usual stress and permits at the same time a simple mounting and demounting of the
vehicle inner lining.
 According to the invention, the object is achieved by a fastening device of the type initially mentioned, in which the latching portion is open laterally.  As a consequence of this laterally open latching portion, there is the possibility upon
demounting the vehicle inner lining to release the latching connection laterally, i.e. obliquely with respect to the axial mounting direction and the usual stress direction, rather than parallel thereto.  Accordingly, the latching connection can be
configured for a larger axial extracting force since it is no longer necessary to overcome the latter upon demounting.  The material wear on the latching portion and on the holding element is furthermore so low in such a demounting procedure that even in
case of a repeated mounting and demounting of the vehicle inner lining, an almost unchanged axial extraction resistance of the fastening device is maintained.
 In a preferred embodiment, the holding element can be shifted laterally in the latching portion such that it can move laterally out of the latching portion, in particular in a radial direction with respect to the axial direction.
 The invention also comprises a method of mounting and demounting a vehicle inner lining to or from a lining support by means of a device having a holding element associated with the vehicle inner lining and a receiving element associated with
the lining support, the holding element being pressed axially into the receiving element during mounting, and the holding element being shifted in a lateral, in particular in a radial direction with respect to the axial direction during demounting, the
holding element being thus detached from the receiving element.  This method permits a mounting of the vehicle inner lining in the axial direction by means of at least one fastening device according to the invention and, if necessary, further
conventional fastening devices.  The resulting latching connection of the fastening device according to the invention can form a particularly high axial extraction resistance during mounting since upon demounting, the latching connection is released by a
movement in the lateral, preferably in the radial direction, rather than in the axial direction.  Accordingly, a separate locking screw for increasing the axial extraction resistance is no longer necessary.  Furthermore, the demounting is in particular a
careful demounting with regard to the material wear such that the fastening device has an almost unchanged axial extraction resistance and a good sealing between the vehicle inner lining and the lining support against water and dust, even after a
repeated mounting and demounting.
 Suitable configurations of the invention and advantages thereof will be apparent from the dependent claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS
 FIG. 1 shows a vehicle door 10 having a lining support 12 and a vehicle inner lining 14.  In the present case, the lining support 12 is a door metal sheet, a module support or a stiffening strut of the vehicle door 10; alternatively, it can
however be a piece of the vehicle body, which is to be lined.  In the embodiment according to FIG. 1, the vehicle inner lining 14 is a door lining 14 including, among other things, a storage compartment 16 for storing smaller objects such as a parking
disk, an ice scraper, maps or the like.  Since this storage compartment 16 can also be used in an improper way to close the door (cf.  arrow 19) instead of using a door handle 17 of the vehicle door 10, the door lining 14 must be reliably fastened to the
lining support 12 so that it is not detached from the lining support 12 when the vehicle door 10 is closed.
 In order to prevent such an unintended demounting of the door lining 14, a locking screw 18 is usually provided in the prior art, which is screwed through the door lining 14 into the lining support 12.
 FIG. 2 shows a device 20 for fastening the door lining 14 to the lining support 12.  When using one or more of these fastening devices 20, it is possible to dispense with the optically disturbing locking screw 18 of FIG. 1.  Here, the fastening
device 20 is generally used in addition to conventional latching elements (not shown) which are distributed over the lining support 12 and the door lining 14 so that the door lining 14 can be simply clipped into the lining support 12 by a movement in the
axial direction A. In this context, a direction perpendicular to the door plane, which corresponds in FIG. 1 approximately to a longitudinal direction of the locking screw 18, is referred to as an axial direction A. The fastening device 20 is preferably
used in the region of large axial extraction forces at the edge of the door lining 14, i.e. in particular in the region of the locking screw 18 (cf.  FIG. 1).
 According to FIG. 2, the fastening device 20 comprises a holding element 22 and a receiving element 24, the receiving element 24 having a latching portion 26 into which the holding element 22 can engage such that it is fastened to the receiving
element 24 in the axial direction.  In addition to the holding element 22 and the receiving element 24, FIG. 2 also shows a detail of the lining support 12 and a fastening part 28 which serves to fasten the holding element 22 to the door lining 14.
 Details of the specified components are now described more precisely below with reference to FIGS. 3 to 5.
 FIG. 3 shows the fastening part 28 for fixing the holding element 22 to the door lining 14 (see also FIG. 9), the fastening part 28 being directly integrated into the door lining 14 in a particular variant.
 FIG. 4 shows on the left a perspective view and on the right a lateral view of the holding element 22.  The holding element 22 generally has the shape of a pin and includes two latching noses 30 at an axial end.  At the opposed axial end, the
holding element 22 has a rectangular pin head 32 which serves to fasten the holding element 22 to the fastening part 28.  The holding element 22 is provided with two elastic wings 36 which are separated from the pin head 32 merely by a short neck portion
34 and the free ends of which rest against the receiving element 24 in the mounted state of the fastening device 20.  The fastening device 20 is elastically prestressed by means of these wings 36 so that no rattling can occur later in the operation of
the vehicle.
 FIG. 5 shows on the left a perspective view and on the right a top view of the receiving element 24.  The latching portion 26 of the receiving element 24 has an undercut 38 which can be engaged by the holding element 22, more precisely by a
latching nose 30 of the holding element 22.  In the embodiment illustrated, even two symmetrically arranged undercuts 38 are provided (FIG. 5, on the right), which are each formed by an obliquely positioned latching projection 40.  The latching
projections 40 are here configured so as to be elastic so that they are pushed apart by the holding element 22 upon axial mounting of the door lining 14, and snap back into their initial position behind the latching noses 30.  Therefore, the axial
extraction resistance between the holding element 22 and the receiving element 24 is substantially determined by the shaping of the latching noses 30 and the latching projections 40.
 Furthermore, FIG. 5 clearly shows that the latching portion 26 is open laterally, i.e. transversally to the axis A, in particular radially to the axis A (see also FIGS. 2 and 4).  For a demounting of the door lining 14, i.e. a detachment of the
holding element 22 from the receiving element 24, a new deformation of the latching projections 40 is not necessary after the latching projections 40 have snapped back.  The holding element 22 can be shifted laterally in the latching portion 26 such that
it can move out of the latching portion laterally, in particular in a radial direction with respect to the axial direction.  According to the right part of FIG. 5, the holding element 22 is shifted radially upwards relative to the receiving element 24
until the latching noses 30 no longer engage the latching projections 40.
 The receiving element 24 is preferably pre-mounted to the lining support 12.  FIG. 6 shows a sequence scheme for pre-mounting the receiving element 24.  The receiving element 24 comprises an anchoring portion 42 by means of which it can be
mounted to the lining support 12 in a vehicle-fixed manner.  The receiving element 24 is further provided with a seal 44 in order to seal a receiving space in the vehicle door 10 between the lining support 12 and the door lining 14 with respect to a
vehicle environment.
 To pre-mount the receiving element 24 to the lining support 12, the anchoring portion 42, more precisely two anchoring projections 46 of the anchoring portion 42 that are located opposite each other, are moved in the axial direction through an
opening 48 in the lining support 12 (see FIG. 6a).  The anchoring portion 42 is configured such that the anchoring projections 46 pass completely through the opening 48 under axial deformation of the seal 44 (FIG. 6b).  In this position, the receiving
element 24 can be rotated about the axis A relative to the lining support 12.  According to FIG. 6c, the receiving element 24 has been rotated through approximately 90.degree..  The opening 48 in the lining support 12 has a cross-section which after this
rotation does not permit any axial movement of the receiving element 24 against its direction of mounting.  Due to the elastic deformation of the seal 44, the lining support 12 and the receiving element 24 are axially prestressed against each other and
are connected with each other in the axial and in the radial direction.  In other words, the receiving element 24 is fastened to the lining support 12 of the vehicle door 10 by means of a bayonet connection.  In its final position according to FIG. 6c,
this bayonet connection can of course have a rotation stop or a little latching means to exactly define the final position.
 Before its mounting to the receiving element 24, the holding element 22 is also pre-mounted to the fastening part 28, more specifically by means of a sliding-latching connection, the fastening part being in turn attached to the door lining 14. 
For this purpose, according to FIG. 7a, the holding element 22 is moved radially onto the fastening part 28 (arrow 49), whereby the pin head 32 of the holding element 22 is received in a rectangular receiving pocket 50 which has an end wall 52 having a
slot 54 in the form of a keyhole.  At the narrowest point, a slot width is preferably smaller than a dimension of the neck portion 34 so that the holding element 22 snaps into its final position according to FIG. 7b and is captively fixed with respect to
the fastening part 28.  Though the ratio of sizes in FIGS. 7a and 7b is illustrated in a slightly distorted way, the inner dimensions of the receiving pocket 50 correspond approximately to the dimensions of the pin head 32 so that no relative rotation
about the axis A is possible.  With respect to the axis A, the holding element 22 is connected to the fastening part 28 for joint rotation therewith.
 After the pre-mounting of the receiving element 24 to the lining support 12 and of the holding element 22 to the fastening part 28 or door lining 14, the door lining 14 can now be mounted to the lining support 12.  For this purpose, according to
FIG. 8a, the door lining 14 or the fastening part 28 rigidly connected with the door lining 14 is merely moved in the axial direction (arrow 56) towards the lining support 12.  The holding element 22 of the fastening device 20 then latches into the
latching portion 26 of the receiving element 24 under deformation of the latching projections 40 and of the elastic wings 36, so that the mounting substantially corresponds to a conventional mounting of the door lining 14 using conventional latching
elements.  This mounted latched position is shown in FIG. 8b.
 In contrast to conventional demounting methods, this latching connection is not released by an axial tensile force against the mounting direction upon demounting of the door lining 14, but rather by a lateral, in particular approximately radial
shifting of the holding element 22 relative to the receiving element 24 (arrow 58).  Since the latching portion 26 in the receiving element 24 is open laterally, the holding element 22 can move out of the receiving element 24 in a lateral direction,
whereby the latching connection between the holding element 22 and the receiving element 24 is released (see FIG. 8c).
 The demounting procedure is described again in more detail with reference to FIGS. 9a to 9c using the example of the vehicle door 10 according to FIG. 1.  The fastening device 20 is provided instead of the locking screw 18, but approximately in
the region thereof.  FIGS. 9a to 9c show a schematic cross-section through the vehicle door 10 and this fastening device 20.
 According to FIG. 9a, the door lining 14 is in its mounted position relative to the lining support 12, in which it has a high axial extraction resistance.  At the edge of the door lining 14, the fastening part 28 is rigidly connected with the
door lining 14 and even integrated into the door lining 14.
 If it is now intended to demount the door lining 14 from the lining support 12, an approximately radially oriented force F has to be applied in the region of the fastening part 28.
 Owing to this force F, the edge of the door lining 14 is deformed elastically (FIG. 9b).  As a result of this deformation, the fastening part 28 and the holding element 22 fixed thereto perform a movement in an approximately radial direction so
that the holding element 22 can move laterally out of the latching portion 26 of the receiving element 24 (FIG. 9c).
 After the release of the latching connection(s) of the fastening device(s) 20, the door lining 14 is moved in the axial direction away from the lining support 12, whereby, optionally, further latching connections having conventional latching
elements are released.  In fact, the conventional latching elements form a latching connection upon the axial mounting movement, which is released again in case of an opposite axial demounting movement.
 Therefore, the fastening device 20 generally permits a fastening of the door lining 14 to the lining support 12, this fastening being particularly impervious to water and dust, having a high extraction resistance and further permitting a
repeated mounting and demounting for an approximately constant connection quality.  Furthermore, the method of mounting and demounting the door lining 14 proves to be particularly simple when using the fastening device 20.

 2.  Description of the Related Art
 Referring now to FIG. 1, a vehicle door lining of a related art will be discussed hereinafter in order to facilitate understanding the present invention.  This vehicle door lining includes a lining body 1 and a decorative component 2 such as a
trim panel for a door arm rest that is combined with the lining body 1 to form the door arm rest.  The lining body 1 has a first arm rest forming part 1a and a groove 1b formed in the lining body 1 so as to surround the first arm rest forming part 1a. 
The trim panel 2 has a second arm rest forming part 2a.  The trim panel 2 is fitted at a periphery thereof into the groove 1b of the lining body 1 with the second arm rest forming part 1b covering the first arm rest forming part 1a, whereby the door arm
rest is formed.  Such a vehicle door lining is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. Hei.  6-87018.
 In the vehicle door lining, there is a possible that noise will be generated by rubbing between the lining body 1 and the trim panel 2 which occurs due to vibration of a vehicle body during driving of a vehicle.
 In order to prevent the noise from being generated, it is conceivable that, as shown in FIG. 2, a noise-preventing member 30 is attached or bonded to at least a region of a periphery 20a of a trim panel 20 so as to be wound around the region of
the periphery 20a of the trim panel 20 and the trim panel 20 is combined with a lining body 10 with the region of the periphery thereof being abutted against an inner surface of the lining body 10 through the noise-preventing member 30.
 However, when the trim panel 20 having the noise-preventing member 30 merely wound around the region of the periphery 20a thereof is combined with the lining body 10, a part 30a of the noise-preventing member 30 is exposed between a general
surface of the trim panel 20 and the lining body 10 so as to be visible from the outside, which presents an undesirable visual appearance.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle door lining comprising a lining body and a decorative component combined with the lining body, in which a good visual appearance can be presented and noise can be positively
prevented from being generated by rubbing between the lining body and the decorative component which occurs due to vibration of a vehicle body during driving of a vehicle.
 In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a vehicle door lining comprising a lining body having a step portion, a decorative component to be combined with the lining body, the decorative component including a periphery having a
tip surface and an outer surface extending from the tip surface, and at least one stepped cut-out portion extending from the tip surface to the outer surface, the decorative component being combined with the lining body with the tip surface being abutted
against an inner surface of the lining body and with the outer surface being surface-contacted with the step portion of the lining body, and at least one noise-preventing member for preventing noise from being generated by rubbing between the lining body
and the decorative component which occurs due to vibration of a vehicle body during driving of the vehicle, the at least one noise-preventing member being attached to the periphery of the decorative component in such a manner that it is received in the
at least one stepped cut-out portion so as to extend continuously with a general surface of the decorative component and be flush with the general surface of the decorative component, and wound around the region of the periphery of the decorative
component, so that the decorative component is combined with the lining body with the tip surface being abutted against the inner surface of the lining body and with the outer surface being surface-contacted with the step portion of the lining body,
through the at least one noise-preventing member.
 In the vehicle door lining according to the present invention, generation of noise by rubbing between the lining body and the decorative component which occurs due to the vibration of the vehicle body during the driving of the vehicle can be
positively prevented by the noise-preventing member.  The noise-preventing member is attached to the periphery of the decorative component in such a manner that it is received in the stepped cut-out portion so as to extend continuously from the general
surface of the decorative component and be flush with the general surface of the decorative component, and wound around the periphery of the decorative component.  Therefore, the noise-preventing member is not visible from the outside between the general
surface of the decorative component and the step portion of the lining body with which the periphery of the decorative component is surface-contacted.  Moreover, the noise-preventing member is attached to the periphery of the decorative component so as
to be received in the stepped cut-out portion, so that the noise-preventing member is hard to be removed from the periphery of the decorative component.  In addition, the attaching of the noise-preventing member to the periphery of the decorative
component can be performed while causing edges of the noise-preventing member to be positioned with respect to the stepped cut-out portion.  Therefore, it is possible to precisely bond the noise-preventing member to the stepped cut-out portion.
 The noise-preventing member may be formed of felt or non woven fabric.  The stepped cut-out portion may be provided along an entire region of the periphery.  In this case, a plurality of the noise-preventing members may be attached to the
periphery.  Alternatively, the noise-preventing member may be elongated and attached to the periphery so as to extend along the entire region of the periphery.  Also, a plurality of the stepped cut-out portions may be provided at regions of the
periphery.  In this case, a plurality of the noise-preventing members may be attached to the periphery so as to be received in the stepped cut-out portions.
 The decorative component may be a trim panel for forming a door arm rest in cooperation with the lining body.
 Other objects and many of the attendant advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 Like the vehicle door lining shown in FIG. 1, a vehicle door lining according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a lining body and a decorative component such as a trim panel for a door arm rest.  Incidentally, in FIGS. 3 and 4
which illustrate the embodiment of the present invention, components which are substantially similar to those of the vehicle door lining shown in FIG. 2 are designated by like reference numerals.
 Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, the vehicle door lining according to the embodiment of the present invention will be discussed hereinafter.  As shown in FIG. 3, the lining body 10 of the vehicle door lining according to the embodiment of the
present invention includes a three-dimensional substrate 12 formed of a synthetic resin material such as a PP (polypropylene) resin, a shock absorbing layer 14 formed of urethane foam or the like on a portion of a surface of the substrate 12, and a sheet
16 of covering material such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) or the like laminated on the shock absorbing layer 14.  The lining body 10 is to be applied and fixed to a vehicle door panel (not shown).
 The trim panel 20 of the door lining according to the embodiment of the present invention includes a pre-formed decorative film 22 and a substrate 24 formed of a synthetic resin such as ABS resin and integrated with the decorative film 22.  The
substrate 24 is formed integrally with the pre-formed decorative film 22 by a forming mold for forming the trim panel 20.  More particularly, the pre-formed decorative film 22 is set in the forming mold and a synthetic resin for the substrate 24 is
poured into the forming mold, whereby the trim panel 20 which includes the decorative film 22 and the substrate 24 integrated with the decorative film 22 is formed.
 The lining body 10 has a first arm rest forming portion (not shown).  The trim panel 20 has a second arm rest forming portion (not shown).  The trim panel 20 is combined with the lining body 10 in such a manner that the second arm rest forming
portion of the trim panel 20 is aligned and combined with the first arm rest forming portion of the lining body 10, to thereby form the door arm rest R.
 The trim panel 20 further includes a noise-preventing member 30 attached or bonded to a region of a periphery 24a of the substrate 24 so as to be wound around the region of the periphery 24a for preventing noise from being generated by rubbing
between the combined lining body 10 and trim panel 20 which occurs due to vibration of a vehicle body B of a vehicle during driving of the vehicle provided with the door lining according to the embodiment of the present invention.  When the trim panel 20
is combined with the lining body 10, the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 of the trim panel 20 is abutted against an inner surface of the lining body 10 through the noise-preventing member 30 attached or bonded to the region of the periphery 24a of the
substrate 24 of the trim panel 20.
 When the trim panel 2 is formed by the forming mold, a stepped cut-out portion 26 is formed at the region of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 at the same time.  The stepped cut-out portion 26 is formed so as to extend from a tip surface
24a' of the region of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 to an area of an outer surface of the region of the periphery 24a which is surface-contacted with a surface of a step portion 10a of the lining body 10 when the trim panel 20 is combined with
the lining body 10.  The pre-formed decorative film 22 is attached onto an outer surface portion of the substrate 24 except the stepped cut-out portion 26 of the substrate 24.
 The stepped cut-out portion 26 is formed so as to have a depth substantially corresponding to a thickness of the noise-preventing member 30.  The noise-preventing member 30 is received in the stepped cut-out portion 26 so as to extend
continuously from an edge of the pre-formed decorative film 22 and be flush with a surface of the pre-formed decorative film 22, and attached or bonded to the region of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 so as to be wound around the region of the
periphery 24a.  Thus, the noise-preventing member 30 is attached or bonded to the substrate 24 of the trim panel 20 so as to be flush with a general surface of the trim panel 20.
 The noise-preventing member 30 is formed of felt, non woven fabric, or the like.  When the noise-preventing member 30 having a thickness of, for example, 0.5 mm is employed, the depth D of the stepped cut-out portion 26 may be set to about 0.5
mm, a thickness T of the tip surface 24a' of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 may be set to about 2 mm, and a length L of a region of the stepped cut-out portion 26 which extends from the tip surface 24a' of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 may
be set to about 5 mm.
 As discussed above, the noise-preventing member 30 is attached or bonded to the region of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 in such a manner that it is received in the stepped cut-out portion 26 so as to extend continuously from the edge of
the decorative film 22 and be flush with the surface of the decorative film 22, and wound around the periphery 24a of the substrate 24.  Therefore, the noise-preventing member 30 is not visible from the outside between the general surface of the trim
panel 20 and the surface of the step portion 10a of the lining body 10 with which the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 is surface-contacted.  Moreover, the noise-preventing member 30 is attached or bonded to the region of the periphery 24a of the
substrate 24 so as to be received in the stepped cut-out portion 26, so that the noise-preventing member 30 is hard to be removed from the substrate 24.  In addition, the attaching of the noise-preventing member 30 to the region of the periphery 24a of
the substrate 24 can be performed while causing edges of the noise-preventing member 30 to be positioned with respect to the stepped cut-out portion 26.  Therefore, it is possible to precisely bond the noise-preventing member 30 to the stepped cut-out
portion 26.
 As shown in FIG. 4, the substrate 24 of the trim panel 20 has a base portion 24b provided on an inner surface thereof, a screw receiving post 24c protruding from the base portion 24b, and two or four spaced apart reinforcing-ribs 24d provided
around the screw receiving post 24c and extending along an axial direction of the screw receiving post 24c.  The base portion 24b is formed in a bridge shape which allows the base portion 24b to be broken when subjected to impact.  The trim panel 20 is
fixed to the lining body 10 by causing the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 to be abutted against the inner surface of the lining body 10 through the noise-preventing member 30 and causing a tapping screw 40 to be threaded into the screw receiving post
24c from an outer side of the lining body 10.
 Referring now to FIG. 5, there is illustrated a modification of the fixing structure of FIG. 4 for fixing the trim panel 20 to the lining body 10.  The modification is substantially similar to the fixing structure of FIG. 4 except that a
riveting stem 24e is employed in lieu of the screw receiving post 24c and the tapping screw 40 is not used.  In FIG. 5, components which are substantially similar to those shown in FIG. 4 are denoted with like reference numerals.  The riveting stem 24e
protrudes from the base portion 24b of the substrate 24.  Two or four spaced apart reinforcing-ribs 24f are provided around the riveting stem 24e so as to extend along an axial direction of the riveting stem 24e.  According to this modification, the trim
panel 20 is fixedly attached to the lining body 10 by causing the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 to be abutted against the inner surface of the substrate 12 of the lining body 10 through the noise-preventing member 30, causing the riveting stem 24e to
be inserted through a through-hole 10b formed in the substrate 12 of the lining body 10, and causing a head of the riveting stem 24e to be riveted over an outer surface of the substrate 12 of the lining body 10.
 In FIGS. 4 and 5, reference numeral 50 denotes an upper cover which is combined with the lining body 10.  A region of the periphery of the substrate 24 of the trim panel 20 which is contacted with the upper cover 50 may be also provided with a
noise-preventing member.
 In the vehicle door lining structured as discussed above, the trim panel 20 is fixedly attached to the lining body 10 in such a manner that the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 of the trim panel 20 which is provided with the noise-preventing
member 30 is abutted against the inner surface of the substrate 12 of the lining body 10 through the noise-preventing member 30.  Therefore, noise can be positively prevented from being generated by rubbing between the trim panel 20 and the lining body
10 which occurs due to the vibration of the vehicle body during driving of the vehicle.  In addition, the noise-preventing member 30 is attached or bonded to the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 of the trim panel 20 in such a manner that it is received
in the stepped cut-out portion 26 of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 so as to extend continuously from the edge of the decorative film 22 and be flush with the surface of the decorative film 22, and wound around the periphery 24a of the substrate
24.  Therefore, the noise-preventing member 30 is not visible from the outside between the general surface of the trim panel 20 and the surface of the step portion 10a of the lining body 10 with which the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 of the trim
panel 20 is surface-contacted.  Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided the vehicle door lining having a good visual appearance.
 While the case where the stepped cut-out portion 26 is formed at the region of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 has been discussed above, a plurality of stepped cut-out portions 26 (only one of the stepped cut-out portions 26 is shown in
FIGS. 3 to 5, for example) may be formed at regions of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 or the stepped cut-out portion 26 may be formed along an entire region of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24.  In this case, a plurality of noise-preventing
members 30 (only one of the noise-preventing members 30 is shown in FIGS. 3 to 5, for example) may be attached or bonded to the regions of the periphery 24a of the substrate 24 in the same manner as discussed above, or an elongated noise-preventing
member may be attached or bonded to the entire periphery 24a of the substrate 24 in the same manner as discussed above.  Moreover, while the case where the trim panel for the arm rest is employed as the decorative component has been discussed above, a
decorative component such as a center pad may be employed as the decorative component.
 The terms and expressions which have been employed herein are used as terms of description and not of limitation.  There is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions to exclude any equivalents of the features shown and described, or
any portion thereof.  It is recognized, however, that various modifications are possible within the scope of the invention claimed.

 This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-101300 filed Apr.  28, 2011.  The entire content of this priority application is incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The present disclosure relates to a door trim for a vehicle.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 A known door trim for a vehicle includes a trim body (or a trim board) and an armrest projecting toward the inner side of the interior of the vehicle and mounted to the trim body.  The armrest has a flange.  The armrest is mounted to the trim
board with bosses formed on the trim board fitted in holes of the flange.
 Such an armrest needs to be easily deformed in the direction in which the armrest projects (i.e., in the horizontal direction of the vehicle) in a side collision.  In the side collision, the armrest may hit an occupant of the vehicle.  If the
armrest is easily deformed, the impact on the occupant can be reduced.  To make the armrest easily deformable, the armrest of the known door trim has a step between the flange and a body of the armrest so that the armrest easily breaks at the step in a
side collision.
 However, the armrest of the known door trim may not have sufficient rigidity for a downward force applied thereto, for example, when the occupant places his or her arm on the armrest.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The technology described herein has been made in view of the aforementioned circumstances.  An objective of the technology is to provide a door trim having high rigidity for a downward force applied to an armrest and configured such that an
impact on an occupant by the armrest in a side collision is reduced.
 A door trim for a vehicle includes a trim body and an armrest.  The trim body has an armrest mount hole, a mount member, and a support member.  The mount member is arranged in an edge area of the armrest mount hole.  The armrest is fitted in the
armrest mount hole.  The armrest has a mount base to which the mount member is mounted.  The mount base has a weak portion.  The mount base is configured to be supported by the support member.  The weak portion has lower rigidity than another portion of
the mount base.  The support member is configured to guide the mount base toward an outer side of an interior of the vehicle.
 With the weak portion of the mount base, the weak portion is easily deformed (or broken) when a force is applied to the armrest from the inner side of the interior in a side collision.  As a result, the armrest is deformed and thus the impact on
an occupant of the vehicle in the side collision can be reduced.
 According to the technology described herein, the strength of the door trim to the load applied to the armrest from above can be increased and impact on the occupant in a side collision can be reduced.  Namely, a door trim that can exert such
effects can be provided. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
First Embodiment
 The first embodiment will be explained with reference to FIGS. 1 to 6.  A door trim 11 is mounted on an inner side of a vehicular body panel (not illustrated) with clips (not illustrated).  As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the door trim 11
includes a trim board 20 (a trim board body), a speaker grill 12, a switch base 13, and an inside handle well 14.  The trim board 20 is made of synthetic resin or synthetic resin mixed with natural fibers such as kenaf fibers.
 The trim board 20 has a board mount hole 21 (an armrest mount hole) around the center thereof with respect to the vertical direction and closer to the rear edge thereof.  A board 15 having an ornament 16 and an armrest 40 is fitted in the board
mount hole 21.  As illustrated in FIG. 5, the armrest 40 is formed by projecting a lower edge portion of the board 15 toward the inner side of the interior of the vehicle (toward the right in FIG. 5) so as to form a step.  Namely, the ornament 16 and the
armrest 40 are integrally formed.
 Next, the board 15 and configurations around the armrest 40 will be explained.  As illustrated in FIG. 2, the board 15 is mounted to the outer side of the trim board 20.  The board 15 has a substantially trapezoidal shape with a width measuring
in the front-rear direction of the vehicle decreasing toward the bottom.
 As illustrated in FIG. 3, the board 15 has a board portion and a raised portion raised from the board portion.  The raised portion includes a rising wall 41 that rises from the edge of the board portion toward the outer side of the interior of
the vehicle.  A peripheral wall 42 projects from the edge of the rising wall 41 and extends in the direction in which the trim board 20 extends.  A skin 17 is attached to the surface of the board 15 on the inner side of the interior of the vehicle so as
to cover the surface (see FIG. 5).
 As illustrated in FIG. 2, a plurality of mount tabs 43 extend outward from the peripheral wall 42.  The mount tabs 43 are arranged along the periphery of the board 15 at predetermined intervals.  As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, mount bosses 22
are provided around the edge of the board mount hole 21 of the trim board at positions corresponding to the mount tabs 43.  The mount bosses 22 project from the outer surface 20B of the trim board 20 on the outer side of the interior of the vehicle
toward the outer side of the interior of the vehicle.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, each mount tab 43 has an insertion hole 45 that extends through the mount tab 43 in the width direction of the vehicle.  The mount boss 22 is inserted in the insertion hole 45.  A distal end of the mount boss 22
is welded or fused by ultrasonic welding after the mount boss 22 is inserted in the insertion hole 45.  In FIGS. 3 and 4, the distal end of the boss 22 is in a condition before welding.  In FIG. 4, the distal end of the mount boss 22 after the welding is
illustrated by a chain double-dashed line.  The distal end after the welding is referred to as a welded portion 23.  FIGS. 3 and 4 are magnified views of an area K encircled by a chain line in FIG. 2 including the mounting tab 43, a projection 24, and
their peripheral areas.  The projection 24 will be explained later.
 With the welded portion 23 covering the edge of the insertion hole 45 of the mount tab 43 from the outer side of the interior of the vehicle, the mount boss 22 is less likely to come out of the insertion hole 45.  As a result, the mount tab 43
is properly attached to the trim board 20 and the board 15 is properly mounted to the trim board 20.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, the trim board 20 has the projection 24 (a support member or a projection) which supports the mount tab 43 or the armrest 40.  As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, the projection 24 is arranged below one of the mount
tabs 43 (referred to as the mount tab 43A) located at a rear end of the armrest 40 closer to the rear of the vehicle (a first end of the armrest, one of ends of the armrest with respect to the front-rear direction of the vehicle).  The mount tab 43A may
be located at a rear end corner of the armrest 40.
 The projection 24 has a substantially U-shape with an open end at a lower side when viewed from the front as in FIG. 4.  The projection 24 projects from the outer surface 20B of the trim board 20 toward the outer side of the interior of the
vehicle.  When a downward force is applied to the armrest from above, an upper surface 24A of the projection 24 supports a lower surface 43A1 of the mount tab 43A.  By forming the projection 24 in the substantially U-shape, the rigidity of the projection
24 can be increased.
 As illustrated in FIG. 4, the upper surface 24A of the projection 24 and the lower surface 43A1 of the mount tab 43A are arranged with a small gap therebetween.  When the armrest 40 (or the mount tab 43A) moves downward, the mount tab 43A
contacts the upper surface 24A of the projection 24.  Namely, the mount tab 43A is supported by the projection 24.
 When the armrest 40 moves toward the outer side of the interior of the vehicle relative to the door trim 11 due to a load applied from the inner side of the interior of the vehicle (or a lateral force), the mount tab 43A moves toward the outer
side of the interior along the upper surface 24A of the projection 24.  Namely, the projection 24 guides the mount tab 43A toward the outer side (or toward the left in FIG. 5).
 The mount tab 43A has a plurality of weak portions.  The weak portions are provided to make the mount tab 43A easily deformed (or broken) when a force is applied to the armrest 40 from the inner side of the interior in a side collision.
 A through hole 46, a cutout 47, and a slit 48 illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 are formed in the weak portions.  The through hole 46 extends along a boundary between the mount tab 43A and the rising wall 41 (or a base end of the mount tab 43A).  The
cutout 47 is formed by cutting out a part of the armrest 40 around a connecting portion between the mount tab 43A and the peripheral wall 42.  As illustrated in FIG. 4, the slit 48 continues from the insertion hole 45 and extends to the peripheral edge
(or the distal end) of the mount tab 43A.
 The weak portions including the through hole 46, the cutout 47, and the slit 48, respectively, are formed in areas of the mount tab 43A other than an area to be in contact with the projection 24 (i.e., an area to be supported by the projection
24).  More specifically, the cutout 47 and the slit 48 are formed in areas that do not overlap the projection 24 with respect to the front-rear direction of the vehicle (or the horizontal direction in FIG. 4).
 Furthermore, a notch 49 is formed at a lower edge portion of the armrest 40 so as to extend in the width direction of the vehicle.  A lower edge support member 25 projecting from the outer surface 20B of the trim board 20 toward the outer side
of the interior is fitted in the notch 49.  The lower edge support member 25 extends in the width direction of the vehicle.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 6, the lower edge support member 25 is brought into contact with a back wall 49A of the notch 49 when a downward force is applied to the armrest from above.  With this configuration, the lower edge support member 25
supports the armrest 40.  Because the lower edge support member 25 that extends in the width direction of the vehicle is fitted in the notch 49 that also extends in the width direction, the movement of the armrest in the front-rear direction of the
vehicle is restricted.  Furthermore, with the above configuration, the armrest 40 is guided toward the outer side of the interior.  An enforcement rib 26 is connected between the lower surface of the lower edge support member 25 and the outer surface 20B
of the trim board 20B.  With this configuration, the lower edge support member 25 is provided with high rigidity.
 Next, effects of this embodiments will be explained.  The mount tab 43A of the armrest 40 has the weak portions including the through hole 46, the cutout 47, and the slit 48, respectively.  With this configuration, the mount tab 43A is easily
deformed or broken when a load is applied to the armrest 40 from the inner side of the interior in the side collision.  Therefore, the armrest 40 is easily deformed and thus the impact on the occupant in the side collision can be reduced.
 The mount tab 43A of the armrest 40 is supported by the projection 24 of the trim board 20.  With this configuration, the mount tab 43A is supported by the projection 24 when a downward force is applied to the armrest 40 from above, that is, the
rigidity of the armrest 40 increases.  Even though the mount tab 43A has the weak portions, the strength of the armrest 40 against the downward force applied thereto from above can be increased.
 The armrest 40 is usually used by an occupant for placing his or her arm on the upper surface 40A thereof (see FIG. 5) from the inner side of the interior.  When the armrest 40 is used in such a condition, an oblique downward force toward the
outer side of the interior is applied thereto (indicated by symbol F1 in FIG. 5).
 If the projection 24 is not provided, the mount tab 43A moves toward the outer side of the interior by the force F1.  As a result, a load concentrates at the welded portion 23 of the mount boss 22.  The moving direction of the mount tab 43A is
indicated by arrow D1 in FIG. 5.  The welded portion 23 tends to receive a load by which the welded portion 23 comes off toward the outer side of the interior.
 The movement of the mount tab 43A is restricted by the projection 24 that supports the mount tab 43A.  A length L1 of the projection 24 measuring from the mount tab 43A to the distal end of the projection 24 in the width direction of the
vehicle, that is, the horizontal direction in FIG. 5 may be set to 5 mm or longer.  With this configuration, the restriction of the movement of the mount tab 43A by the projection 24 is made more reliable.  However, the projection 24 can be provided in
any length.
 The projection 24 is configured to guide the mount tab 43A toward the outer side of the interior of the vehicle.  In a side collision, the armrest 40 may receive a load from the inner side of the interior and move toward the outer side of the
interior relative to the trim board 20.  In such a case, the mount tab 43A moves toward the outer side of the interior relative to the projection 24.  In the side collision, the movement of the mount tab 43A toward the outer side of the interior is less
likely to be restricted by the projection 24.  Therefore, the impact on the occupant in the side collision can be reduced.
 The weak portions including the through hole 46, the cutout 47, and the slit 48, respectively, are formed in the areas other than the area supported by the projection 24.
 With this configuration, the area of the mount tab 43A in which the weak portions are not provided is supported by the projection 24.  In comparison to a configuration in which an area supported by the projection 24 includes the weak portions,
the mount tab 43A is more reliably supported.  Therefore, the movement of the armrest 40 toward the outer side of the interior relative to the projection 24 in the side collision is not restricted and thus the deformation of the weak portions of the
armrest 40 is not restricted.
 The mount tab 43A is provided at one of the ends of the armrest 40 with respect to the front-rear direction of the vehicle, specifically, at the rear end closer to the rear of the vehicle.
 The armrest 40 is fitted in the board mount hole 21.  When the armrest 40 is pressed from the inner side of the interior, more stress is applied to the rear end than the center of the armrest with respect to the front-rear direction of the
vehicle.  In this embodiment, the rear end is supported when the armrest 40 is pressed.  Namely, the strength of the armrest 40 can be improved.
 The board 15 is in a substantially trapezoidal shape, or may be in a substantially rectangular shape.  In such a configuration, that is, the configuration in which the armrest 40 has a corner, the stress tends to concentrate on the corner when
the armrest 40 is pressed.  In this embodiment, the corner, more specifically, the mount tab 43A is supported by the projection 24.  Therefore, the strength of the armrest 40 against a load applied when the occupant uses the armrest 40 can be further
increased.
 The mount boss 22, the mount tab 43A, and the projection 24 are provided as a mount member, a mount base, and a support member, respectively.  The mount boss 22 projects from the trim board 20 toward the outer side of the interior of the
vehicle.  The mount tab 43A has the insertion hole 45 in which the mount boss 22 is inserted.  The projection 24 projects from the trim board 20 toward the outer side of the interior.
 The mount boss 22 and the mount tab 43 are fixed together only by inserting the mount boss 22 in the insertion hole 45.  The mount base, the mount member, and the support member are provided in relatively simple configurations.
 The lower edge of the armrest 40 has the notch 49 extending in the width direction of the vehicle and opening through the bottom.  The trim board 20 has the lower edge support member 25 formed in a shape so as to extend in the width direction of
the vehicle and fit in the notch 49.  The lower edge support member 25 is fitted in the notch 49.  The lower edge support member 25 supports the armrest 40 and guides the movement of the armrest toward the outer side of the interior.
 The area of the armrest 40 other than the area supported by the projection 24 (or the mount tab 43A) is supported by the lower edge support member 25.  With this configuration, the armrest 40 is more properly supported.  The lower edge support
member 25 is fitted in the notch 49 that extends in the width direction of the vehicle.  Because the lower edge support member 25 is fitted in the notch 49, the armrest 40 is guided toward the outer side of the interior by the lower edge support member
25.  In a side collision, the armrest 40 is more properly guided toward the outer side of the interior.  Therefore, the movement of the armrest 40 toward the outer side of the interior relative to the projection 24 and the lower edge support member 25 is
less likely to be restricted.
Second Embodiment
 The second embodiment will be explained with reference to FIG. 7.  The same parts as those in the first embodiment will be indicated by the same symbols and will not be explained.  A door trim 111 of this embodiment includes the projection 24 (a
support member) in a different location from that in the first embodiment and the mount tab 43 has different weak portions.
 As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 7, the projection 24 is arranged below one of the mount tabs 43 in the middle of the armrest 40 with respect to the front-rear direction of the vehicle.  The one of the mount tabs 43 is referred to as the mount tab
43B hereinafter.  When a downward force is applied to the armrest 40 from above, the mount tab 43B is supported by the projection 24.
 The mount tab 43B has a weak portion including a plurality of through holes 146.  The through holes 146 are formed close to a base of the mount tab 43B (or closer to the peripheral wall 42 than the insertion hole 45).  The through holes 146 are
arranged along the front-rear direction of the vehicle.  With the through hole 146, the armrest 40 is easily deformed in a side collision and thus the impact on the occupant can be reduced.
Third Embodiment
 The third embodiment will be explained with reference to FIG. 8.  The same parts as those in the above embodiments will be indicated by the same symbols and will not be explained.  A door trim 211 in this embodiment includes a mount tab having a
weak portion different from those in the second embodiment.
 As illustrated in FIG. 8, the mount tab 43B has a thin portion 246 (a weak portion).  The thin portion 246 has a smaller thickness than the thickness of portions around the thin portion 246.  The thin portion 246 extends from the edge of the
insertion hole 45 to a peripheral edge (or a distal end) of the mount tab 43B.  With the thin portion 246, the armrest 40 is easily deformed in a side collision and thus the impact on the occupant can be reduced.
 The thin portion 246 is formed at a portion different from the projection 24 with respect to the front-rear direction of the vehicle.  Namely, the thin portion 246 is formed in an area of the mount tab 43B other than an area of the mount tab 43B
supported by the projection 24.
Fourth Embodiment
 The fourth embodiment will be explained with reference to FIG. 9.  The same parts as those in the above embodiments will be indicated by the same symbols and will not be explained.  A door trim 311 in this embodiment includes a mount tab having
a weak portion different from those in the second and the third embodiments.
 As illustrated in FIG. 9, the mount tab 43B has a weak portion including a groove 346 with a depth measuring in a direction toward the inner side of the interior of the vehicle (toward the right in FIG. 9).  The groove 346 is formed in the mount
tab 43B close to the base end.  With the groove 346, the armrest 40 is easily deformed in a side collision and thus the impact on the occupant can be reduced.

 The invention relates to a drive device of a vehicle component, in particular of a body flap such as, for example, a tailgate.
 Electric tailgate drives, which comprise an electric drive motor and a planetary gear mechanism which is usually composed of a plurality of planetary stages for stepping down the drive speed, are known.  The planetary gear mechanism is mounted
axially upstream of the drive motor, which provides the advantage of a small diameter, with the result that only a relatively small installation space is necessary in the radial direction.  However, planetary gear mechanisms have a relatively large
number of components and require complex mounting.  It is also disadvantageous that the first planetary stage on which the armature shaft of the electric drive motor acts rotates at a high rotational speed, which causes noise to be undesirably generated.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The invention is based on the object of specifying a compact and low-noise drive device of a vehicle component using simple measures.
 The drive device according to the invention serves to drive a vehicle component, in particular a body component such as, for example, a tailgate, wherein the vehicle component can be adjusted between at least two positions--for example a closed
position and an open position--by means of the drive device.  The drive device can be activated electrically and comprises an electric drive motor and a transmission device for activating an output shaft, which adjusts the vehicle component, with the
result that the transmission device converts the drive movement of the motor into an actuating movement in order to activate the vehicle component.  For this purpose, the transmission device is coupled to the armature shaft of the electric drive motor,
wherein the drive movement of the armature shaft is converted via the transmission into a drive movement of the output shaft, which acts on the vehicle component.  Generally, the rotational speed is reduced from the armature shaft to the output shaft by
means of the transmission.
 According to the invention, the transmission device comprises at least one double transmission unit, composed of two transmission stages with two changes in direction.  The direction of the drive movement from the armature shaft to the output
shaft is deflection at two angles by means of the two transmission stages.
 This embodiment has various advantages.  Owing to the double deflection in the double transmission unit, it is possible to implement an embodiment which is relatively short in the axial direction, while maintaining the desired transmission down
step.  Despite the axially shortened embodiment, in the transverse direction and radial direction the embodiment is not larger, or is only slightly larger, than embodiments with multi-stage planetary gear mechanisms which are known from the prior art.
 Basically, the transmission which is used as the double transmission unit can be one which is low in noise, has only a small number of components and has, in particular, at least one worm stage, preferably a double worm stage, which is embodied
with two separate worm stages.  A double change of direction can be implemented in a particularly easy way by means of the worm stage transmission.  A double change of direction can be implemented in a particularly easy way by means of the worm stage
transmission.  At the same time, owing to the structurally simple embodiment with a relatively small number of moving components, low-noise operation is ensured.  Due to their design, such worm drives have advantages over spur gear mechanisms in terms of
the number of components and the generation of noise.
 The at least one worm stage of the double transmission unit has, according to a further advantageous embodiment, a multi-turn worm with at least two turns, wherein, if appropriate, embodiments with more turns such as, for example, three, four or
five turns, can also be considered.  Since the pitch angle also increases as the number of turns increases, the effectiveness of the worm stage is improved.  At the same time the breakaway torque, which is necessary to adjust the drive device manually,
decreases.  If the worm of the worm stage is provided with just one turn, self-locking occurs, which prevents manual activation.  In contrast, in the case of multi-turn worms, a breakaway torque which brings about an adjustment of the drive device is
applied manually.  The breakaway torque exceeds the securing torque, which keeps the current position when the drive motor is not activated, even though the breakaway torque in the case of multi-turn worms is of an order of magnitude which can be applied
manually.  This has the advantage that, for example in the event of a failure of the electric drive motor, the relevant vehicle component can be adjusted by manual activation, which is not readily possible in the case of a single-turn worm of the worm
stage owing to the self-locking.  The multi-turn nature of the worm in the worm stage therefore ensures that in emergencies it is possible to intervene manually.  It is therefore possible, for example in the case of installation of the drive device for a
tailgate in a vehicle, to open and close the tailgate in the event of failure of the drive motor.
 If both transmission stages of the double transmission unit are embodied as worm stages, the two worms of the worm stages are preferably each embodied in a multi-turn fashion with at least two turns, in order to avoid self-locking of the
transmission.  In this context, both embodiments in which the two worm stages have the same number of turns and embodiments with a different number of turns can be considered, provided that it is ensured that the two worm stages are embodied with at
least two turns.  As the number of turns increases, the efficiency of the worm stage is also improved, and accordingly the breakaway torque is reduced.  The overall efficiency of the double worm drive is determined by multiplication of the individual
efficiency levels of each worm stage.
 If further transmission units in the drive device are also embodied as worm stages, they are also to be equipped with a turn number of at least two in order to prevent self-locking.
 The change of direction in the double transmission unit with the two transmission stages can be implemented in various ways.  According to a preferred embodiment there is provision that a 90.degree.  angular deflection is carried out in each
transmission stage, with the result that the output shaft, on which the second transmission stage acts directly or indirectly and via which the actuating movement is transmitted to the vehicle component, is parallel with respect to the armature shaft of
the electric drive motor.  The dimensioning in the transmission stages is preferably selected in such a way that the output shaft is coaxial with respect to the armature shaft.  The coaxial arrangement is advantageously brought about by means of an
additional transmission stage which is arranged downstream and with which a further transmission down step can also be achieved.
 The parallel and/or axial orientation of the armature shaft and output shaft can basically also be achieved by virtue of the fact that overall a corresponding deflection is implemented in the two transmission stages of the double transmission
unit, wherein the deflection angle per transmission stage can also differ from 90.degree..  Angular deflections in an angular range greater than 0.degree.  and less than 90.degree.  per transmission stage are therefore possible, with an overall
deflection in which the input and the output of the double transmission unit are oriented in a parallel and, in particular, coaxial fashion with respect to one another being preferably set.
 The embodiment of the double transmission unit as a worm drive has the advantage of a simpler structural design over planetary gear mechanisms.  One shaft with, in each case, one worm which is arranged thereon so as to rotate therewith and a
worm gear are usually provided for each worm stage, wherein the worm of the shaft of the first stage meshes with the worm gear of the shaft of the second stage.  In the first stage, the shaft is driven on the input side by means of a worm gear, arranged
there, of a worm which is connected to the armature shaft so as to rotate therewith, and the second stage is expediently coupled to a downstream transmission stage by means of a pinion which is securely connected to the second shaft.
 According to a further advantageous embodiment, a spur gear stage is provided as a downstream transmission stage.  Depending on the requirements made of the transmission and the torque, an additional downstream planetary gear mechanism can be
provided with one or more planetary stages, wherein the planetary gear mechanism is driven by the output gear of the spur gear stage.  Depending on the requirements, it is also conceivable to implement the output via the spur gear stage.  Since the
armature rotational speed has already been stepped down by means of the upstream double transmission unit, the input rotational speed at the planetary gear mechanism is reduced, with the result that there is no undesirably high level of noise generation
at this point.
 The pinion on the shaft of the second transmission stage expediently meshes with a spur gear, which is connected to the sun gear of the planetary gear mechanism so as to rotate therewith, which spur gear interacts with planetary gears of the
planetary gear mechanism.  The downstream spur gear mechanism has the further advantage that a coaxial arrangement can be brought about between the central rotational axis of the planetary gear mechanism and the rotational axis of the armature shaft.
 On the output side, the planetary gear mechanism, in particular a planetary gear carrier which accommodates the planetary gears, is connected in a rotationally fixed fashion to the output shaft, which output shaft acts on the vehicle component
which is to be activated.
 According to one embodiment variant, the spur gear or output gear is connected to the planetary carrier, wherein the sun gear forms the output.
 The double transmission unit advantageously has in the radial direction, that is to say viewed transversely with respect to the armature shaft, a protruding portion which, compared to a cylindrical outer face of the downstream transmission
stage, is at maximum as large as the radius of the downstream transmission stage.  In particular in the embodiment of the double transmission unit as a worm drive, the radial protruding portion does not extend over the entire circumference but rather
only over a part or a segment thereof.  The protruding portion is, if appropriate, significantly smaller than the radius of the downstream transmission stage, wherein, according to one particularly advantageous embodiment there is provision that the
double transmission unit is completely within the cylindrical outer face of the downstream transmission stage.
 If appropriate, it is also possible to dispense with the downstream transmission stage.  Basically, an embodiment of the transmission device as a double transmission unit composed of two transmission stages with the direction being changed a
total of two times, is sufficient.
 If an additional transmission unit is arranged downstream, it can also be embodied as a worm drive in a further embodiment. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
 FIG. 1 shows a drive device of a tailgate illustrated in section in a vehicle.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 The drive device 1 illustrated in FIG. 1 comprises an electric drive motor 2, and also a double transmission unit 5 as a transmission device in a transmission casing 16, a spur gear stage with a pinion 15 and a spur gear or output gear 18, and a
downstream planetary gear mechanism 8 for driving an output shaft 9.  The armature shaft of the electric drive motor 2 is provided with a worm 4 which is secured so as to rotate with the latter and drives a first transmission stage 6 of the double
transmission unit 5, wherein the double transmission unit 5 has, in addition to the first transmission stage 6, a second transmission stage 7 which is located in the transmission path between the first transmission stage 6 and the planetary gear
mechanism 8.  The kinematic transmission path is therefore as follows: armature shaft 3 with worm 4--first transmission stage 6--second transmission stage 7--planetary gear mechanism 8--output shaft 9.
 The double transmission unit 5 is embodied as a worm drive, and the two transmission stages 6 and 7 are accordingly embodied as worm stages.  The first transmission stage 6 comprises a shaft 10 and a worm gear 11 which is connected to the shaft
10 so as to rotate therewith.  The first transmission stage 6 is also assigned the worm 4 on the armature shaft, wherein the worm 4 meshes with the worm gear 11.  The shaft 10 is oriented orthogonally with respect to the armature shaft 3.
 On the side facing away from the worm gear 11, the shaft 10 has a worm 12 which is arranged thereon so as to rotate therewith and which is part of the second transmission stage 7, which also comprises a shaft 13 and a worm gear 14 which is
arranged on the shaft 13 so as to rotate therewith.  The shaft 13 is arranged offset in parallel with the armature shaft 3 in the transmission casing 16 and is accommodated in a rotatably mounted fashion in a bearing 17.  The worm gear 14 meshes with the
worm 12 on the first shaft 10.
 The worms 4 and 12 of the two worm stages 6 and 7, respectively, are preferably of multi-turn design and each have at least two turns, wherein embodiments with three, four or five or more turns can also be considered.  The number of turns of the
worms 4, 12 can differ or else be the same.  The number of turns of at least two in each worm stage prevents self-locking of the transmission, with the result that in the event of failure of the drive motor a breakaway torque can be generated manually in
order to move the vehicle component into the desired position.
 On the side lying opposite the first transmission stage 6, the shaft 13 is coupled, via a pinion 15 arranged on the shaft 13 so as to rotate with it, to a spur gear 18 which is rotatably mounted in the transmission casing 16 and is driven by the
pinion 15.  The spur gear 18 represents an intermediate transmission stage which lies between the second transmission stage 7 of the double transmission unit 5 and the planetary gear mechanism 8 arranged downstream.  The spur gear 18 is arranged
coaxially with respect to the armature shaft 3.  A further reduction in rotational speed with associated increase in torque is provided via the spur gear 18.  The spur gear 18 is connected to a sun gear 19 of the planetary gear mechanism 8 so as to
rotate with it, by means of which planetary gear mechanism 8 a further reduction in rotational speed is achieved.  The sun gear 19 meshes with planetary gears 20 which are mounted on a planetary carrier 21 and are supported on the inner side of a ring
gear 22 of the planetary gear mechanism 8.  The planetary carrier 21 is connected to the output shaft 9 so as to rotate with it.
 The output shaft 9 runs coaxially with respect to the armature shaft 3.  The planetary gear mechanism 8 has a diameter d which exceeds the diameter of the drive motor 2.  The double worm drive 5 has a radial extent which is greater than the
diameter of the planetary gear mechanism 8; the radial protruding portion is characterized by a, wherein the protruding portion a only extends over a restricted angular segment.  The radial protruding portion a of the double worm drive 5 is at maximum as
large as half the diameter d of the planetary gear mechanism 8, but the protruding portion a is preferably no more than 1/4 the diameter d.

 The present disclosure relates generally to a cover or a tailgate rod passage in the tailgate assembly of an automotive vehicle.
 The advantages of providing a vehicle, such as a van or sport utility, with a tailgate for cargo access have been recognized for many years.  Moreover, these vehicles provide rear storage compartments which can be accessed to receive large items
via a lift-gate that opens substantially the entire rear of the vehicle.
 A lift-gate that swings upward about a horizontal axis to open can require significant lifting force to effect opening.  For the convenience of the person using a vehicle having a lift type tailgate, it may be desired that a power lift system be
provided to reduce the required lifting effort, particularly where the tailgate is a heavy singular gate or door that closes the entire rear access opening.  Similarly, it may be desirable to provide a fully automated lift type tailgate assembly.
 Various forms of power lift-gate systems have been proposed.  Typically, they include a motor conditioned to drive a rod which is connected to the tailgate.  More particularly, the lift type tailgate is connected to a motor provided in a vehicle
compartment with a connection rod, and opening/closing of the tailgate is assisted and/or automatically driven by the motor.  The motor can be located on an interior surface of a rear pillar and covered by a pillar garnish adapted to cover the surface of
the rear pillar.  The connection rod projects from the motor rearwardly via an opening formed in the pillar garnish and attaches to the tailgate so as to move generally diagonally upwardly and downwardly.  Typically, the connection is made between a
socket portion of the connection rod and a post secured to the tailgate.  In this manner, a rotatable connection is formed to allow a change in orientation throughout the opening-closing process.  In various commercial embodiments, the socket-to-post
connection may be exposed or may be formed under a garnish.  Traditionally, a rubber skirt may be provided to fill the opening in the garnish while allowing passage of the connection rod.
SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
 Various details of the present disclosure are hereinafter summarized to provide a basic understanding.  This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure, and is intended neither to identify certain elements of the disclosure, nor to
delineate the scope thereof.  Rather, the primary purpose of this summary is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form prior to the more detailed description that is presented hereinafter.
 According to one embodiment, a cover for a passage in a garnish through which a tailgate rod passes is disclosed.  The cover is comprised of a body having a perimeter shaped to cooperatively fill the passage.  The perimeter further defines a
cupped region including opposed side walls, a first inwardly inclined end wall having a slope, and a second inwardly inclined end wall having a slope greater than the first end wall.  An opening is provided in the body proximate a base region thereof.
 According to a further embodiment, a tailgate for an automotive vehicle is disclosed.  The tailgate is coupled by a rod to a motor within the automotive vehicle to open and close the tailgate.  The tailgate includes a metal frame having a point

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 One or more embodiments or implementations are hereinafter described in conjunction with the drawings, where like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout, and where the various features are not necessarily drawn to
scale.
 Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, the general design of a powered tailgate assembly of an automotive vehicle 10 is depicted.  To facilitate understanding of this disclosure, FIG. 1 includes a first closed tailgate 12 embodiment shown in solid line
and a second superimposed open tailgate 12 embodiment shown in dashed line.  The tailgate 12 is rotatable between a closed and an open position demonstrated by arcuate line ""C-O"".
 Tailgate 12 is comprised of a metal body surrounding a window opening 14.  A connection rod 16 is secured to an inner peripheral surface of the door frame 18.  More particularly, the connection rod 16 is secured to a post 20 mounted to the inner
peripheral surface of the door frame 18 via a ball socket 19 on the projecting end thereof.
 A motor 22 is secured to an interior surface of a rear pillar 24 and is concealed within a pillar garnish 26.  Projecting end refers to the region of the connection rod extending outside of garnish 26 The connection rod 16 is secured to an end
of a turn arm 28 which is driven by motor 22 so as to extend selectively and generally forward and backward (based on the vehicle orientation).
 The connection rod 16 is oriented such that when the motor 22 is driven, the turn arm 28 moves the connection rod 16 rearward and diagonally upwards (opening the tailgate 12) or forward and diagonally downwards (closing the tailgate 12).  A gas
damper 30 is further supplied to support the tailgate 12 in the open position.
 The drive assembly of the powered tailgate includes the rear pillar 24 which accommodates multiple components including, power tailgate motor 22, power tailgate rod 16, seat belt D-ring 34, electrical wire harness 36, a side curtain air bag 38
and a speaker 40.  Rear pillar garnish 26 is superimposed over the rear pillar 24.  The rear pillar garnish 26 attaches to the rear pillar 24 thereby providing a protective cover for the above mentioned components, including the power tailgate motor 22. 
The rear pillar garnish 26 includes a rectangular shaped opening 42 which receives a cover 44.  Cover 44 allows connection rod 16 (including the projecting portion terminating in ball socket 19) to pass through the rear pillar garnish 26.
 Ball socket 19 of connection rod 16 is secured to the post 20 on the door frame 18.  The inner peripheral surface of the door frame 18 is covered with a door garnish 32.  The door garnish 32 extends along the inner peripheral surface and covers
both at least a portion of the inner peripheral surface of the door frame 18 and the post 20.  Multiple cooperative garnish elements will typically be employed to cover the entirety of the door frame.  The door garnish 32 includes an opening suitable for
accommodating passage of connection rod 16 in a location corresponding to the post 20.  A cover member used to fill this opening is described in greater detail below with respect to FIGS. 3-6.
 Referring now to FIGS. 3-6, tailgate garnish 32 is attached to a surface of the door frame 18.  More particularly, the tailgate garnish 32 is attached to and conceals the inner peripheral surface 46 of the door frame 18, and overlaps a
connection post 20 secured to the door frame 18.  The tailgate garnish 32 provides a through hole 48 for receiving the connection rod 16.  The ball socket 19 is provided at a projecting end of the connection rod 16 and is fitted to the post 20 so as to
permit the joint to rotate upwardly and downwardly.  A cover 52 fills through hole 48 and receives connection rod 16 which passes therethrough.
 Cover 52 is generally comprised of an elongated body 54 having a rim 55 defining a cup shaped body 56 extending therefrom.  Cup shaped body 56 can be in the general shape of a truncated cone 58, formed by side walls 60 and 62 and inwardly
inclined end walls 64 and 66 and a base region 67.  The base region 67 can be formed as a separate wall that intersects side walls 60 and 62 and end walls 64 and 66 o may be formed at the point where side walls 60 and 62 and end walls 64 and 66
intersect.  Side walls 60 and 62 can be perpendicular to the plane of rim 55 and reside in generally parallel planes or may be slightly inwardly inclined.  To provide a sufficient range of motion for connection rod 16, inclined wall 64 is provided with a
relatively shallow slope as compared to inclined wall 66.  Moreover, angle .alpha.  is less than angle .beta..  In this manner, a relatively extensive range of inclination is available for connection rod 16 during its travel between tailgate closed and
tailgate open positions.  This is depicted by the phantom lines for connection rod 16 in FIG. 6.
 Truncated base 58 includes a passage 68.  Passage 68 can also extend into side wall 60 to facilitate passage of connection rod 16 and/or entry of connection post 20.  In this regard, it is contemplated that connection rod 16 may pass through
cover 52 to mate with the post on inner peripheral surface 46 of door frame 18 or that post 20 may penetrate cover 52 to allow mating with the ball socket 19 of connection rod 16 within the cup shaped body 56.
 A planar wall 70 extends from rim 55 to provide increased structural integrity to the cover 52.  A gap 72 extends in each of planar wall 70 and side wall 60 and intersects passage 68 to allow the cover to be installed over an installed
connection rod 16.
 The cover 52 is received in through hole 48 via an interference fit, but could also be retained via a mechanical joinder (such as clips or screws) or adhesively.  It can be formed, for example, a polymeric material selected from an olefinic
polymer such as polyethylene or polypropylene, an engineered resin such as polycarbonate or an elastomeric polymer such as styrene-butadiene copolymer.  In addition, it is noted that the disclosure contemplates forming the cover element as an integral
component of the tailgate garnish.
 In accordance with the present embodiment, the connection rod is connected to the door frame in the space provided by the cover so that the connection area is not overtly exposed to the vehicle compartment.  This provides improved aesthetics. 
The depicted cover provides an improved appearance to the passage for the tailgate rod in the tailgate garnish.  The design also minimizes the accessibility (visually and physically) to the internal mechanisms.  Nonetheless, the passage provided in the
cover also allows a full range of motion for the rod during tailgate stroke.
 The above examples are merely illustrative of several possible embodiments of various aspects of the present disclosure, wherein equivalent alterations and/or modifications will occur to others skilled in the art upon reading and understanding
this specification and the annexed drawings.  In particular regard to the various functions performed by the above described components (assemblies, devices, systems, and the like), the terms (including a reference to a ""means"") used to describe such
components are intended to correspond, unless otherwise indicated, to any component which performs the specified function of the described component (i.e., that is functionally equivalent), even though not structurally equivalent to the disclosed
structure which performs the function in the illustrated implementations of the disclosure.  In addition, although a particular feature of the disclosure may have been illustrated and/or described with respect to only one of several implementations, such
feature may be combined with one or more other features of the other implementations as may be desired and advantageous for any given or particular application.  Also, to the extent that the terms ""including"", ""includes"", ""having"", ""has"", ""with"", or
variants thereof are used in the detailed description and/or in the claims, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term ""comprising"".

 This invention relates generally to an apparatus for preventing wind noise.  More particularly, this invention relates to an apparatus for preventing wind noise on a vehicle door drain hole while still permitting the flow of liquid.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 It is well known in the art to provide a drain hole cover having a plug to prevent dust intrusion into a vehicle door.  Drain holes are common on vehicle doors and other vehicle body panels to permit drainage of liquids used during treatment
processes during assembly or to permit drainage of water during vehicle operation.  Numerous drain holes are provided on the vehicle door to encourage liquid drainage.  These drainage apertures are required to be large enough to facilitate quick liquid
drainage from the vehicle door.
 Typical apertures are in the dimension sizing of 7 mm by 14 mm (4 mm after size reduction), but vary depending on vehicle requirements and drainage requirements.  The large size of the aperture encourages dust and other particulate matter to
enter the aperture and rest within the vehicle door.  Dust preventers or covers as shown in FIG. 9 illustrating the prior art are well known and commonly used.  However, covers similar to those as shown in FIG. 9 of the prior art do not prevent or reduce
wind noise created when the vehicle is in operation.  Wind commonly flows over or around the aperture, which is still exposed in the prior art, and creates a loud noise which is heard by the user.  Accordingly, there exists a need in the art to provide a
cover or plug which permits the drainage of liquid while simultaneously preventing or reducing wind noise and dust from entering the drainage aperture.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention provides for a clip for a vehicle drain hole.  The vehicle drain hole is operable to allow liquid to escape from a cavity while simultaneously preventing wind noise or dust particulates from entering the hole.  The
apparatus includes a first surface and a second surface wherein the first surface includes a first aperture.  The apparatus further includes an attachment structure mounted to the second surface wherein the attachment structure is operable to connect to
the vehicle drain hole.  The attachment structure is spaced apart from the first aperture of the first surface thereby allowing the first surface and the second surface to fully cover the vehicle drain hole without blocking the vehicle drain hole thereby
allowing a liquid to escape the vehicle drain hole and preventing or reducing the wind entering the vehicle drain hole thereby preventing noise heard by the user. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 The figures illustrate a clip or plug operable to allow drainage of a liquid from a vehicle body panel while simultaneously preventing the entrance of wind or debris thereby creating noise or dust into a vehicle drain hole.  The clip includes a
first surface having an aperture spaced apart from a clip operable to connect to a vehicle drain hole.  The displacement and off set placement of the aperture and the vehicle drain hole reduces and nearly prevents the wind noise created from vehicle
operation from entering the vehicle drain hole.
 FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle door 10 having an inner surface 12 and a plurality of structural elements 14.  The vehicle door 10 further includes an upper end 16 and a lower end 18.  The lower end 18 includes a first lower surface 20 and a second
lower surface 25.  The lower surfaces 20, 25 include a plurality of drain holes 22 to permit liquid or water to escape from the vehicle door 10.
 A clip 30 is provided having a first surface 34.  The first surface 34 includes a first aperture 32.  The clip 30 includes a lower edge 42.  The aperture 32 is provided and connected to the lower edge 42.  The lower edge 42 and the aperture 32
are large enough to permit the escape of liquid from the vehicle drain hole 22.  The clip 30 further includes a second back surface 36.  The back surface 36 includes a clip 40.  The clip 40 is operable to connect to the vehicle drain hole 22.
 FIG. 2 illustrates a perspective view of the clip 30 in an installed position on the vehicle door 10.  Water or other liquid 50 flows out of the drain hole 22 through an inner cavity of the clip 30 and out the aperture 32 of the clip 30.  The
displacement of the drain hole 22 and attachment structure 24 from the aperture 32 permits the flow of liquid 50 out of the drain hole 22, into the inner cavity of the clip 30, and out of the aperture 32 of the clip.  The displacement of the aperture 32
and the vehicle drain hole 22 creates a labyrinth thereby greatly reducing or preventing air and dust from entering the drain hole 22.  Although wind or dust may enter the aperture 32 of the clip 30, wind or dust rarely reaches the drain hole 22.  The
aperture 32 and the drain hole 22 are separated by a predetermined distance.  The predetermined distance varies between 10 mm and 100 mm depending on the requirements of the vehicle and the user.
 FIG. 4 illustrates a cross-sectional view along the line 4-4 as shown in FIG. 3.  The clip 30 is shown having an upper outer surface 34.  The first surface 34 is generally planar.  The upper outer surface 34 extends to planar end portion 52, 54. The end portions 52, 54 are angled to meet end portions 56, 58 which connect to the vehicle surfaces 20, 25.  FIG. 4 illustrates a cavity 46 created by the clip 30.

FIG. 4, the attachment structure 24 includes a plurality of attachment structures 36a, 36b, 38.  The various attachment structures of the attachment structure 24 are generally snap fit bosses operable to securely connect to the aperture 22.  The
attachment structures 24, 36a, 36b, 38 include a plurality of snap fit portions 35 allowing the attachment structure 24 to better secure to the aperture 22.  These various attachment and support structures 24, 36a, 36b, 38, 64 are also shown in FIG. 8. 
FIG. 8 illustrates a rear side view of the clip 30 wherein the aperture 32 includes a side wall 70.  The rear side as shown in FIG. 8 of the clip 30 further includes a lower lip portion 62 operable to mount flush with a surface 20, 25 of the vehicle door
10.
 FIG. 6 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the clip 30 along line 6-6 as shown in FIG. 3.  This portion of the clip allows liquid 50 to flow through the cavity 36 from the drain hole 22 to the aperture 32.  FIG. 6 further illustrates a
secondary vehicle body panel 66.  FIG. 7 illustrates a cross-sectional view along the line 7-7 as shown in FIG. 3.  FIG. 7 illustrates a cross-sectional view of where the aperture 32 is located.  Water or other liquid 50 is allowed and permitted to flow
through the cavity 36 created by the clip 30 and out through the aperture 32.
 FIG. 7 illustrates side wall 70 as seen and created by the aperture 32 of the clip 30.  The clip 30 includes a first surface 34.  The outer surface 34 may be planar or contoured to match the shape of the various vehicle body panels or the
vehicle door 10.
 FIG. 9 illustrates a clip 100 of the prior art.  FIG. 9 illustrates an aperture 105 covered by the clip 100.  The clip 100 includes an upper surface 108 and various side walls 106.  The side walls 106 connect to one another by a rounded means as
illustrated by 110.  The clip 100 is mounted to the vehicle drain hole 105 by a snap fit plug.  The clip 100 is mounted to the plug and onto the first vehicle body panel surface 102.  The prior art as illustrated in FIG. 9 illustrates an exposed portion
104 of the vehicle drain hole 105.  As wind or dust is exposed to the exposed portion 104 of the vehicle drain hole 105, it is permitted to enter the vehicle drain hole 105 through the exposed portion 104.  As wind flows over, around and into the exposed
portion 104, a significant noise is heard by the vehicle user.  It is an advantage of the present invention as described above to prevent or reduce the wind noise as created in the prior art.
 The invention is not restricted to the illustrative examples and embodiments described above.  The embodiments are not intended as limitations on the scope of the invention.  Methods, apparatus, compositions, and the like described herein are

 This application is a National Stage application of PCT/EP2008/009500, filed Nov.  11, 2008, which claims the priority of German Patent Application No. 10 2007 054 656.6, filed Nov.  14, 2007.  The foregoing applications are incorporated by
reference herein in their entirety.
 The present invention relates to a motor vehicle comprising a component whose position may be changed and which is provided with a cable.  For this cable, the motor vehicle comprises a cable store with a force and/or torque storage means, of
which the stored force and/or stored torque changes with the position of the component.
 It is already known to provide vehicles, in particular motor vehicles, with movable, in particular pivotable, vehicle doors, electrical and/or electronic components and/or consumers, such as for example window lifters, door locks, illuminating
devices, acoustic devices such as loudspeakers or the like being arranged in or on the vehicle door.  Said electrical and/or electronic components and/or consumers are in this case, for example, connected by a round cable to the remaining electrical
components of the vehicle and/or the cable harness of the vehicle, in particular via or through a part of the vehicle chassis, in particular the A-pillar and/or the B-pillar.  The length of the cable in this connection has to be provided for the open
position of the vehicle door.
 The object of the present invention is to provide a motor vehicle with a cable guide which avoids an uncontrolled cable path, for example when the door is closed.
 The object is achieved by a motor vehicle comprising a component whose position may be changed and which is provided with a cable and which comprises a cable store with a force and/or torque storage means, of which the stored force and/or stored
torque changes with the position of the component.
 The present invention relates to a motor vehicle comprising a component whose position may be changed.  Said component may, for example, be a vehicle door, a vehicle tailgate, an engine hood but also a vehicle seat or a vehicle seat bench.  Said
component is provided with a cable in order, for example, to provide electrical or electronic consumers, for example window lifters, door locks, illuminating devices, acoustic devices such as loudspeakers, heaters, motorized drives or the like, which are
located in the respective component, with energy and/or signals.  The cable extends, moreover, into the vehicle chassis and/or is connected to a further cable which extends in the vehicle chassis.  The cable may be a flat or round cable, in particular a
ribbon cable.  The cable may comprise a plurality of separate electrical conductors.
 According to the invention, a cable store is provided which cooperates with the cable of the respective component and stores said cable as required.  Said cable store may be located in the component, i.e. for example in the vehicle door or
tailgate or in the vehicle seat.  However, it may also or additionally be arranged fixedly in the vehicle chassis, preferably directly adjacent to the respective component.
 Said cable store has a force and/or torque storage means, of which the stored force and/or stored torque changes with the position of the component.  The emptier the cable store is, preferably the greater the stored force and/or the stored
torque and vice versa.  Preferably, the force and/or torque storage means always has a certain pretensioning so that the cable never sags.
 Preferably, the cable store is provided in the component, for example in the vehicle door or in the vehicle seat.  Alternatively or additionally, however, the cable store may also be provided on the bodywork of the vehicle.  For example, the
cable store may be provided on or in the respective pillar or the respective upright to which the vehicle door or the tailgate is fastened.  The cable store may, however, also be mounted on the vehicle floor in the region of the respective seat.
 In the event that the component is a vehicle door or a vehicle tailgate, the stored force and/or or the stored torque of the force and/or torque storage means increases when the door is opened and reduces when the vehicle door is closed.
 Preferably, the cable store comprises two rollers, the rotational axes thereof being rotatable about a common center of rotation which is preferably located between, in particular centrally between, the rollers.  When rotated in one direction,
cable material is stored thereby, which is released again when rotated in the opposing direction.  Particularly preferably, the rotational axes of the rollers are arranged parallel to one another and preferably adjacent to one another.  Preferably, the
rollers are arranged on a common rotary plate.  The rotary plate is preferably connected to a spring, for example a torsion spring which is tensioned when the vehicle door is opened and thus releases the cable and is relaxed when the door is closed and
thus stores cable material.  The rollers in turn may additionally be mounted to be rotatable about their own axis.
 In a further preferred embodiment the cable is permanently, i.e. plastically, bent and elastically deformed when the position of the component changes.  Preferably, the cable or parts of the cable itself has or have sufficient material
properties for permanent deformation.  Alternatively or additionally, a permanently plastically deformable means, for example a resilient material is arranged, in particular bonded, on the cable.  The invention is explained hereinafter with
reference to FIGS. 1-4.  Said explanations are provided merely by way of example and do not restrict the general idea of the invention.
 FIG. 1a shows a first embodiment of a vehicle door, which is pivotably arranged on a pillar of the vehicle chassis, in the closed state.
 FIG. 1b shows the vehicle door according to FIG. 1a in the open state.
 FIG. 2a shows a second embodiment of a vehicle door which is pivotably arranged on a pillar of the vehicle chassis in the closed state.
 FIG. 2b shows the vehicle door according to FIG. 2a in the open state.
 FIGS. 3a, 3b and 3c show the embodiment according to FIG. 2.
 FIG. 4 shows the embodiment according to FIG. 1 when the vehicle door is closed.
 FIG. 1a shows a automobile door 2 which is arranged pivotably on a pillar 1, in this case the A-pillar or B-pillar, in the closed state.  This automobile door 2 has electrical-electronic components (not shown) which are provided via a cable, a
system cable 3, with energy and/or signals.  The cable 3 is, on the one hand, directly connected or indirectly connected to the pillar 1 and, on the other hand, to the control unit 5.  The cable store 4 is located between the control unit 5 and the
pillar 1, preferably in the door.  Said cable store consists in the present case of two, preferably rotatably mounted, rollers 6, 7 about which the cable is partially wound.  Said two rollers are rotatably mounted about a center of rotation which is
preferably located centrally between the two rollers, for example on a rotary table.  The rotational axes of the rollers are arranged parallel but not concentrically.
 FIG. 1b shows the automobile door according to FIG. 1a in the open state.  By opening the door, additional cable material is required.  As a result, the rollers 6, 7 rotate clockwise, and thus release the stored cable material.  The rotation of
the rollers 6, 7 clockwise takes place counter to a force storage means, for example a spring, in particular a torsion spring, which pretensions the rollers rotating counterclockwise, so that as soon as the door is closed again, the rollers rotate back
counterclockwise into the position shown in FIG. 1a, and thus again store the cable.
 In the FIGS. 2 a further embodiment of the cable store is shown.  In the present case, the cable 3 in the region 3' is permanently, i.e. plastically, bent, in particular in the shape of an omega.  When opening the door (FIG. 2b) said
omega-shaped bent portion is stretched by elastic deformation of the region 3' and thus the stored cable material is released.  As soon as the door is closed again (FIG. 2a) the cable in the region 3' regains its original shape.  Should the cable
material itself not have sufficient material properties for permanent bending, on the cable in the region 3' a bent means 8 (see FIGS. 3b and 3c), for example a spring means, in particular a leaf spring, may be arranged, which has the desired bending,
and which when opening the door is reversibly stretched.
 FIGS. 3a, 3b and 3c show once again the embodiment according to FIG. 2.  In FIG. 3a the upright 1 and the open door 2 and the cable 3 located between the door and the upright may be seen.  FIG. 3b shows the closed state of the door.  In this
view, the reinforcement of the cable 3 which is bent In the manner of a crooked stick may be seen, and which when opening the door (FIG. 3c) is reversibly stretched.
 FIG. 4 shows the embodiment according to FIG. 1 when the door is closed.

",,"TECHNICAL FIELD
 The present invention relates to a vehicle power supply apparatus protection structure, and more particularly relates to a power supply apparatus protection structure in which a power supply apparatus housed in a protection frame structure
formed by a plurality of frames is protected by releasing an external force to a vehicle body through the protection frame structure.
BACKGROUND ART
 In a vehicle, such as an electric vehicle and a hybrid vehicle, which is a type that travels using a motor, a structure is adopted in which a power supply apparatus serving as a drive source of the motor is mounted in a luggage compartment
having a sufficient crushable zone secured against an external force acting from the rear side (a rear-end collision).  With such a protection structure, the impact is absorbed by the crushable zone so that the load applied to the power supply apparatus
is reduced.  Also, a vehicle component is prevented from directly entering the power supply apparatus and damaging the power supply apparatus.
 However, in such a protection structure, in the case in which a power supply apparatus is mounted in a narrow luggage compartment space of a smaller hatchback type vehicle and the like, there is a case in which a sufficient crushable zone cannot
be secured against an external force due to a rear-end collision.
 As a conventional technique of the power supply apparatus protection structure, there has been proposed a technique in which a power supply apparatus (secondary battery) is housed in a protection frame structure (frame unit) formed by a
plurality of frames so as to enable an external force acting on the power supply apparatus to be suppressed (Patent Literature 1).
CITATION LIST
Patent Document
 Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2009-274665
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
Technical Problem
 However, the technique proposed in Patent Document 1 has the following problems, for example, in such a case of mounting a power supply apparatus which is extended in the height direction of the vehicle due to an increase in the capacity of the
secondary battery of the power supply apparatus.
 (1) The protection frame structure is fixed only at the lower end portion thereof, and hence, the position of the center of gravity of the protection frame structure becomes high.  Therefore, in the case in which only the lower end portion of
the protection frame structure is fixed to the floor panel by using a fixing member, it is not possible to obtain sufficient stability in the vehicle height direction of the protection frame structure.  Further, in the case in which the position of the
center of gravity of the protection frame structure becomes high, the upper side of the protection frame structure tends to be easily distorted due to the running of the vehicle.
 The insufficient stability in the vehicle height direction and the occurrence of distortion on the upper side of the protection frame structure can be avoided by increasing the stiffness of the protection frame structure itself and by firmly
fixing the lower end portion of the protection frame structure.  However, these measures result in an increase in the weight of the protection frame structure and the vehicle.
 (2) The protection frame structure is allowed to be moved by an external force acting on an outer peripheral portion of the vehicle from the rear side of the vehicle (for example, a collision (rear-end collision) with the other vehicle). 
Therefore, when the protection frame structure is pushed by an adjoining vehicle body structure component (for example, a back door) which is deformed simultaneously with the action of the external force, the protection frame structure may be overturned
toward the front side of the vehicle.
 An object of the present invention is to provide a power supply apparatus protection structure which, even in the case of power supply apparatuses that are stacked in the height direction of a vehicle and are mounted on the vehicle, can protect
the power supply apparatuses against an external force acting on the vehicle in a predetermined direction, and can suppress deformation of an adjoining vehicle body structure component.
Solution to Problem
 The present invention is to provide a power supply apparatus protection structure which includes a power supply apparatus mounted on a vehicle, and a protection frame structure formed by connecting a plurality of frames to each other and adapted
to house therein the power supply apparatus, the lower end portion of the protection frame structure being fixed to a floor panel, wherein the protection frame structure includes at least one frame extending along the vehicle width direction, and both of
the vehicle-width-direction end portions of the frame are connected to side-surface internal structures of the vehicle, the internal structures having a predetermined stiffness.
Advantageous Effects of Invention
 The power supply apparatus protection structure according to the present invention can, when a vehicle and a protection frame structure receive an external force, release the received external force to the vehicle body via a frame extending
along the vehicle width direction and connected to internal structures of the vehicle.
 Thereby, even in the case in which power supply apparatuses are mounted on the vehicle by being stacked in the height direction of the vehicle, the power supply apparatus protection structure according to the present invention can protect the
power supply apparatuses against an external force applied to the vehicle in a predetermined direction. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
 A power supply apparatus protection structure according to the present invention is configured to protect a power supply apparatus in such a manner that, when a vehicle and a protection frame structure receive an external force, the received
external force is released to a vehicle body via a frame which is extended along the vehicle width direction and connected to internal structures of the vehicle.
 In the following, an embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
 [Embodiment]
 In FIG. 6, reference numeral 1 denotes a vehicle, reference numeral 2 denotes a vehicle body, reference numeral 3 denotes a side body, reference numeral 4 denotes a roof, reference numeral 5 denotes a back door, reference numeral 6 denotes a
floor panel, reference numeral 7 denotes a vehicle compartment, and reference numeral 8 denotes a luggage compartment.  In the vehicle 1, a rear seat 9 is arranged on the floor panel 6 of the vehicle compartment 7, and a power supply apparatus 10 is
mounted on the floor panel 6 of the luggage compartment 8 between the rear seat 9 and the back door 5.  The power supply apparatus 10 consists of two secondary batteries 11 and 12 which generate a high voltage, and is stored in a protection frame
structure 13.  The lower end portion of the protection frame structure 13 is fixed on the floor panel 6.  Note that, in the protection frame structure 13, not only the secondary batteries 11 and 12, but also auxiliary devices (not shown) are stacked and
held in the vehicle height direction so as to be mounted in the luggage compartment 8 of the vehicle 1.
 As shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the protection frame structure 13 includes a first frame 14 and a second frame 15 arranged on the floor panel 6 of the luggage compartment 8 so as to be separated from each other in the vehicle longitudinal
direction (vehicle front-rear direction) and so as to extend in parallel with the vehicle width direction.  Both ends of a third frame 16 extending in the vehicle longitudinal direction are respectively connected to one vehicle-width-direction end of the
first frame 14 and one vehicle-width-direction end of the second frame 15.  Both ends of a fourth frame 17 extending in the vehicle longitudinal direction are respectively connected to the other vehicle-width-direction end of the first frame 14 and the
other vehicle-width-direction end of the second frame 15.  The vehicle-longitudinal-direction length of the third frame 16 and the fourth frame 17 is made equal to the vehicle-longitudinal-direction length of the secondary batteries 11 and 12.  A
reinforcing frame 18 is attached to the front side of the first frame 14.  A reinforcing frame 19 is attached to the rear side of the second frame 15.  On the inner side of the third frame 16, both ends of a reinforcing frame 20 arranged in parallel with
the third frame 16 are connected to the first frame 14 and the second frame 15, respectively.
 A rectangular shaped base frame of the protection frame structure 13 is formed by the first frame 14, the second frame 15, the third frame 16, and the fourth frame 17.  A fixing hole 21 is provided at each end of each of the first frame 14 and
the second frame 15 which form the base.  The protection frame structure 13 is fixed to the floor panel 6 by using fixtures, such as bolts, inserted into the fixing holes 21.
 Lower ends of a fifth frame 22 and a sixth frame 23, which extend upward, are respectively connected to the portions of the first frame 14, which are located in the vicinity of both vehicle-width-direction ends of the first frame 14.  The
separation distance between the fifth frame 22 and the sixth frame 23 is made equal to the vehicle-width-direction length of the secondary batteries 11 and 12.  At an intermediate position which is as high as the upper surface of the two stacked
secondary batteries 11 and 12, each of the fifth frame 22 and the sixth frame 23 is bent so as to be inclined toward the rear side.  At a height position which is lower than the intermediate position and which corresponds to the height of the upper
surface of the one secondary battery 11, the fifth frame 22 and the sixth frame 23 are connected to each other by a seventh frame 24 extending in the vehicle width direction.
 Lower ends of an eighth frame 25 and a ninth frame 26, which extend upward, are respectively connected to the portions of the second frame 15, which are located in the vicinity of both vehicle-width-direction ends of the second frame 15 so that
the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 are respectively paired with the fifth frame 22 and the sixth frame 23.  The separation distance between the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 is made equal to the vehicle-width-direction length of the
secondary batteries 11 and 12.  A tenth frame 27 extending in the vehicle width direction is connected to the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 at a height position which is lower than the intermediate position and which corresponds to the height of
the upper surface of the one secondary battery 11.
 Note that, as shown in FIG. 3, a reinforcing frame 28 extending in the vehicle width direction is attached to the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 at the rear side position thereof which is as high as the upper surface of the one secondary
battery 11, and a reinforcing frame 29 extending in the vehicle width direction is attached to the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 at the rear side intermediate position thereof which is as high as the upper surface of the two stacked secondary
batteries 11 and 12.  The two reinforcing frames 28 and 29 are connected to each other by an auxiliary frame 30 extending in the vehicle vertical direction.
 The fifth frame 22 and the eighth frame 25 arranged side by side in the vehicle longitudinal direction are connected to each other by an eleventh frame 31 extending in the vehicle longitudinal direction at a position as high as the upper surface
of the one secondary battery 11, and are connected to each other by a twelfth frame 32 extending in the vehicle longitudinal direction at the intermediate position as high as the upper surface of the two stacked secondary batteries 11 and 12.  The
uppermost ends of the fifth frame 22 and the eighth frame 25 are connected to each other by a thirteenth frame 33 extending in the vehicle longitudinal direction.  The length of the thirteenth frame 33 is shorter than the length of the eleventh and
twelfth frames 31 and 32.
 The sixth frame 23 and the ninth frame 26 arranged side by side in the vehicle longitudinal direction are connected to each other by an fourteenth frame 34 extending in the vehicle longitudinal direction at positions as high as the upper surface
of the one secondary battery 11, and are connected to each other by a fifteenth frame 35 extending in the vehicle longitudinal direction at the intermediate position as high as the upper surface of the two stacked secondary batteries 11 and 12.  The
uppermost ends of the sixth frame 23 and the ninth frame 26 are connected to each other by a sixteenth frame 36 extending in the vehicle longitudinal direction.  The length of the sixteenth frame 36 is shorter than the length of the fourteenth and
fifteenth frames 34 and 35.  Note that an auxiliary frame 37 extending in the vehicle longitudinal direction is attached to the sixth frame 23 and the ninth frame 26 at a position between the fifteenth frame 35 and the sixteenth frames 36.
 As shown in FIG. 1, in the protection frame structure 13, mounting holes 38 are provided in the first frame 14 at positions between the fifth frame 22 and the sixth frames 23, and are also provided in the second frame 15 at positions between the
eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26.  As shown in FIG. 2, the lower stage secondary battery 11 is housed in the protection frame structure 13 by attaching mounting portions 39 of the secondary battery 11 to the respective mounting holes 38 of the
first frame 14 and the second frame 15 by fittings, such as bolts.
 Further, in the protection frame structure 13, mounting holes 40 are provided in the seventh frame 24 at positions between the fifth frame 22 and the sixth frames 23, and are also provided in the tenth frame 27 at positions between the eighth
frame 25 and the ninth frame 26.  As shown in FIG. 2, the upper stage secondary battery 12 is housed on an upper portion of the lower stage secondary battery 11 in the protection frame structure 13 by attaching mounting portions 41 of the secondary
battery 12 to the respective mounting holes 40 of the seventh frame 24 and the tenth frame 27 by fittings, such as bolts.
 The protection frame structure 13 includes a seventeenth frame 42 as a frame extending along the vehicle width direction.  The seventeenth frame 42 is connected to the upper end of the rearward-inclined portion of each of the fifth frame 22 and
the sixth frame 23 so that both of the vehicle-width-direction end portions of the seventeenth frame 42 respectively reach the right side body 3 and the left side body (not shown).  The seventeenth frame 42 arranged at the front-side upper end portions
of the fifth frame 22 and the sixth frame 23 is bent at the connecting portions with the fifth frame 22 and the sixth frame 23 so that both of the vehicle-width-direction side portions of the seventeenth frame 42 extend to be directed toward the rear
side of the vehicle 1.
 Connecting portions 43 and 44 are provided at both of the vehicle-width-direction end portions of the seventeenth frame 42, respectively.  The connecting portions 43 and 44 respectively provided at the both end portions of the seventeenth frame
42 are respectively connected, by connecting members, such as bolts, to the right side body 3 and the left side body (not shown) which are side-surface internal structures of the vehicle 1 and which have a predetermined stiffness.
 Thereby, in the protection frame structure 13, both of the vehicle-width-direction end portions of the seventeenth frame 42 are respectively connected to the side body 3, as vehicle body structure components, which has the predetermined
stiffness.  Therefore, when the vehicle 1 and the protection frame structure 13 receive an external force from the rear side, the external force can be released from the side body 3 to the vehicle body 2 via the seventeenth frame 42 which is connected to
the vehicle 1 and which extends along the vehicle width direction.
 Further, in the protection frame structure 13, both of the vehicle-width-direction side portions of the seventeenth frame 42 has a structure in which the both side portions extend so as to be directed toward the predetermined direction of the
external force acting on the vehicle 1.  Thereby, the external force can be effectively transmitted to the vehicle body 2, so that local destruction of the protection frame structure 13 and the vehicle body 2 can be suppressed.
 As shown in FIG. 3, the protection frame structure 13 is provided with a partition wall 45 which mutually connects the rear end surfaces of the upper portions of the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 which are located on the rear end and
both of the vehicle-width-direction sides of the protection frame structure 13.  As shown in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5, the partition wall 45 is configured by a first member 46 elongated in the vehicle width direction and facing the rear side back door 5, and a
second member 47 elongated in the vehicle width direction and connected to the front side of the first member 46 by welding, or the like.  The first member 46 and the second member 47 are provided with a size that can cope with deformation of the back
door 5, and are bent in the width direction (vertical direction) with respect to the lengthwise direction thereof, so as to thereby improve the stiffness.
 Two mounting holes 48 are provided at each lengthwise-direction end of the second member 47, in the partition wall 45.  In the state in which the first member 46 is made to face the back door 5, the partition wall 45 is fixed to the rear end
surfaces of the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 by inserting fixtures, such as bolts, into the four mounting holes 48 of the second member 47.
 Thereby, in the protection frame structure 13, the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26, which are located on both of the vehicle-width-direction sides, are fixed to the partition wall 45 at three or more attachment points which do not exist
on one straight line.  The rear end surface of the partition wall 45 is provided with a size that can cope with deformation of the back door 5, as a vehicle body structure component, which is located on the rear side of and adjacent to the protection
frame structure 13.  Therefore, when the back door 5 is deformed by an external force applied from the rear side of the vehicle, the back door 5 is received by the rear end surface of the partition wall 45.  Thereby, the deformation of the back door 5
can be suppressed, and the local action of the external force on the protection frame structure 13 is prevented more than in the case in which the external force is merely received by a frame.  As a result, local deformation and destruction of the
protection frame structure 13 can be suppressed.
 The partition wall 45 is attached to the protection frame structure 13 at three or more attachment points which do not exist on one straight line, and thereby it is possible to provide the protection frame structure 13 which suppresses the
generation of distortion and which has an improved stiffness.  Further, the partition wall 45 is attached from the external force acting direction (the rear side), and hence the external force received by the partition wall 45 can be transmitted to the
eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 to which the partition wall 45 is attached.  As a result, the external force can be received by the protection frame structure 13 as a whole.
 As described above, among the frames of the protection frame structure 13, the seventeenth frame 42, provided on the front upper end portion of the protection frame structure 13 so as to extend in the vehicle width direction, has a structure in
which the both side portions thereof extend toward the vehicle rear side so as to be directed toward the direction of the external force (the rear side), and in which the both ends thereof are provided with the connecting portions 43 and 44 for
connection with the vehicle body 2.  On the other hand, the vehicle 1 is provided with the right side body 3 and the left side body (not shown), as internal structures, to which the connecting portions 43 and 44 are attached, and the connecting portions
43 and 44 are respectively connected to the right and left side bodies by connecting members, such as bolts.  Further, among the frames which form the protection frame structure 13 and which extend along the height direction, the eighth frame 25 and the
ninth frame 26 that are located on the rear side of the protection frame structure 13 are provided, at the rear end thereof, with the partition wall 45 which is attached from the rear side of the protection frame structure 13.  Note that the plurality of
frames, which form the protection frame structure 13, are connected to each other by fastening members, such as bolts, or by welding, and the inside of the protection frame structure 13 is hollow.
 The longitudinal-direction length of the upper end of the protection frame structure 13 is shorter than the longitudinal-direction length of the base portion on the lower side of the protection frame structure 13.  This is because, as shown in
FIG. 6, the protection frame structure 13 is installed close to the rear side of the rear seat 9, and because a seat back 49 of the rear seat 9 is configured to be inclined toward the rear and upper side of the vehicle.  Further, the
vehicle-longitudinal-direction length of the upper end of the protection frame structure 13 is set shorter than the vehicle-longitudinal-direction length of the secondary batteries 11 and 12 of the power supply apparatus 10 housed in the protection frame
structure 13.  For this reason, the present embodiment is configured such that, after the secondary batteries 11 and 12 are housed and attached in the protection frame structure 13, the partition wall 45 is attached to the protection frame structure 13. 
Thereby, the protection frame structure 13 can be installed on the vehicle front side as much as possible.
 More specifically, as shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, each of the fifth frame 22 and the sixth frame 23, which form the protection frame structure 13 and which extend in the vertical direction on the front side, has a structure in which the portion
ranging from the lower end to the intermediate position is extended in the vertical direction, and in which the portion ranging from the intermediate position to the upper end is inclined toward the rear side.  The intermediate position is set to a
position as high as the upper surface of the upper stage secondary battery 12 of the two vertically stacked secondary batteries 11 and 12.
 The partition wall 45 is attached to the rear side upper portion of the protection frame structure 13.  The partition wall 45 is attached to the protection frame structure 13 after the secondary batteries 11 and 12 are housed in the protection
frame structure 13.  Note that the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26, to which the partition wall 45 of the present embodiment is attached, is configured to linearly extend in the vertical direction.  However, the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame
26 may also be configured to have bent portions which allow the partition wall 45 to be placed in parallel with the components adjacent to the partition wall 45 in the state in which the protection frame structure 13 is mounted on the vehicle 1.
 The mounting holes 21 for fixing the protection frame structure 13 to the floor panel 6 of the vehicle body 2 are provided in the first frame 14 to the fourth frame 17 which form the lower end base of the protection frame structure 13.  On the
other hand, a plurality of structural members are attached to the floor panel 6 for obtaining the stiffness of the vehicle body 2 itself, and hence the floor panel 6 has a certain amount of stiffness.  The mounting holes 21 are provided at the four
corners of the base formed by the first frame 14 to the fourth frame 17, and the base is fixed to the floor panel 6 by inserting fixtures, such as bolts, into the mounting holes 21.
 As shown in FIG. 3 to FIG. 5, the seventeenth frame 42 extending in the width direction of the protection frame structure 13 is provided at the upper end portions of the fifth frame 22 and the sixth frame 23 provided on the front side of the
protection frame structure 13.  The connecting portions 43 and 44 for fixing the seventeenth frame 42 to the vehicle body 2 are provided at the both end portions of the seventeenth frame 42.  In the protection frame structure 13 mounted on the vehicle 1,
the distortion on the upper side of the protection frame structure 13 can be suppressed by respectively connecting the connecting portions 43 and 44 to the right side body 6 and the left side body.  Further, in the protection frame structure 13, the
external force received by the protection frame structure 13 can be transmitted to the vehicle body 2 through the connection structure of the seventeenth frame 42.  Thereby, local deformation and destruction of the vehicle body 2 can be prevented more
than in the structure in which only the lower end of the protection frame structure 13 is fixed to the floor panel 6.
 It is preferred that, as in the present embodiment, the seventeenth frame 42 connected to the side body 3 is attached to the front upper end portion of the protection frame structure 13.  The reason why the front end portion of the protection
frame structure 13 is preferred is that it is preferred to secure as long a distance as possible between the seventeenth frame 42 and the vehicle rear end at which the vehicle body 2 is highly possibly deformed by an external force due to a collision, or
the like, with the other vehicle.  The reason why the upper end portion of the protection frame structure 13 is preferred is that the effect of preventing distortion of the upper side of the protection frame structure 13, and the effect of preventing the
overturning of the protection frame structure 13 due to an adjoining vehicle body structure component deformed by the external force are high.
 Further, both of the width-direction sides of the seventeenth frame 42 are configured to extend so as to be directed toward the direction opposite to the predetermined direction of the external force which may act on the vehicle 1, specifically,
opposite to the direction of the external force which acts on the vehicle 1 by a vehicle rear-end collision, or the like, with the other vehicle.  When the vehicle 1 receives the external force, the seventeenth frame 42 acts to pull, in the same
direction as the direction of the external force, the right side body 3 and the left side body which are respectively connected to the both sides of the seventeenth frame 42, and thereby can effectively suppress the movement of the protection frame
structure 13 due to the external force.  If the seventeenth frame 42 is connected to the vehicle body 1 so as to extend simply in the width direction in a horizontal line shape, the possibility that the seventeenth frame 42 and the side body 3 are
locally deformed and destructed is higher than in the above-described structure (structure in which both of the width-direction sides of the seventeenth frame 42 extend toward the direction opposite to the direction of the external force acting on the
vehicle 1), and hence the structure of the present embodiment described above is excellent in this point.
 By using a right striker 50 (see FIG. 3) and a left striker (not shown), which are attached to the side of the vehicle body 2 of the vehicle 1 to fix the seat back 49 of the rear seat 9, the connecting portions 43 and 44 of the seventeenth frame
42 can be respectively connected to the right striker 50 and the left striker with connectors, such as bolts.  The right striker 50 and the left striker are respectively attached to internal structures provided on the side surfaces of the vehicle body 2
and extending in the longitudinal and vertical directions of the vehicle 1, that is, are respectively attached to so-called the right side body 3 and the left side body.  The mounting positions of the right striker 50 and the left striker, and the
portions around the mounting positions have a certain amount of stiffness by means of the other vehicle body structure components (not shown).  Note that the portions, to which the connecting portions 43 and 44 of the seventeenth frame 42 are attached,
are not limited to the strikers as shown in the present embodiment, and may be the other structure components of the side body 3, which also have a sufficient stiffness.
 The partition wall 45 extending in the extending direction of the vehicle-width-direction central portion of the seventeenth frame 42, that is, extending along the vehicle width direction is attached on the upper end rear side of the protection
frame structure 13.  The partition wall 45 can provide the following effects.
 A measure against the distortion of the protection frame structure 13 can be provided, and the stiffness of the protection frame structure 13 can be improved.
 The deformation of an adjoining vehicle body structure component (back door 5) due to an external force can be suppressed.
 The local deformation and destruction of the protection frame structure 13 can be suppressed by receiving, by the wide surface of the partition wall 45, an adjoining vehicle body structure component deformed by the external force.
 An adjoining vehicle body structure component can be received by the partition wall 45 and by the protection frame structure 13 irrespective of the direction of the external force received by the vehicle 1 from the rear side.
 The partition wall 45 is attached from the rear side of the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 to which the partition wall 45 is attached (the predetermined direction of external force which may be applied to the vehicle 1).  The direction
is the same as the direction of the external force which is received by the protection frame structure 13.  The partition wall 45 is attached to the protection frame structure 13 by fixing the four corners of the partition wall 45 by using fixtures, such
as bolts.  The partition wall 45 is formed by two members of the first member 46 and the second member 47, and the stiffness of the partition wall 45 is improved by joining the two members together by welding, or the like.  A part of the second member
47, which is a component of the partition wall 45, is formed to project beyond the rear surface of each of the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 to which the partition wall 45 is attached, toward the inside of the protection frame structure 13 to
such an extent that the projecting portion of the second member 47 is not brought into contact with the secondary batteries 11 and 12, and auxiliary devices which are installed in the protection frame structure 13.  This provides the partition wall 45
with a shape which can improve the stiffness of the partition wall 45 while preventing the protection frame structure 13 from projecting to the side of the vehicle body structure component (back door 5) located on the rear side of and adjacent to the
protection frame structure 13.
 As shown in FIG. 6, the protection frame structure 13 is installed in the luggage compartment 8 so as to be sandwiched between the rear seat 9 and the back door 5.  The lower end of the partition wall 45 is located at the same level as the lower
end of the back door 5.  Therefore, when the external force is applied to the back door 5, the entering of the back door 5 into the protection frame structure 13 is prevented by the partition wall 45, and by the eighth frame 25 and the ninth frame 26 to
which the partition wall 45 is attached.
 Industrial Applicability
 The present invention is to provide a structure in which, when a vehicle and a protection frame structure receive an external force, the received external force can be released to the vehicle body via a frame extending along the vehicle width
direction and connected to an internal structure of the vehicle.  Therefore, the present invention can be applied not only to the protection of a power supply apparatus, but also to the protection of a vehicle component mounted in the luggage
compartment.
