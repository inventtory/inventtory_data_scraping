DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
 Selected embodiments will now be explained with reference to the drawings.  It will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the following descriptions of the embodiments are provided for illustration only and not for
the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
 Referring initially to FIGS. 1 and 2, a vehicle 10 is illustrated in accordance with a first embodiment.  The vehicle 10 includes a vehicle body structure 12 that defines a pair of roof ditches 14 that are covered and concealed by corresponding
molding assemblies 16.  The molding assemblies 16 are described in greater detail below after a description of selected portions of the vehicle body structure 12 and the roof ditches 14.
 As shown in FIGS. 1-3 and 6-10, the vehicle body structure 12 includes, among other things, a roof panel 20, a pair of side panels 22, a pair of hinges 24, a vehicle door 26 and the molding assemblies 16.  The roof panel 20 and the side panels
22 are typically formed of one or more pieces of sheet metal or any other suitable material that is welded or rigidly and fixedly attached together to form a substantially rigid portion of the vehicle body structure 12.  Also the roof panel 20 and/or the
side panels 22 can be supported by other structural members as needed and/or desired.
 The roof panel 20 and the side panels 22 are dimensioned, contoured and shaped to define the pair of roof ditches 14 that are spaced apart along the roof panel 20 in a direction that is perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to a
longitudinal direction or lengthwise direction of the roof ditches 14.  As indicated, the side panels 22 are fixed to the roof panel 20 such that the side panels 22 and the roof panel 20 collectively define the overall shape of the roof ditches 14.  Each
roof ditch 20 is thus a joint that is made by union of the roof panel 20 and a respective one of the side panels 22 of the vehicle 10.  The roof ditches 14 are contoured and shaped to compliment the overall shape and design of the vehicle 10.  The
depicted contour and overall shape of the roof ditches 14 can vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Further the roof ditches 14 are depicted as extending between front and rear ends of the roof panel 20 and side panels 22.  Other orientations and directional
orientation are possible and are within the scope of the invention.
 The roof ditches 14, the hinges 24 and the molding assemblies 16 are identical to one another except that they are symmetrically shaped mirror images of one another.  Consequently, description of one roof ditch 14, one hinge 24 and one molding
assembly 16 applies to both.  Therefore, for the sake of brevity, only one of the roof ditches 14, only one of the hinges 24 and only one of the molding assemblies 16, are described below.
 As indicated in FIG. 5, the roof ditch 14 and the molding assembly 16 both include a compound arcuate and curved shape.  Specifically, as indicated in the side view in FIG. 3, the molding assembly 16 and the roof ditch 14 beneath the molding
assembly 16, have an arcuate shape when viewed from the side.  When viewed from above, as in FIGS. 1 and 5, the roof ditch 14 has a curved shape.  The overall curved and contoured shape of the molding assembly 16 is demonstrated in FIG. 4 and corresponds
to the shape of the roof ditch 14.  Specifically, FIG. 4 shows the molding assembly 16 removed from the roof ditch 14, but is shown with an overall shape that corresponds to the overall shape of the roof ditch 14.
 Also, as shown in FIGS. 5, 8, 9 and 10, the roof ditch 14 includes an inner wall surface 30 that is within a lateral boundary of the roof panel 20, an outer wall surface 32 that is positioned adjacent to the lateral boundary of the roof panel 20
and a recessed support surface 34 that extends laterally between the bottom edges of the inner and outer wall surfaces 30 and 32.  The inner wall surface 30 extends longitudinally along a first side of the recessed support surface 34 and the outer wall
surface 32 extends longitudinally along a second side of the recessed support surface 34.  The outer wall surface 32 is disposed outboard of the inner wall surface 30.  The inner wall surface 30 terminates at a top edge 30a that is defined along the
intersection of the inner wall surface 30 and the roof panel 20.  Similarly, the outer wall surface 32 terminates at top edge 32a that is defined along the intersection of the outer wall surface 32 and the adjacent one of the side panels 22.  The inner
wall surface 30, the outer wall surface 32 and the recessed support surface 34 therefore extend from the front section of the roof of the vehicle body structure 12 to the rear section of the roof of the vehicle body structure 12.
 As shown in FIG. 5, a rearward section 34a of the recessed support surface 34 has a depth that is greater than the remainder of the recessed support surface 34 to accommodate the hinge 24.  As is shown in FIG. 5, the roof ditch 14 includes a
plurality of fastening members 36.  Specifically, each of the fastening members 36 includes a head portion and a shaft portion.  As indicated in FIGS. 33 and 35, the shaft portion of each fastening members 36 is rigidly fixed to and extends through the
recessed support surface 34 of the roof ditch 14.  The head portion of each of the fastening members 36 extends above the recessed support surface 34.  However the head portion of each of the fastening members 36 is located below the top edges 30a and
32a of the inner and outer wall surfaces 30 and 32.  The head portion of the fastening members 36 is dimensioned and shaped to provide an attachment point for the molding assembly 16, as is described in greater detail below.
 A brief description of the hinges 24 is now provided with specific reference to FIGS. 6-10.  The hinge 24 at least partially extends into the roof ditch 14.  Further, the hinge 24 is mounted in the roof ditch 14 of the roof panel 20 and is at
least partially covered by sections of the molding assembly 30, as discussed in more detail below.  Basically, the hinge 24 includes a base component 38 and an arm component 40.  As shown in FIGS. 7, 9 and 10, the base component 38 of the hinge 24 is
rigidly fixed to the rearward section 34a of the recessed support surface 34 of the roof ditch 14 by fasteners.  As shown in FIG. 6, a rearward end of the base portion 38 is exposed at the pivot axis P. The arm component 40 pivots about the pivot axis P
such that the majority of the arm component 40 of the hinge 24 is located outside of the roof ditch 14, as shown in FIG. 7.  The arm component 40 is rigidly fixed to an upper end of the vehicle door 26 by fasteners (not shown).
 The pivot axes P of the hinges 24 are generally perpendicularly arranged with respect to a longitudinal direction of the vehicle body structure 12.  In other words, the vehicle door 26 is configured as a lift gate with the hinges 24 having the
horizontally arranged pivot axes P between the base component 38 and the arm component 40.
 Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the vehicle door 26 is configured as a rear door (i.e., a lift gate) of the vehicle 10.  In other words, the vehicle door 26 is configured as a lift gate with the hinges 24 having horizontally arranged pivot
axes P between the roof panel 20 and the vehicle door 26.  Typically, the pivot axes P extend in directions that are perpendicular or at least transverse to the longitudinal direction of the vehicle 10.  As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the hinges 24 are
situated at an upper-rear portion of the vehicle door 26 of the vehicle body structure 12.
 The vehicle door 26 that is typically formed of metal or any other suitable material and is pivotally mounted to the vehicle body structure 12 by the pair of hinges 24.  The hinges 24 are typically made of metal or any other suitable rigid
material having sufficient strength and durability to support the vehicle door 26 in the open position.  A more detailed description of the hinge 24 and vehicle door 26 can be found in U.S.  application Ser.  No. 13/042,990, filed Mar.  8, 2012 (Ref. No.
NT-US115071).  The disclosure of U.S.  application Ser.  No. 13/042,990 is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
 A description of the molding assembly 16 is now provided with initial reference to FIGS. 3, 4 and 5.  The molding assembly 16 can be made of plastic or any other suitable material that can have some flexibility.  In the depicted embodiment, the
molding assembly 16 is contoured and shaped to extend partially into and covers the roof ditch 14.
 As indicated in FIG. 3, the molding assembly 16 includes a front section 44, a mid-section 46 and a rear section 48.  The front section 44 and the rear section 48 cover the roof ditch 14 and further are contoured to extend flush with the roof
panel 20 (a vehicle body panel) between respective the top edges 30a and 32a of the first and second wall surfaces 30 and 32.  The mid-section 46 extends between the front and rear sections 44 and 48.  The mid-section 46 has a convex contour as viewed in
cross-section in FIGS. 30-35 and extends above the roof panel 20 (the vehicle body panel) between respective top edges 30a and 32a of the first and second wall surfaces 30 and 32 forming a roof rail protruding upward from and above the roof panel 20. 
Thus, the mid-section 46 has the appearance of a side roof rail, but does not include slots or gaps typically associated with roof rails or roof rack assemblies.
 As shown in FIG. 5, the molding assembly 16 includes a plurality of components.  Specifically, the molding assembly 16 basically includes a cover 50, an elongated molding member or molding member 52, a pair of elongated sealing members 54, a
plurality of cushions 56 and a pair of caps 58 that conceal a pair of cleats 60.
 A description of the cover 50 is now provided with specific reference to FIGS. 6, 7 and 10-15.  The cover 50 can be made of, for example, a plastic material, a polymer material, a metallic material or other materials suitable for use in an
exterior automotive application.  The cover 50 basically includes a top portion 64 and a close-out portion 66.  The top portion 64 is dimensioned and shaped to span a width of the roof ditch 14 between respective top edges 30a and 32a of the first and
second wall surfaces 30 and 32.  The top section 64 includes an upper surface 64a, a first lateral side 64b and a second lateral side 64c.
 The close-out portion 66 is angularly offset from the top portion 64, extending downward relative to the top portion 64 when installed to the vehicle 10 and the roof ditch 14.  Specifically, the close-out portion 66 extends from a peripheral end
edge of the top portion 64 towards the recessed support surface 34 of the roof ditch 14, as indicated in FIGS. 6 and 7.  The close-out portion 66 also defines a slot 66a through which the arm component 40 of the hinge 24 extends.  The close-out portion
66 extends laterally along a rear open section of the roof ditch 14 from the inner wall surface 30 to the outer wall surface 32, but within the roof ditch 14.
 As indicated in FIGS. 11 and 15, the cover 50 also includes a cover attachment section 68 and a molding attachment section 70.  The cover attachment section 68 is provided to couple the cover 50 at a fixed position relative to the vehicle body
structure 12.  Specifically, the cover attachment section 68 is configured to fix the cover 50 to the hinge 24, with the hinge 24 being fixedly secured to the roof ditch 14 by fasteners, as indicated in FIGS. 8, 9 and 10.
 The cover attachment section 68 is defined by a box-like structure that extends from an underside of the top portion 64 along a concealed side of the close-out portion 66, as shown in FIG. 15.  The cover attachment section 68 defines a fastener
slot 68a.  As shown in FIG. 17, a snap-fitting fastener 72 is installed in the fastener slot 68a.  As shown in FIG. 7, the snap-fitting fastener 72 is inserted thru an aperture 38a in the base component 38 of the hinge 24, thereby fixing the cover 50 in
position relative to the hinge 24 and the roof ditch 14.
 The molding attachment section 70 is defined along the top portion 64 of the cover 50, as shown in FIGS. 11-15.  More specifically, the molding attachment section 70 includes first and second slots 74 and 76 which, along with snap fitting
projections 78 and 80 of the molding member 52 (shown in FIGS. 16-18), define a lengthwise movement connection between the cover 50 and the molding member 52.  The first slot 74 and the second slot 76 are defined by the top portion 64 of the cover 50. 
The first and second slots 74 and 76 are both laterally and longitudinally offset with respect to the lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14.
 The first slot 74 and the second slot 76 both extend in the lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14.  As is further explained below, the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 are attachment members of the molding member 52 and are movably
installed, respectively, in the first and second slots 74 and 76.  As a result of the lengthwise movement connection between the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 of the molding member 52 and the first slot 74 and the second slot 76 of the cover 50, the
rear section 48 of the molding member 52 is movable relative to the cover 50 in the lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14.  The snap fitting projection 78 snap-fits into the first slot 74 of the cover 50 such that the molding member 50 cannot move in
lateral directions relative to the cover 50.  However, the snap fitting projection 78 can slide in a lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14 along the first slot 74.  Similarly, the snap fitting projection 80 snap-fits into the second slot 76 of the
cover 50 such that the molding member 50 cannot move in lateral directions relative to the cover 50.  However, the snap fitting projection 80 can slide in a lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14 along the second slot 76.
 The possible movement of the molding member 52 in the lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14 is provided because the molding assembly 16 is made of a completely different material than the roof panel 20 and the side panel 22.  Specifically,
the vehicle body structure 12 is preferably made of metal.  The molding assembly 16 can be made of plastic, polymers, rubber material or the like.  Consequently, the molding member 52 can undergo expansion and contraction in response to changes in
temperature that differs from the thermal expansion and contraction rates of the vehicle body structure 12.  Specifically, the overall length of the molding member 52 can increase and decrease as a result of thermal expansion and contraction relative to
the vehicle 10.  The first and second slots 74 and 76 are elongated such that the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 can undergo limited sliding movement along the length of the first and second slots 74 and 76 to accommodate the changes in overall
length of the molding member 52 as it undergoes thermal expansion and contraction.
 As is indicated in FIGS. 6 and 7, the cover 50 and the roof ditch 14 define a cavity.  The base component 38 of the hinge 24 is situated within this cavity and the arm component 40 (a vehicle door mounting structure) of the hinge 24 is situated
outside of the cavity.  More specifically, a rear end of the base component 38 of the hinge 24 is located adjacent to the slot 66a of the close-out portion 66 of the cover 50.  The arm component 40 of the hinge 24 extends through the slot 66a of the
close-out portion 66 of the cover 50.  Consequently, the majority of the arm component 40 of the hinge 24 is substantially located outside of the cavity defined by the cover 50 and the roof ditch 14.
 The cover 50 also includes a hook 82 that extends downward from the top portion 64 of the cover 50.  The hook 82 is configured to hook on to a forward edge of the base component 38 of the hinge 24 to further secure the cover 50 in place relative
to the roof ditch 14.
 A description of the molding member 52 is now provided with specific reference to FIGS. 21-35.  The molding member 52 is an elongated member that is formed unitarily as a single monolithic element.  The molding member 52 can be molded in a
single step, or can be molded in a series of steps to form the single monolithic element.  The molding member 52 can be made of a plastic material, a polymer material, a rubber or rubber-like material or any other material suitable for use as a molding
in an automotive application where such molding is exposed to the elements (sunshine, wind, cold, heat, rain, etc. .  . . ).
 The molding member 52 includes three basic sections, a front section 84, a mid-section 86 and a rear section 88.  The front section 84 corresponds to the front section 44 of the molding assembly 16, the mid-section 86 corresponds to the
mid-section 46 of the molding assembly and the rear section 88 corresponds to the rear section 48 of the molding assembly 16.  Specifically, the front section 84 and the rear section 88 cover the roof ditch 14 and further are contoured to extend flush
with the roof panel 20 between respective the top edges 30a and 32a of the first and second wall surfaces 30 and 32.  The mid-section 86 extends between the front and rear sections 84 and 88.  The mid-section 86 has a convex contour (as viewed in
cross-section in FIGS. 30-3) and extends above the roof panel 20 between respective top edges 30a and 32a of the first and second wall surfaces 30 and 32 forming a roof rail protruding upward from and above the roof panel 20.  Thus, the mid-section 86
has the appearance of a side roof rail, but does not include slots or gaps typically associated with roof rails or roof rack assemblies.  The front section 84, the mid-section 86 and the rear section 88 extend in a lengthwise direction relative to the
roof ditch 14.
 When viewed in cross-section as in FIGS. 30-35, the molding member 52 includes a top portion 90, a first lateral side 92, a second lateral side 94, a plurality of attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 and the above
described snap fitting projections 78 and 80.
 The top portion 90 has a contoured shape that has differing profiles along the lengthwise direction.  For example, as indicated in FIGS. 1-3, 5, 8 and 10 in the front section 84 and rear section 88 of the molding member 52, the top portion 90
appears to be flat, but can be contoured to include a slight curvature and arcuate profile corresponding to the curvature and arcuate contour of the roof panel 20 and adjacent side panel 22.  In the mid-section 86 of the molding member 52, the top
portion 90 is raised, such that the top portion 90 protrudes above the roof panel 20 and adjacent side panel 22.  Further, within the mid-section 86 of the molding member 52, the overall shape and cross-sectional profile of the top portion 90 changes
along the lengthwise direction, as indicated in the drawings.  The top portion 90 can be shaped and contoured in any of a variety of shapes depending upon the overall design of the vehicle body structure 12 of the vehicle 10.  The shape of the top
portion 90 in the depicted embodiment is for example only, and is not intended to limit the overall shape and appearance of the top portion 90.
 As shown in FIGS. 4, 5 and 21, the top portion 90 includes a pair of openings 112a and 112b.  The openings 112a and 112b are covered by the caps 58.  The caps 58 are removable to expose the cleats 60.  The cleats 60 are fixed to the recessed
support surface 34 by fasteners (not shown).  The cleats 60 are configured to support cross-members (not shown) that form part of an optional feature of a roof rack system.  These cross-members extend across the roof panel 20 between the two roof ditches
14 and are attached to the cleats 60 in a conventional manner.  It should be understood from the drawings and description herein that the openings 112a and 112b, the cleats 60 and the caps 58 are optional features that can be omitted.  Since these
features are optional, further description is omitted for the sake of brevity.
 The first lateral side 92 and second lateral side 94 extend downward from opposite lateral sides of the top portion 90 of the molding member 52.  The first lateral side 92 is positioned adjacent to the roof panel 20 and the second lateral side
94 is positioned adjacent to the side panel 22 with the molding member 52 installed to the roof ditch 14.  The first and second lateral sides 92 and 94 further include respective recesses or lips 92a and 94a that extend in a lengthwise direction along
the entire length of the molding member 52.  With the molding member 52 installed to the roof ditch 14, the lip 92a is positioned adjacent to the top edge 30a of the inner wall surface 30, and the lip 94a is positioned adjacent to the top edge 32a of the
outer wall surface 32, as indicated in FIGS. 31 and 33.  The first lateral side 92 includes a bottom edge 92b that is located below the lip 92a, as shown in FIG. 32.  As well, the second lateral side 94 includes a bottom edge 94b that is located below
the lip 92a, as shown in FIG. 32.
 The first lateral side 92 and second lateral side 94 also include a plurality of downwardly extending projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b, as shown in FIGS. 22-27.  The first lateral side 92 includes the
projections 120a, 122a, 124a, 126a and 128a, and the second lateral side 94 is provided with the projections 120b, 122b, 124b, 126b and 128b.  As indicated in FIGS. 21-25, the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b are
staggered along the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, but are paired together.  Specifically, the projections 120a and 120b are approximately aligned with one another relative to the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, as shown in
FIGS. 21, 22 and 23.  The projections 122a and 122b are approximately aligned with one another relative to the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 23.  The projections 124a and 124b are approximately aligned with one
another relative to the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 24.  The projections 126a and 126b are approximately aligned with one another relative to the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, as shown in FIGS.
21 and 25.  Further, the projections 128a and 128b are approximately aligned with one another relative to the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 25.
 The elongated sealing members 54 are installed along respective ones of the lips 92a and 94a, as indicated in FIGS. 8, 33 and 35.  The elongated sealing members 54 provide a cushion between the roof ditch 14 and the molding member 52.  The
elongated sealing members 54 extend the length of the molding member 52.  The elongated sealing members 54 include slots that receive the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b.  More specifically, the projections 120a,
120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b extend downward through the slots formed in the sealing members 54.
 The projections 120a through 128b are stabilizing projections that position the molding member 52 in a relatively fixed orientation within the roof ditch 14.  The projections 120a, 122a, 124a, 126a and 128a extend below the lip 92a and the
bottom edge 92b of the first lateral side 92.  Similarly, the projections 120b, 122b, 124b, 126b and 128b extend below the lip 94a and the bottom edge 94b of the second lateral side 94.  The projections 120a through 128b are further tapered in thickness,
as indicated in FIGS. 30 and 31.  More specifically, the projections 120a through 128b have tapering thicknesses such that upper ends of the stabilizing projections 120a through 128b are thicker than lower end of the stabilizing projections, as shown in
FIGS. 30 and 31.  Further, with the molding member 52 installed in the roof ditch 14, the projections 120a, 122a, 124a, 126a and 128a of the first lateral side 92 conform to shape of the inner side wall 30.
 Similarly, the projections 120b, 122b, 124b, 126b and 128b of the second lateral side 94 conform to the shape of the outer side wall 32 with the molding member 52 installed to the roof ditch 14.  In other words, the projections 120a, 122a, 124a,
126a and 128a of the first lateral side 30 extend downward away from the top portion 90 along the first wall surface 30 of the roof ditch 14 and the projections 120b, 122b, 124b, 126b and 128b of the second lateral side 94 extend downward away from the
top portion 90 along the second wall surface 32 of the roof ditch 14.  Further, the projections 120a through 128b all extend downward below respective bottom edges 92b and 94b of the first and second lateral sides 92 and 94 into contact with the recessed
support surface 34 of the roof ditch 14.
 Further, each of the projections 120a through 128b is provided a corresponding one of the cushions 56.  The cushions 56 are included to reduce and/or prevent noise that might otherwise occur during movement of the molding member 52 relative to
the roof ditch 14.  More specifically, as the molding member 52 experiences thermal expansion and contraction, the cushions 56 provide a reduced friction surface that permits small amounts of movement of the molding member 52 relative to the surfaces of
the roof ditch 14.
 A description is now provided of the plurality of attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110.  The attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 all have structural features in common with one another but due
to variations in the overall shape of the molding member 52 along its length, each of the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 can have slightly different overall dimensions.  However, the general description below of the
attachment structure 102 applies to each of the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110.
 As indicated in FIGS. 29, 32 and 33, each of the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 includes a first side wall 132, a second side wall 134, a lateral wall 136 extending between the first and second side walls 132 and
134 and a bottom wall 138.  An upper end of the first side wall 132 is fixed to and formed integrally (molded) with the first lateral side 92 of the molding member 52.  Further, an tipper end of the second side wall 134 is fixed to and formed integrally
(molded) with the second lateral side 94 of the molding member 52.  The first side wall 132 extends downward from an upper area of the first lateral side 92 and the second side wall 134 extends downward from a mid-section of the second lateral side 94. 
Further, the side wall 136 extends between the first and second side walls 132 and 134, being integrally formed or molded therewith.  However, as the first side wall 132 extends downward, a lower section of the first side wall 132 is spaced apart from
the first lateral side 92 and the second lateral side 94.  As well, as the second side wall 134 extends downward, the lower section of the second side wall 134 is spaced apart from the second lateral side 94.
 The first side wall 132 and the lateral wall 136 are perpendicularly arranged relative to one another.  The lateral wall 136 and the second side wall 134 are also arranged perpendicularly relative to one another, with the first and second side
walls 132 and 134 facing one another.  The first side wall 132, the second side wall 134 and the lateral wall 136 define an open area between the first and second side walls 132 and 134 and above the bottom wall 138.
 The bottom wall 138 extends in a direction that is approximately perpendicular to each of the first, second and third side walls 132, 134 and 136.  Further, the bottom wall is formed integrally (molded) with the first and second side walls 132,
134 and the lateral wall 136.  The bottom wall 138 includes a slot or opening 140.  The bottom wall 138 defines a lower or bottom surface that includes a pair of ribs 142.  The ribs 142 extend in a lengthwise direction relative to the roof ditch 14.  The
ribs 142 are located on opposite lateral sides of the opening 140.  The lower surface of the bottom wall 138 of each of the attachment structures are positioned vertically lower than adjacent sections of the longitudinally extending lips 92a and 94a.
 A clip 144 (clip member) is snap fitted into the opening 140, as shown in FIGS. 33 and 35, for each of the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110, but not the attachment structure 96, as is explained below.  The clip 144
defines an elongated slot that snap fits to a corresponding one of the fastening members 36.  Hence, there is a plurality of the clips 144, one for each of the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110.  The clips 144 all include mounting
parts that snap fit to the bottom wall 138 at the opening 140.
 It should be understood from the drawings and description herein, that the fastening members 36 shown in FIG. 5, are spaced apart from one another in alignment with the spacing between the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and
110.  With the clips 144 installed to the openings 140 of each of the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110, the molding member 52 is installed to the roof ditch 14 by pressing down on the molding member 52, snap fitting each of the
fastening members 36, one by one, into the clips 144 of each of the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110.  The elongated slot of each of the clips 144 receives one the fastening members 36 extending therethrough.  The elongated slots
of the clips 144 extend in a direction approximately parallel to a lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14 and are dimensioned relative to the fastening members 36 such that the molding member can undergo limited movement relative to the roof ditch. 
Consequently, it is possible for there to be small amounts of relative movement between the fastening members 36 and the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 in the lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14.  More specifically, the
clips 144 are configured to allow for thermal expansion and contraction of the molding member relative to the roof ditch 14.
 As is indicated in FIG. 21, the attachment structure 96 is provided with a clip 146 that has a rounded opening.  Consequently, once the molding member 52 is installed to the roof ditch 14, the front section 84 is fixed in position relative to
the roof ditch 14 via the connection between the fastening member 36 and the clip 146 in the attachment structure 96.
 As is indicated in FIGS. 21-27, the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b (the stabilizing projections) of the first and second lateral sides 92 and 94 are offset from the attachment structures 96, 98, 100,
102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 (roof attachment portions) as viewed laterally with respect to a lengthwise direction along the roof ditch 14.  More specifically, the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b (the stabilizing
projections) are longitudinally spaced apart from adjacent ones of the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 (roof attachment portions).  For example, as shown in FIG. 23, the projections 120a and 120b are spaced apart from the
attachment structure 98.  Specifically, the projections 120a and 120b are positioned closer to the front of the vehicle 10 than the attachment structure 98.  The projections 122a and 122b are also spaced apart from and are located rearward from the
attachment structure 98.  Further as shown in FIG. 24, the projections 124a and 124b are located between the attachment structures 102 and 104, being offset therefrom.  As shown in FIG. 25, the projections 126a and 126b are located between the attachment
structures 106 and 108, being offset therefrom.
 As is indicated in FIGS. 27, 30 and 31, the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b (the stabilizing projections) extend downward from the first and second lateral sides 92 and 94 lower than a lowermost surface
of the bottom wall 138 of each of the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 (the roof attachment portions).  Further, the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b extend downward from the first and
second lateral sides 92 and 94 lower than the ribs 142, as indicated in FIGS. 30 and 31.
 However, when the molding member 52 is installed within the roof ditch 14, the ribs 142 can contact and remain in contact with the recessed support surface 34 with the molding member 52 installed to the roof ditch 14.  Alternatively, the ribs
142 can be dimensioned to remain slightly spaced apart from the recessed support surface 34 with the molding member 52 installed to the roof ditch 14.
 In the depicted embodiment, the molding member 52 (the top portion, the first lateral side 92 and the second lateral side 94), the snap fitting projections 78 and 80, and the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 are
formed unitarily as a single monolithic element.
 During assembly, the cover 50 is first attached to the hinge 24.  The clips 144 and the clip 146 are installed to the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110, and the attachment structure 96, respectively.  The seals 54 are
installed to the lips 92a and 94a of the molding member 52.  Thereafter, the molding member 52 is installed to the roof ditch 14 such that the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 are inserted into the first and second slots 74 and 76 of the cover 50; and
the fastening members 36 are snap fitted into the slots or openings of the clips 144 (and 146) installed to the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 of the molding member 52.  During installation, the projections 120a, 122a,
124a, 126a and 128a of the first lateral side 92 of the molding member 52 press against and conform to the shape of the inner wall surface 30 of the roof ditch 14, then contact the recessed support surface 34 of the roof ditch 14.  Similarly, the
projections 120b, 122b, 124b, 126b, and 128b of the second lateral side 94 of the molding member 52 press against and conform to the shape of the outer wall surface 32 of the roof ditch 14, then contact the recessed support surface 34 of the roof ditch
14.
 The attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 snap fitted to the fastening members 36 fixes the molding assembly 16 to the roof ditch 14.  Further, contact between the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a,
126b, 128a and 128b of the molding member 52 and the inner wall surface 30, the outer wall surface 32 and the recessed support surface 34 ensure a firm, non-twistable and non-rotatable installation of the molding member 52 to the roof ditch 14.
Second Embodiment
 Referring now to FIGS. 36 and 37, a molding assembly in accordance with a second embodiment will now be explained.  In view of the similarity between the first and second embodiments, the parts of the second embodiment that are identical to the
parts of the first embodiment will be given the same reference numerals as the parts of the first embodiment.  Moreover, the descriptions of the parts of the second embodiment that are identical to the parts of the first embodiment may be omitted for the
sake of brevity.  The parts of the second embodiment that differ from the parts of the first embodiment will be indicated with a single prime (').
 In the second embodiment, the molding assembly is very similar to the first embodiment in that it includes the cover 50, but includes a modified molding member 52'.  In the second embodiment the molding member 52 of the first embodiment has been
replaced with the molding member 52'.  The molding member 52' includes each and every feature of the molding member 52 of the first embodiment, as described above.  However, in the second embodiment, the molding member 52' includes an additional feature. Specifically, the molding member 52' includes an attachment projection 200 that extends laterally inwardly from adjacent the bottom edge 94b of the second lateral side 94 of the molding member 52'.  Further, the attachment projection 200 has an upper
surface (not visible) that extends approximately parallel to an underside surface 88a of the molding member 52'.  The attachment projection 200 is a snap fitting projection in the second embodiment, as described further below.
 As described in the first embodiment (and included in the second embodiment), the molding member 52' also includes the snap fitting projections 78 and 80.  The snap fitting projections 78 and 80 extend away from the underside surface 88a of the
molding member 52.  The snap-fitting projection 200 extends in a direction that is perpendicular to the snap fitting projections 78 and 80.  The attachment projection 200 further extends in a direction that is perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of
the molding member 52'.  The attachment projection 200 is spaced apart from the underside surface 88a of the molding member 52' by a distance that allows the second lateral side 64c to be disposed between the underside surface 88a of the molding member
52 and the attachment projection 200.  Preferably, the attachment projection 200 is positioned to retain the upper surface 64a of the top portion 64 of the cover 50 flush to the underside surface 88a of the molding member 52'.
 As is shown in FIG. 37, the attachment projection 200 (the attachment projection) extends under the second lateral side 64c of the cover 50 in the installed position (FIG. 37 is an upside-down view of the cover 50 and the molding member 52'). 
However, it should be understood that the attachment projection 200 can be located on either lateral side of the molding member 52' such that either one of the first lateral side 64b and the second lateral side 64c of the cover 50 can be retained by the
snap fitting projection 200.  Further, multiple ones of the snap fitting projections 200 can be included on the molding member 52'.  It should be understood from the drawings and the description herein that the lengthwise movement connection defined by
the connection between the first and second slots 74 and 76, and the snap fitting projections 78 and 80, is enhanced and supported by the attachment projection 200.  Specifically, the attachment projection 200 is positioned to allow the lengthwise
movement of the molding member 52' relative to the cover 50.
 As shown in FIG. 37, the first and second slots 74 and 76 are both laterally and longitudinally offset from one another.  Similarly, the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 are likewise laterally and longitudinally offset from one another.  In
the depicted embodiment, the snap fitting projection 78 and the attachment projection 200 are both located at the second lateral side 94 of the molding member 52'.  However, the snap fitting projection 78 and the attachment projection 200 are spaced
apart from one another in the longitudinal direction of the molding member 52'.  The snap fitting projection 80 and the attachment projection 200 are spaced apart from one another in the lateral direction of the molding member 52'.  As well, the
attachment projection 200 is laterally aligned with portions of the second slot 76 and the snap fitting projection 80.
 In the second embodiment, the molding member 52' and the attachment projection 80 can be made of any of a variety of materials.  For example, the molding member 52' can be made of a plastic or polymer material that has sufficient resiliency and
flexibility such that the attachment projection 200 can snap fit to the cover 50 during assembly of the cover 50 to the molding member 52'.  However, if the molding member 52' is made of a more rigid material, such as stainless steel or chrome plated
metal material, then the dimensions of the attachment projection 200 may need to be modified in order for the attachment projection 200 to snap fit to the cover 50.  Still further, it is also possible to modify the cover 50 with a recess that permits
installation of the molding member 52' to the cover 50, without utilizing a snap fit engagement between the attachment projection 200 and the cover 50, as is described in greater detail below with respect to a third embodiment.
Third Embodiment
 Referring now to FIGS. 38 and 39, a molding assembly in accordance with a third embodiment will now be explained.  In view of the similarity between the first, second and third embodiments, the parts of the third embodiment that are identical to
the parts of the first and second embodiments will be given the same reference numerals as the parts of the first and second embodiments.  Moreover, the descriptions of the parts of the third embodiment that are identical to the parts of the first and
second embodiments may be omitted for the sake of brevity.
 In the third embodiment, the molding assembly includes the molding member 52' and therefore includes all of the features of the molding member 52 described with respect to the first embodiment and further includes the attachment projection 200
of the molding member 52' described with respect to the second embodiment.
 In the third embodiment, the molding assembly further includes a cover 50' that includes all of the features of the cover 50 described above with respect to the first and second embodiments, and further includes a recess 210.  The recess 210 is
formed along the second lateral side 64c of the top section 64 of the cover 50'.  The recess 210 is basically a cutout that is dimensioned such that the attachment projection 200 can pass through the recess 210 when the attachment projection 200 is
aligned with the recess 210.  Specifically, as shown in FIG. 38 the recess 210 is an insertion slot.  As described above with respect to the cover 50, the cover 50' of the third embodiment can undergo limited sliding movement with the snap fitting
projections 78 and 80 installed within the first and second slots 74 and 76.  During installation and/or removal of the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 in and out of the first and second slots 74 and 76, there may be difficulty moving the cover 50'
past the attachment projection 200.  For example, if one or both of the molding member 52' and the cover 50' are made of a rigid material, assembly of the molding member 52' to the cover 50' may make snap fitting engagement between the attachment
projection 200 and the cover 50' difficult.  The recess 210 allows for added ease of assembly and dis-assembly.  Specifically, with the cover 50' installed to the roof ditch 14 as described above and the molding member 52' in an installation orientation
with respect to the cover 50', the attachment projection 200 is aligned with the recess 210 (insertion slot).  As the molding member moves from an installation orientation to an installed orientation, the snap-fitting projections 78 and 80 of the molding
member 52' pass through respective first slot 74 and second slot 76 of the cover 50' while the attachment projection 200 passes through the recess 210 (insertion slot).
 As shown in FIG. 39, once the molding member 52' is slid into a fully installed position or fully attached position relative to the cover 50', the attachment projection 200 no longer aligns with the recess 210 and retains the upper surface 64a
of the top portion 64 of the cover 50' flush to the underside surface 88a of the molding member 52'.
 The various features of the vehicle 10, other than the above described roof ditch 14 and the molding assembly 16, are conventional components that are well known in the art.  Since these various features of the vehicle 10 are well known in the
art, these structures will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein.  Rather, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the components can be any type of structure and/or programming that can be used to carry out
the present invention.

 The front end, thus provided with its equipment items, constitutes a unitary module that can be prepared and delivered by an equipment manufacturer and ready to be mounted on a motor vehicle during installation by the constructor.  The front end
is mounted by connection to the components of the chassis of the vehicle, such as the stringers, then a front bumper or fender is put in place, added to the module.
 A front end generally comprises a support part for one or more radiators or cooling modules, for the front headlights, and a bumper beam which helps to protect the module equipment items in the event of a front impact.  These components are
fastened together rigidly in order to maintain the geometry and the cohesion of the assembly.  In order to better meet the technical manufacturing and economical constraints, it is known practice to segment the support part into different parts fastened
together rigidly.  It is thus known practice to have support parts comprising a bottom crossmember with side uprights, a top crossmember fastened between or at the top of the side uprights and headlight supports fastened to the ends of the top
crossmember and/or onto the side uprights.
 In an impact, its different parts can be subjected to torsion and shear stresses that can cause its parts to break and/or fastenings to break.  The breaking of the support part can thus force the motor vehicle to be immobilized because of the
possible damage to the supported components, notably linked to the cooling module, and this de facto increases the repair costs.
 One of the aims of the invention is therefore to at least partially remedy the drawbacks of the prior art and to propose a front-end module for a motor vehicle likely to limit the breaking of the support part in the event of an impact.
 The present invention therefore relates to a front-end module for a motor vehicle comprising a support part, said support part comprising two headlight supports each fastened onto a distinct side of the support part, said headlight support
including a means for fastening to a fastening area of the support part forming a fastening axis around which said headlight support can pivot relative to the support part in the event of an impact.
 According to one aspect of the invention, each of the fastening areas includes a fastening plate at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the support part, said fastening plate including an oblong notch whose opening is directed toward the
front of the vehicle and that each headlight support is fastened to said fastening plate.
 According to another aspect of the invention, each headlight support includes a revolution component situated on the fastening axis and that each of the fastening areas includes a recess complementing said revolution component and open toward
the front of the vehicle, in which said revolution component is housed and which closely follows the form of said revolution component.
 According to another aspect of the invention, the revolution component is a cylindrical component whose axis of symmetry is merged with the fastening axis.
 According to another aspect of the invention, the revolution component is a truncated cylindrical component including at least one planar facet, said at least one planar facet being situated on the portion of the truncated cylindrical component
that fits into the complementary recess.
 According to another aspect of the invention, the revolution component includes a positioning pin at right angles to the fastening axis and that the complementary recess includes a positioning orifice, said pin being inserted into said
positioning orifice.
 According to another aspect of the invention, the positioning pin is part of the same material as the revolution component.
 According to another aspect of the invention, the positioning pin is an independent part fastened to the revolution component.
 According to another aspect of the invention, the fastening areas are situated at the ends of a top crossmember of the support part.
 According to another aspect of the invention, the fastening areas are situated on the side uprights of the support part.  Other features and advantages of the invention will become more clearly apparent on reading the following
description, given by way of an illustrative and nonlimiting example, and from the appended drawings in which:
 FIG. 1 shows a schematic representation of a front-end module,
 FIG. 2 shows a schematic representation of the fastening area for a headlight support on the support part,

 FIGS. 4a and 4b show a schematic representation of the movements and forces applied to a headlight in the event of a front impact,
 FIGS. 5a and 5b show a schematic representation of the movements and forces applied to a front-end module in the event of a front impact,
 FIGS. 6a to 6c show a schematic representation of the movements and forces applied to the link between the support part and the headlight support in the event of a front impact.
 The identical components in the different figures bear identical references.
 FIG. 1 shows a schematic representation of a front-end module 1.  Said front-end module 1 comprises a support part 3, 7, 8 to which can be fastened components such as cooling modules (not represented).  Said support part 3, 7, 8 comprises a
bottom crossmember 7, side uprights 8 and a top crossmember 3.  These different components can be of a single piece or else be independent parts fastened together.  Thus, the top crossmember 3 can be independent and be fastened to the top of the side
uprights 8.  The side uprights 8 and the bottom crossmember 7 can also form one and the same part, said part thus having a general ""U"" shape.
 The front-end module 1 also comprises, on each of its sides, headlight supports 5.  Said headlight supports 5 are fastened to the support part 3, 7, 8 on a dedicated fastening area 4 as well as to the chassis of the vehicle.  Said fastening area
4 also being able to be well situated on the top crossmember 3 (as shown in FIG. 1) or the side uprights 8.
 The front-end module 1 can also comprise a bumper beam 9 which helps to protect the components of the module in the event of a front impact.
 FIG. 2 shows a schematic representation of the fastening area for a headlight support 5 on the support part 3, 7, 8.  Said fastening area 4 comprises a fastening plate 41 at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the support part 3, 7, 8, to
which the headlight support 5 is fastened.  For this, the plate 41 includes an oblong notch 47 whose opening is directed toward the front of the vehicle and into which passes a fastening component allowing for fastening the headlight support 5 onto a
fastening axis A, for example a screw.  The fastening area 4 also includes a recess 43 that is open toward the front of the vehicle.
 FIG. 3 shows a schematic representation of a headlight support 5.  Said headlight support 5 notably includes a fastening means 53 for fastening the headlight support 5 to the plate 41 of the fastening area 4.  The fastening means 53 can, for
example, be a tapped orifice 53, as represented by FIG. 3, able to receive a screw or even a threaded rod able to receive a bolt, this makes it possible to fasten the headlight support 5 in the oblong notch 47 of the plate 41.
 The fastening of the headlight support 5 onto the fastening area 4 by virtue of the fastening means 53 thus defines a fastening axis A around which said headlight support 5 can undergo a revolution.  The fastening means 53 can also be a metallic
insert or other fastening system known to a person skilled in the art, defining a fastening axis A between the fastening area 4 and the headlight support 5.
 The headlight support 5 also includes a revolution component 51 situated on the fastening axis A. When the headlight support 51 is fastened to the fastening area 4, the revolution component is inserted into the complementary recess 43, said
recess 43 closely following the form of said revolution component 51.  This revolution component 51, being situated on the fastening axis A, makes it possible to absorb the pivoting stresses of the headlight support 5 around said fastening axis A.
 As shown by FIGS. 2 and 3, the revolution component 51 can have a cylindrical form and the recess 43 can consequently be semi-cylindrical in order to be able to accommodate it.
 The revolution component 51 can include a positioning component 55, at right angles to the fastening axis A. This positioning component 55 allows for the correct positioning of the fastening support 5 on the fastening area 4 and consequently the
positioning of the fastening support 5 relative to the support part 3, 7, 8.
 As shown by FIGS. 2 and 3, the positioning component 55 can be a pin 55 which, when the revolution component 51 is in the recess 43, is inserted into an orifice 45 situated inside said recess 43.  The pin 55 can be part of the same material as
the revolution component 51 or else said pin 55 can be an independent part, fastened to the revolution component 51 and can thus be replaced in the event of a breakage.
 Another embodiment (not represented) of the positioning component 55 can be that the revolution component 51 has a truncated cylindrical form with at least one planar facet, the planar facet or facets being situated on the portion of the
revolution component 51 that fits into the complementary recess 43 closely following the truncated cylindrical form of the revolution component 51.  For example, the revolution component 51 can have an octagonal form and the recess 43 takes on the
negative image of this form.
 The headlight support 5 also includes at least one fastening means for the headlight (not represented) as well as at least one means for fastening to the chassis of the vehicle (not represented).  Said support can, furthermore, also be fastened
to the support part 3, 7, 8 as well as to a wing of the motor vehicle.
 FIGS. 4a and 4b show a side view of the movements and motions undergone by a headlight 11 fastened onto its headlight support 5 and by a front face bar 13 of a motor vehicle.  FIG. 4a shows all of these components in position, before a front
impact, and FIG. 4b shows them after the front impact.
 The impact causes a rearward deformation of the face bar 13, that is to say toward the engine compartment, this deformation of the face bar imparting an upward pivoting force and motion, that is to say toward the hood of the vehicle, of the
headlight 11 and of the headlight support 5 to which it is fastened.
 For their part, FIGS. 5a and 5b show a schematic side view representation of the movements and forces undergone by a front face bar 13 of a motor vehicle, a bumper beam 9 and a support part 3, 7, 8, more particularly here by the top crossmember
3, in the event of a front impact.  FIG. 5a shows all of these components in position before a front impact, and FIG. 5b shows them after the front impact.
 The impact here causes a rearward deformation of the face bar 13, a rearward motion of the bumper beam 9 as well as a rearward motion and downward pivoting of the top crossmember 3.
 The pivoting motions of the headlight support 5 and of the support part 3, 7, 8 are therefore opposed and the front-end module 1 according to the invention makes it possible to take up these opposing motions.
 FIGS. 6a to 6c show a schematic side view representation of the movements and forces applied to the link between the support part 3, 7, 8, more particularly the top crossmember 3, and the headlight support 5 allowing for the absorption of these
opposing motions in the event of a front impact.
 FIG. 6a shows these different parts positioned relative to one another in running condition.  The headlight support 5 is fastened to the plate 41 at the notch 47 by virtue of the fastening means 53.  The revolution component 51 is inserted into
the recess 43.
 In the example shown by these figures, the positioning component 55 of the headlight support 5 is a pin 55 inserted into the orifice 45 of the recess 43.
 At the start of the front impact (FIG. 6b), the top crossmember 3 is subjected to a recoiling rearward motion, that is to say toward the engine compartment, and the headlight support 5 remains in its position because it is fastened to the
chassis of the vehicle.  By virtue of the notch 47 and the fastening means 43, the top crossmember 3 can recoil toward the engine compartment whereas the headlight support 5 remains immobile in translation because of its fastening to the chassis of the
vehicle.
 These two parts thus have opposing motions and because they can move independently of one another while remaining fastened to one another, there is no breaking of the fastening and/or of one of the two parts.
 Because of the rearward motion of the top crossmember 1, the revolution component 51 disengages from the recess 43.  The headlight support 5 also undergoes an upward pivoting motion, that is to say toward the hood of the vehicle, which is
absorbed because the headlight support 5 can rotate about the fastening axis A.
 In the case where the positioning component 55 is a pin, it can undergo significant stresses, notably in the event of a high speed impact, and give way because of the pivoting of the headlight support while it is still partly inserted into its
orifice 45.
 Later in the progress of the front impact (FIG. 6c), the amplitude of the rearward motions of the top crossmember 3 and the amplitude of the upward revolution of the headlight support 5 are greater.  The top crossmember 3 also undergoes a
downward pivoting motion about the fastening axis A and contrary to the upward pivoting motion about the fastening axis A of the headlight support 5.
 It can therefore be clearly seen that the possibility of the support part 3, 7, 8 and the headlight supports 5 have of being able to have opposing motions because of an impact makes it possible to safeguard against the possible breaking of one
or more of these parts and therefore allow for reduction in the repair costs as well as possibly the immobilization of the vehicle because of the impact and the damage to the equipment items supported by the support part 3, 7, 8.

 This Application claims priority to German Application No. DE 102011056016.5 filed on Dec.  5, 2011 in Germany and is herein incorporated by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The invention relates to a trim panel for the body of a motor vehicle.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Trim panels for the bodies of motor vehicles are known.  They serve to visually and aerodynamically bridge gaps between different outer skin parts of the body.  In addition, they serve as support structure for functional components such as for
example a seal.  A typical application example is the pillar panel, which covers the load-bearing bodywork parts of the A, B, C or D-pillar.  Another example is the frame-like trim panel in the region of the windscreen opening of the body.
 The requirements on trim panels, in particular on the surface quality on the outside, i.e. the visible side, are very high because of their function which co-shapes the vehicle outside, visually.  A very high surface quality is demanded, wherein
the surface is to be additionally embodied to be impact and scratch resistant as well as weather and aging-resistant.  Apart from this, the material of the trim panel must be employable over a large temperature range and must only have minor
temperature-related distortion values.  On the other hand, ductile-elastic characteristics are demanded for certain functions, namely in particular, where the material interacts with the body, for example in order to realize snap hooks, which are to
resiliently engage behind the vehicle body or of regions, into which the thread-shaping or thread-cutting screws are to cut.
 For the aforementioned reasons, trim panels were developed in the past, which are produced from thermoplastics by a multi-component injection molding method.  There, the portions of the trim panels located towards the non-visible side, which
frequently have a load-bearing function, are produced from a sufficiently ductile material such as for example from ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene).  By contrast, the portions located on the visible side of the trim panels are produced from a
material which makes possible a very high surface quality (""class A"") even without reworking.  Used for example is a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate).
 Such a construction however requires a high material strength of the trim panel, which in particular is due to the sufficiently known restrictions of the thermoplastic injection molding.  Added to this is that in the case of cross-sectional
chunks or material accumulations in the injection-molded trim panels, such as are typical for example in the region of the attachments of stiffening ribs, it has to be ensured with elaborate measures that as a consequence of the higher absolute shrinkage
during the cooling of the material at this location with material accumulation, no subsidence locations develop on the surface of the visible side directed to the outside.
 Starting out from this prior art, the invention is based on the object of providing a trim panel for the body of a motor vehicle, with which the disadvantages described above can be largely eliminated.  In particular, the trim panel may include
a design-appropriate embodiment preferably without production-related restrictions and has high-quality visual characteristics and a low weight.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 A trim panel according to the invention for the body of a motor vehicle, in particular a panel for the A, B, C, D-pillar of the body or for the windscreen-roof frame wherein the trim panel includes a basic body, which in a particular
configuration can also represent the entire trim panel, which is produced from a thermosetting plastic and is formed of a thermosetting plastic.
 The use according to the invention of one or a plurality of thermosetting plastics (preferentially 1-component) for forming the basic body of the trim panel has a multiplicity of advantages.  In addition to the favorable process ability of
thermosetting plastics also within the scope of a large series production, in particular through injection molding and pressing (including all sub and mixed forms of these methods, in particular injection stamping), in particular the following advantages
must be emphasized: thermosetting plastics can be adjusted with respect to their viscosity and their adhesive tendency in a wide range, as a result of which the production in particular within the scope of the abovementioned methods is simplified.  Added
to this is the favorable controllability of the hardening of the material, as a result of which, other than with the cooling of hardening thermoplastics, even thin and large-area components can be produced by injection-molding and/or pressing without
problems.  This makes thus possible the production of trim panels that are comparatively thin relative to conventional trim panels of thermoplastics.  Restrictions of the material thickness materialize only through the required mechanical strength of the
component and less through limits already posed by the production process.  The component weight can be reduced and the aerodynamic characteristics of the body provided with said component can be positively influenced through design measures, which a
designer was not able to use in the past.  This can also have a positive effect visually, for example through a more surface-flush appearance.  The high density of the thermosetting plastic can additionally improve the haptic and the acoustic behavior of
the trim panel.  Thermosetting plastics additionally have a very low distortion tendency in many instances, which makes possible the production of almost distortion-free trim panels.  In addition, thermosetting plastics are characterized by a low
post-shrinkage, which are particularly advantageous with respect to passing alternating climate tests, to which motor vehicles are exposed within the scope of the development.  Through the positive shrinkage characteristics, a wall thickness-rib ratio
can be additionally changed in the direction of 1:1, as a result of which sturdy trim panels with low weight can be produced.  Added to this are a very low expansion during heat storage and almost continuous mechanical characteristics in the temperature
range of -40.degree.  C. to 150.degree.  C. that is relevant for motor vehicle bodies.  Furthermore, many thermosetting plastics are characterized by low material costs, which lower the component costs.  Added to this is that sealing foams or other
elements in many cases favorably adhere to the thermosetting plastic even without additional process steps.
 In a preferred embodiment of the trim panel according to the invention, the basic body is at least partially or completely produced from BMC (bulk molding compound) or SMC (sheet molding compound), in particular in the form of so-called low
profile or low shrinkage molding compounds.  These plastic fiber composites include thermosetting plastics and may include further filling materials for a specific characteristic modulation and which are frequently present in the form of molding
compounds that are similar to plasticine.  The compounds make possible the cost-effective production of trim panels within the scope of the abovementioned methods for large series production, i.e. in particular by means of injection molding or pressing,
including all sub and mixed forms of these methods, in particular injection stamping.  The methods produce parts with simultaneously high mechanical strengths (among other things because of the fiber reinforcement) and favorable surface characteristics
(""class A"" surfaces).
 The use of thermosetting plastics for producing the trim panel or the basic body of the trim panel according to the invention makes possible in particular the advantageous production of components which with respect to conventional trim panels
of thermoplastics can be embodied very thinly.  It has proved to be advantageous if the thickness of the areal portions of the basic body, i.e. such portions without reinforcements, transitions, etc., does not amount to substantially more than 3 mm and
preferentially not more than approximately 2 mm.  Because of this, in conjunction with the mechanical strengths of the thermosetting plastics and in particular of BMC or SMC, a trim panel can be created, which despite relatively low wall thickness has a
strength that is adequate for non-load bearing components of the outer skin of a body.  With a wall thickness of approximately 2 mm, the wall thickness of conventional trim panels, which amounts to approximately 4 mm, can be reduced by up to 50%.
 The advantageous characteristics of thermosetting plastics, which make possible the production of particularly thin areal components also in the mentioned methods for the large series production, also make possible a preferred configuration of
the basic body such that the latter tapers towards the edge in at least one edge region.  Because of this, the possibility of an aerodynamically and also visually advantageous configuration of the trim panel is created for a configuration becoming
thinner towards the edge cannot only positively influence the aerodynamics, for example in the form of a preferably low separation edge, but also improves the possibilities for realizing as surface-flush an appearance of the body as possible.  With a
view to the advantageous aerodynamic characteristics that can be achieved, such a taper should be provided in particular for such edges of the trim panel which by forming a step-like shoulder to the adjoining vehicle surface, in particular to the
adjoining window surface, constitute a flow separation edge on which wind noises or turbulences can undesirably occur.  It is pointed out that such a material thickness tapering cannot be realized with conventional trim panels from thermoplastics,
because on the one hand the material strength of thermoplastics does not permit such a reduction of the material thickness and because on the other hand the necessary low spacing of the injection mold jaws necessary for such a material thickness
reduction is problematic on account of the cooling of the injection molding compound that is too rapid with the injection molding process.  The chemically hardening molding compounds provided for the trim panels according to the invention ensure a
uniform molded part filling in the injection molding process even with low wall thicknesses, in part due to a favorable flow behavior within the tool.
 The tapered edge region of the trim panel can for example be achieved through an angled-off and/or arch-shaped curve of a side of the basic body serving as a visual side of the trim panel.
 Furthermore, the basic body of the trim panel can be provided with a coating in at least one portion, which in particular can be designed in the form of a paint layer and/or in addition to a paint layer, can comprise further layers such as for
example a priming layer.  This makes possible the color coating matched to the remaining outer skin parts of the body, provided the desired color coding cannot already be achieved through suitable filler materials.  Thus, even minute color deviations
relative to the body paintwork later on can be avoided.  Particularly preferably, a high-gloss black paint coating may be employed as a coating.  Since the coating of the basic body, in particular with a paint layer, because of the corrosion resistance
of the thermosetting plastics frequently serves only for visual reasons, it can be preferentially provided to provide the coating on a side of the basic body serving as visible side of the trim panel and in particular only on this visible side.  The
component surface can for example be provided with a paint system such as a urea based, EPS polyester based or polyurethane bases paint system.  Alternatively, the use of thermosetting plastics for forming the basic body of the trim panel according to
the invention can also make possible a through-coloring of the plastic, as a result of which a cost-effective possibility of coloring can be realized.  In an additional preferred embodiment of the trim panel according to the invention it can be provided
to form the thermosetting plastic for forming the basic body in an electrically conductive manner, which can be achieved by admixing electrically conductive filler materials.  Through the electrically conductive compounding, the possibility is created in
particular to coat the trim panel according to the invention, if required jointly with other metallic outer skin components of the body, in an electrostatic coating and in particular painting method in a particularly scratch-resistant manner.
 The trim panel according to the invention can furthermore comprise one or a plurality of functional elements fastened to the basic body.  These can in particular consist of elastomers or also of a liquid silicone and for example serve as sealing
elements and/or elastic spacing members which make possible the vibration-free and low-noise fastening of the trim panel to the body.  The forming of the basic body from thermosetting plastic according to the invention in this case has the advantage that
many elastomers can be fixed to the plastic even without additional process steps or adhesive means.  In addition it offers the possibility of integrating the functional element or functional elements in the basic body within the scope of its production,
as is possible for example within the scope of a multi-component injection molding method. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

mechanical characteristics, forms holding members of the trim panel 1.  The basic body 3 forms a U-shaped mounting in the wider sense via a web originating on the inside, within which, subject to the intermediate connection of a sealing element inserted
in the mounting, an edge region of the side window 2 is guided.
 Since an injection molding of a tough-ductile thermoplastic is not suitable for the visible side of a trim panel, which does not allow achieving an adequate surface quality and scratch-resistance, the basic body 3 is connected to a covering body
4 of impact-tough rather glass-like thermoplastics (e.g. PMMA).  The latter forms the surfaces which constitute the visible side of the trim panel.  The use of for example PMMA makes possible forming ""class A""-appropriate surfaces directly during
injection molding, i.e. without relevant reworking.  The connection of the two components is preferably realized in the two-component injection molding process.
 The production of the trim panel 1 in the multi-component injection molding process required for visual reasons in conjunction with the material-specific restriction of the minimal thicknesses of the basic body 3 that can be achieved for example
from ABS and of the covering body 4 for example from PMMA results in that such conventional trim panels 1 are currently not produced with a wall thickness ""S"" lower than approximately 4 mm and additionally not with different regions having varying
material thicknesses.  Edges tapering towards the margin as would be desirable for visual and aerodynamic reasons cannot be realized.  Added to this is that the height ""H"" of the step-like transition from the visible side surface of the trim panel 1 to
the surface of the window pane 2 is relatively large, so that in this region undesirable and aerodynamically unfavorable turbulences due to the headwind ""W"" occur.  In addition to this, indentations 5 on the non-visible side have to be provided with such
conventional trim panels in many cases in order to avoid material agglomerations, which, because of the thin uneven shrinkage behavior, could lead to subsidence locations which are noticeable also on the visible side and are therefore unacceptable. 
During the production, these indentations 5 frequently constitute undercuts, which could render de-molding of the components more difficult and unnecessarily complicate an injection molding tool.
 The FIGS. 2 to 4 show three exemplary embodiments of a trim panel.  The features shown in the respective Figures can be realized jointly or in each case individually and are, each taken on its own and also in their entirely as independent
inventions.
 The trim panel 1 of the three embodiments includes a basic body 3, which forms the entire (FIG. 2 and FIG. 4) or almost the entire window frame (FIG. 3).  The basic body 3 was produced from BMC as part of an injection molding process, as a
result of which a component was created that not only has adequate strength to fulfill the load-bearing function of the part but also makes available a ""class A""-appropriate surface quality even without reworking.  Because of this, the trim panel 1, when
colored through with the desired tone of color, can be directly employed as outer skin part of the body or with paint without further coatings provided for improving the surface quality.  FIG. 3 shows such an embodiment of a window frame according to the
invention, in the case of which the basic body 3, if required, after the applying of a prime coat (not shown) was coated with a thin paint layer 6.
 Through the production of the basic body 3 from a glass fiber-permeated thermosetting plastic molding compound a material thickness ""s"" of the window frame can be achieved, which in the areal portions is configured thinner than the counterpart
of thermoplastics known from FIG. 1 (s.quadrature.S applies).  Despite this, an adequate mechanical strength is achieved, namely even with a preferred material thickness of the basic body of approximately 2 mm.  With a coating with a paint layer (see
FIG. 3), the paint layer thickness, which depending on the applied coating method or paint used, can amount up to approximately 500 .mu.m, has to be added so that the overall thickness then amounts to approximately 2.5 mm.  A component that is light
compared with a conventional trim panel and visually more unobtrusive component can be created.  Further, the spacing of the visible side surface from the window surface ""h"" can be significantly reduced (h.quadrature.H applies), namely at least by the
amount by which the material is reduced such as by approximately 2 mm.
 Additionally, because of the substantially non-existing shrinkage behavior of the thermosetting plastic employed, the forming of the indentations 5 in the region of the transverse web attachments frequently required with the conventional trim
panels can be omitted (see relevant locations at the trim panels of FIGS. 2 to 4), as a result of which a de-molding of the component after the production is facilitated and the tool manufacture simplified.
 With the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 4, the marginal region constituting a part of the visible side of the window frame 1 tapers towards the margin to a thickness of approximately 0.4 mm, as a result of which not only an aerodynamic advantage
through the formation of a small separation edge can be achieved (the arrow in FIG. 3 shows the direction of the headwind W), but as surface-flush a transmission from the trim panel 1 to the surface of the window pane 2 as possible which is desired in
many cases for visual reasons, is obtained.  Such a tapering, in the shown example from 2 mm to approximately 1 mm, with favorable technical preconditions to up to 0.5 mm or even 0.4 mm, cannot be realized by the injection molding method with
thermoplastics that harden because of the cooling, since the process-safe entering of the thermoplastics in the injection molding process in such narrow tool gaps with the lengths and surfaces to be produced in this application case cannot be guaranteed. The targeted temperature-controlling of a tool, with which this would be at least theoretically conceivable even with thermoplastics, is no alternative for the production of a cost-effective motor vehicle body component because of the tool expenditure
and the required cycle times.
 Here, the tapering region evidently extends over a length (L) which is longer by a multiple than the material thickness ""s"".  Preferably, L>2.times.s applies, further preferably L>3.times.s applies.
 FIG. 5 shows the window frames 1 of FIGS. 1 to 4 in a lateral view initially for illustration purposes.  There it is evident that it is divided into two portions, which significantly differ in the width.  While the upper, wider portion 7 is a
visible portion of the window frame 1, the lower, narrower portion 8 in the assembled state dips into the breast of the door of the motor vehicle and is therefore is not visible from the outside on the produced motor vehicle.
 With the configuration of the window frame 1 according to the prior art (FIG. 1) it is necessary to provide the covering body 4 serving in particular visual reasons only in the visible portion 7; the lower portion 8 of the trim panel 1 by
contrast merely consists of the basic body 3, which dips into the door breast 9 and in the assembled state is covered by the panel 10 of the vehicle door.  The cross-sectional overlap resulting from this and shown in the longitudinal section of FIG. 6
constitutes a weak point that is subjected to stress peak loads as a result of a notch effect, which increases the fracture tendency of the trim panel 1 at this point and as a consequence can lead to a component failure.
 Such a cross-sectional overlap is not present with the trim panels (FIGS. 2 to 4) according to the invention because of the constant thickness design.  At most, an extremely small cross-sectional overlap can be provided when the visible portion
7 is coated with a paint layer 6 (see FIG. 7).  The notch effect connected with this however is negligible, since the paint layer 6 exclusively serves for visual reasons and other than the covering layer 5 with the trim panel 1 according to the prior art
does not cause any stress peaks as a result of the low layer thickness.
 The design details of the three exemplary embodiments described cannot only be applied merely in the concrete combination disclosed, but these can also be applied in any combination even with any other trim panels according to the invention. 
For example, the embodiment according to FIG. 4 can be provided with a coating (paint layer 6) according to the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3.

",,"FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The invention generally concerns a rear spoiler device for a vehicle, such as for a utility vehicle or a trailer.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Utility vehicles such as heavy goods vehicles or buses, or trailers of heavy goods vehicles, generally have a box shape, which allows for effective use of available loading space and direct access to the loading space via the rear.  During
travel, however, the box shape leads to severe breakaway turbulence behind the rear of the vehicle and, hence, to poor aerodynamic properties.  Rear spoilers serve to improve the aerodynamics of a vehicle and can reduce fuel consumption, accordingly.
 For this, DE 10 2009 014 860 A1 proposes forming a rear spoiler for a utility vehicle on the sides and upper edge of the rear with several adjustable air guiding surfaces, which are substantially curved inward and adjustable separately in order
to adapt automatically to the respective air flow during travel.
 Some utility vehicles have attachments with an access opening at the rear, which is closed by a roller shutter.  Such vehicles can generally be reversed up to a ramp without the driver first having to get out in order to open the roller shutter. With rear spoiler designs such as described in DE 10 2009 014 860 A1, reversing up to a ramp is problematic due to the air guide surfaces protruding at the rear.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 Generally speaking, it is an object of the present invention to provide a rear spoiler device for a vehicle that permits easy access to the rear of the vehicle.
 The present invention is based on the concept of allowing automatic movability of the lateral rear spoiler device by mechanical contact at, e.g., a docking station during a reversing approach or parking process.  Here, movement is possible
between a travel position, in which the air guiding element(s) form(s) the aerodynamically advantageous contour extension towards the rear, and a stowed position or unloading position with the air guiding element(s) lying fully or largely against the
rear.
 The stowed position serves for loading and unloading of the vehicle via the rear access opening, and is established on a reverse approach to an object.
 Thus, the driver can reverse the vehicle up to a ramp or loading station so that, on contact with the ramp or loading station, the rear spoiler device moves or is retracted or folded in automatically without the driver needing to get out.  This
is advantageous in particular in the case of a vertically opening closure on the rear of the vehicle, e.g., a shutter door or a vertically liftable tarpaulin.  Once at the ramp or loading station, the rear access door can be opened without interference
from the rear spoiler device, the vehicle can be loaded and/or unloaded in the conventional manner, and then, after closing the rear access opening, the vehicle can be driven away, with the lateral rear spoiler device or the air guiding element(s) moving
automatically into the travel position.
 A center rear spoiler device can be arranged between lateral rear spoiler devices on the roof or upper edge of the rear, and, e.g., remain unchanged if it does not hinder the loading and unloading process.
 Advantageously, in the retracted stowed position, the air guiding element(s) do(es) not protrude disruptively towards the middle, i.e., towards the rear access opening.  For this, the rear spoiler device advantageously has a shift mechanism,
preferably an articulated rod mechanism, which allows the movement of the air guiding element(s) between the stowed and travel positions, and, advantageously, also creates spring loading.  The shift mechanism can guide the air guiding element(s)
outwardly on folding, so that, in folded state, it/they do(es) not block the access opening to the rear.
 Thus, longer air guiding elements, which allow more favorable aerodynamic properties, can also be used without blocking the access opening.  Air guiding element length is not limited in principle according to the present invention.
 The articulated rod mechanism can be formed by two rods, of which the first, front rod is hinged directly or indirectly to the vehicle frame or part of the vehicle frame, and the rear, second rod is hinged to the first rod and, in turn, holds an
air guiding element.  Advantageously, the two rods have different lengths; in the travel position, the first rod extends rearward and laterally outward, whereupon the second rod extends rearward and towards the middle.  The first rod is preferably longer
than the second rod, e.g., the length of the first rod is approximately equal to the sum of the lengths of the second rod and a region of the air guiding element between its connecting hinge on the second rod and its rear end.
 Such an articulated rod mechanism can be achieved with relatively few components, e.g., only the first and second rods, and suitable stops to establish the travel position and the angular positions in the travel position, and corresponding
springs.  Advantageously, springs are provided in the three hinges to allow a dynamic shift between the different positions on a reversing approach.  For this, e.g., the air guiding element can be swiveled on contact with the ramp and come into its
relatively flat stowed position, and then the rods can be folded in. Here, the shift mechanism can be formed by several such articulated rod mechanisms, which can be provided vertically spaced between the frame and the air guiding element.
 Because of the foldability, in particular on the rear hinge, the air guiding element can swivel when loaded by the contact.  Its inwardly curved form here allows a relatively gentle roiling of the air guiding element on the ramp or resistance so
that no extensive mechanical damage is expected, and even on harder impacts, a flexibility is achieved due to the multipiece hinge mechanism, in particular also the angles between the rods.
 Production of the rear spoiler device is also favorable, e.g., in an embodiment with a larger air guiding element, made, for example, from plastic, reinforced plastic, or sheet metal, and an articulated rod mechanism of, e.g., rods and hinge
inserts of springs and stop fittings, due to low material costs.
 Still other objects and advantages of the present invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification.
 The present invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combination of elements, and arrangement of parts, all as exemplified in the constructions herein set forth, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the
claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
 The invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings directed to one exemplary embodiment in which.

 FIG. 2 is a top view of the lateral rear region of the vehicle on approach to a ramp;
 FIG. 3 shows a hinge structure from FIG. 2;
 FIGS. 4-9 illustrate the folding or retraction process of the rear spoiler device according to FIG. 1 on approach to the ramp; and
 FIG. 9 depicts the lateral rear region in the retracted or folded stowed position for loading the vehicle.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 A utility vehicle 1 can, e.g., be a truck or a trailer (goods vehicle trailer).  FIG. 1 shows the rear region of the utility vehicle 1 with wheels 2, a vehicle frame (superstructure) 3 and side wails 4.  The side walls 4 can be solid, e.g., in a
box trailer made of metal, or formed, e.g., by tarpaulins carried by the structural parts of the vehicle frame 3.
 An access opening 6 for the loading space of the utility vehicle 1 is provided on the rear 5, and is closed by a roller shutter 7, which can be retracted vertically upwards.  The roller shutter 7 consists of several elements 7-1 overlapping in
the manner of slats.  Thus, the access opening 6 of the utility vehicle 1 is not closed by rear doors swinging laterally rearwards.  Instead of the roller shutter 7, another closure device can be provided that does not open towards the rear, in
particular, a closure that opens vertically upwards or inwards such as, e.g., a retractable tarpaulin of flexible material.  It is relevant that no swinging room to the rear is required in order to open the closure device 7.
 The utility vehicle 1 can therefore reverse close to an unloading station, e.g., a ramp 8 shown in FIG. 2 or a seal to the ramp, for unloading, so that the driver or a user can then open the roller shutter 7 or the other closure device, e.g.,
manually or by electric operation.
 Two lateral rear spoiler devices 10 are arranged in the rear region of the utility vehicle 1 and are fixed directly or indirectly to the vehicle frame 3.  If the side walls 4 are formed rigidly and attached to the vehicle frame, fixing to the
side walls 4 is also possible.
 Each of the lateral rear spoiler devices 10 has an air guiding element 12, which in the extended or travel position (drive position) in FIGS. 1 and 2 extends the area of the side walls 4 towards the back and, thus, extends further to the back
from the rear 5.  The air guiding element 12 is, e.g., bent (curved) inward and, advantageously, extends over the entire height of the side walls 4; it can be made of lightweight material such as plastic or from sheet metal.  The length of the air
guiding element 12 towards the rear is in principle freely configurable and not limited.  The aerodynamic curvature of the air guiding element 12 is known; in particular, a direct breakaway edge at the lateral rear region or at the transition of the side
walls 4 to the rear 5 is avoided.
 The rear spoiler devices 10 can be moved automatically between the travel position shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 and the stowed position shown in FIG. 9 by contact on a rear object, in particular, the ramp 8.  For this, they are spring-preloaded in the
travel position in FIGS. 1 and 2, as will be explained in more detail below.
 Between the two lateral rear spoiler devices 10, in the upper region of the rear 5.  e.g., an upper middle rear spoiler device 11 can be provided, which is preferably not moved.  The upper middle rear spoiler device, here, shown in the travel
position, transforms substantially, for example, into the lateral rear spoiler devices 10 in order to form a rear spoiler arrangement that is closed at both sides and at the top.
 Each of the rear spoiler devices 10 can have, in addition to the air guiding element 12, a shift mechanism 14, which guarantees the movability and elastic preload of the air guiding element 12 in relation to the rear 5.  According to the
embodiment shown, the shift mechanism 14 is formed by three vertically spaced, articulated rod mechanisms 15.  In FIG. 1, this formation is shown on the left rear spoiler device 10, Each articulated rod mechanism 15 has two rods (braces) 16, 17 and three
hinges 18, 19, 20.
 The first rod 16 is attached to the rear 5 at the first hinge 18, preferably, to the vehicle frame 3 or the end of the side wall 5.  Thus, the first hinge 18 serves also as a fixing device for the entire rear spoiler device 10 on the rear 5 or
the vehicle frame 3 in the region of the rear 5.  The second hinge 19 connects the rods 16 and 17, of which the second rod 17 is shorter than the first rod 16, e.g., half as long or even shorter.  The third hinge 20 connects the air guiding element 12
with the second rod 17.  The hinges 18, 19, 20, as indicated by arrows in FIG. 2, are preloaded in the opened spring position shown.  The spring force consequently acts along the arrow direction to enlarge the angle.  Thus, the first rod 16 is pressed
rearward away from the side wail or rear, the second rod 17 is pressed into a rearward pointing position and the air guiding element 12 is, in turn, preloaded by springs, such that with its front end 12a, it terminates approximately flush or level with
the side wall 4.  As shown, the air guiding element 12 can protrude slightly laterally so that it lies on the side wall 4 under spring preload.  The rear end 12b of the air guiding element 12 protrudes freely to the rear.
 The hinges 18, 19, 20 furthermore have stops so that the angular positions shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 are maintained.  The stops can be formed by additional components or by the configuration of the rods 16, 17 themselves.  FIG. 3 shows such an
arrangement as an example for the hinge 19, which can be transferred accordingly to hinges 18 and 20.  The hinge 19--also shown alone on the left--has a spring for opening the angle between the rods 16 and 17.  The spring 22 is, preferably, formed as a
leg spring, here with two legs, wherein, due to the spring effect of the spring 22, the stops 36b and 17a of rods 16 and 17 are pressed against each other.  These stops 16b and 17a can be parts of the rods 16 or 17 or additional components attached to
the rods 16, 17, together with the spring 22 as a hinge 19.
 Thus, a stop on the vehicle frame 3 is provided at the hinge 18; correspondingly at hinge 20 there is a stop on the air guiding element 12, or the frame 3 and the air guiding element 12 themselves serve as a corresponding stop.
 The hinges 18, 19, 20 are thus preloaded in the travel position shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 and defined by stops.
 As evident, e.g., from the view in FIG. 2, an angle of less than 180.degree.  to the inside or to the center line of the vehicle is formed between the rods 16 and 17.  The hinge 19 also lies laterally further out than the hinge 20, and the hinge
20 lies laterally further out than the front end 12b of the air guiding element 12.  This ensures that, on contact, and, hence, on pressure loading on the end 12b of the air guiding element 12, the folding process described according to FIGS. 3 to 9
below can take place automatically,
 When the utility vehicle 1 reverses up to the ramp 8, the air guiding element 12 with its end 12b or an end region makes contact with the ramp 8, which here, e.g., has a rubber buffer surrounding it on three sides in the usual manner.  According
to FIG. 4, the contact point 24 is generally formed between the end 12b and the hinge 20, i.e., on the outside of the air guiding element 12.  The ramp 8 thus exerts a forward-acting force F on the air guiding element 12 at the contact point 24, wherein
this contact point 24 can then generally change since, according to FIGS. 4 to 9, the air guiding element 12 swivels in and thus brings its curved outside into different contact points against the spoiler 8.  The force F with the corresponding lever arm
therefore exerts a torque on the hinges 20, 19, 18, which acts against the spring effect of the respective springs 22.
 The further folding process takes place depending on the resulting lever arms and spring strengths of the three springs 22 of the hinges 18, 19 and 20.  The hinge mechanism 15 here folds in so that the angles between the rod 16 and the frame 3,
and between the two rods 16 and 17, become smaller and hence the hinge 20 in which the air guiding element 12 is held comes closer to the frame 3.  The air guiding element 12 can roll or slide slightly on the ramp 8, so that the angle between the rod 17
and the air guiding element 12 can, e.g., initially become larger, as evident from FIGS. 4, 5 and 6, and then reduce again on further reversing according to FIGS. 7, 8 and 9.
 For this, the spring strength of the hinge 20 is, e.g., designed slightly weaker than the spring strengths of hinges 18 and 19, where applicable, taking into account the lever arms, so that, on reversing approach according to FIGS. 4, 5, 6,
first the air guiding element 12 comes to rest against the ramp 8 and the contact point 24 lies, e.g., substantially close to the hinge 20.  Then, the rods 16, 17 fold in further, in the folded state, i.e., in the stowed position in FIG. 9, the air
guiding element 12 with its rear end 12b now extends laterally approximately as far as the frame 3 or the hinge 18, so that the air guiding element 12b does not hinder or significantly restrict access to the access opening 6 after the raising of the
roller shutter 7.  Thus, the length of the first rod 16 substantially corresponds to the sum of the lengths of the second rod 17 and the portion of the air guiding element 12 between the hinge 20 and its end 12b, as evident from FIG. 9.
 If the automatic folding process is hindered or problematical because of the configuration of the ramp 8, this folding process can also be initiated manually by a user, by pressing in the air guiding element 12 in the region of its front end
12b.
 In principle, a lock for the rear spoiler device 10 in the stowed position in FIG. 9 can be provided.  If the rear spoiler device 10 is pressed in by hand, it can therefore be fixed by such a lock.  The lock can, e.g., be formed by an additional
rod between the hinges 18 and 20.  In principle, however, such a lock is not required.
 The air guiding element 12 can also be multipiece, i.e., divided into horizontal sections, so that each of the parts is carried by a corresponding rod mechanism 15.  The one-piece design is, however, advantageous so that, on reversing approach
to the ramp 18, the entire air guiding element 12 is folded in with only one contact point 24.
 After loading the utility vehicle 1, the roller shutter 7 can be closed again and the utility vehicle 1 can drive ahead so that the rear spoiler device 10 automatically unfolds again according to the process in FIG. 9, back to the travel
position of FIGS. 1 and 2.
 Instead of the articulated rod mechanism 15 of two rods 16 and 18, the air guiding element 12 can, e.g., be made of super-elastic material with suitable forming, i.e., a substantially curved development corresponding to the rods 16, 17.  The
hinges 18 and 20 can therefore be omitted.
 It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained, and since certain changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, it is
intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
 It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover ail of the generic and specific features of the invention herein described and all statements of the scope of the invention that, as a matter of language, might be said
to fall therebetween.

 1.  Field of the Invention
 The present invention relates to a system and apparatus for enclosing a flat bed trailer or vehicle with removable sidewall panels and a bow-supported tarpaulin cover, and also relates to a flatbed truck trailer incorporating the cover system. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to such a removable cover system, and various components of the system, which provides improved convenience, safety, weather-resistance, fuel and storage efficiency, aesthetic appeal, as well as additional
advantages, in comparison to other known tarpaulin cover systems which may be used for covering flatbed trailer surfaces and the like.
 2.  Description of the Background Art
 Removable cover systems for flatbed trailers and the like, including stake-supported panels extending longitudinally along sides of the trailer and a bow-supported tarp cover secured over the trailer and the upper portions of the panels are well
known.  These systems are typically referred to as tarp-and-rack systems or side kits.  Versions of the conventional systems have been commercially available for many years and are relatively popular in North America.
 The conventional systems generally include removable panels, panel-supporting stakes, stake-supporting pockets provided in spaced fashion along the lateral sides of a flatbed trailer and which removably receive/retain lower ends of the stakes,
tarp-supporting bows, each having lower ends detachably supported by a pair of the stakes on opposite sides of the trailer, a tarp cover which may be selectively draped over and supported by the bows, and elastic straps which secure the lower edges of
the tarp cover to the trailer.  In use of the conventional systems the tarp cover may be selectively removed or folded, one or more of the bows removed, one or more of the stakes removed, and one or more of the panels removed over to expose portions of
the covered flatbed surface so that cargo may be selectively loaded onto or removed from the exposed portions of the covered surface.
 FIG. 21 herein depicts a lateral side portion of a flatbed trailer 1 having conventional stake-retaining pockets 2 fixed/welded to a steel or other metal member 8 extending along a lateral side surface of the trailer's bed, and a flat elongate
bumper bar or rail 3 fixed to the outside surfaces of the pockets.  FIG. 22 herein depicts a conventional stake 4 which secures a vertical side edge of a panel 5 inserted in a receiving recess 6 of the stake, where the stake is suspended above a
receptacle socket 7 of a conventional pocket 2.  In the conventional system depicted in FIG. 22, the panel 5 is rested on and is supported by an upper side edge portion of the bed of the trailer 1 or on the member 8, while the stake 4 is supported in the
pocket 2 such that an inwardly-facing side of the stake includes a pair of slots 6 which receive and retain vertically-extending edges of a pair of the panels 5, and a main body portion of the stake 4 extends outwardly beyond the side edge of the trailer
1, and outboard of the panel 5.
 The conventional systems are mostly effective for their intended purpose, which is reflected by the fact that the conventional system has not changed significantly over the years and remains popular in the trucking industry.  Over the years,
some efforts have been made to address a number of disadvantages associated with the conventional systems, including those discussed below.
 U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,794,375 to Woodward (the '375 patent) discloses a flatbed enclosure system having stakes, panels and a tarp cover, but wherein the panel edge receiving recesses of the stakes are notched in a vertically spaced manner and the
edges of the panels having associated recesses defined therealong as shown in FIG. 10 of the '375 patent.  With such structure, the stake does not have to be completely removed in order to release the panels, and this is desirable because the stakes are
typically around four feet long, and are usually removed by sliding their entire length vertically above the panels.  Due to the notched structure, a panel may be raised only a few inches until the recesses in its side edges are aligned away from the
stake notches, at which point the panel may be removed with the stake still retained on the trailer.
 U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,811,724 to Woodward (the '724 patent) discloses a flatbed enclosure system having two-section stakes, wherein an inner section may be separated from an outer section via vertical sliding movement to facilitate removal of the
panels, which have vertical side edges retained in recesses defined between the two sections of the stakes.  However, an individual must typically be standing inside the trailer to manipulate the two-section stakes, e.g., while standing in the trailer
the individual may lift and remove the smaller inner section of the stake, while the larger outer section of the stake remains in the supporting pocket.
 Also, this patent discloses special cargo-securing brackets (see FIGS. 6-7 of the '724 patent) having first ends fixed to sides of the flatbed, and which extend inwardly of the cargo space between the upper surface of the flatbed and the lower
edges of the panels such that the second ends of the brackets may have cargo-securing straps or chains connected thereto.  These brackets avoid the conventional necessity of extending the cargo-securing straps and chains between the flatbed and lower
edges of the panels, and thus also avoid the conventional gaps created by same.
 U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,067,601 to Tuerk discloses a stake arrangement for these types of systems in which the stakes are generally triangular in cross sectional shape rather than rectangular, while a lower portion of the stake, as received by the
retaining pockets on the trailer, is provided with a jacket which strengthens and enlarges the stake at the lower portion, and is tapered or the like to provide a relatively tight fit between the outer surface of the jacket and the inner surface of a
retaining pocket.
 U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,320,396 to Petelka discloses a flatbed enclosure system having a stake construction in which an outer surface of the stake is rounded off, to improve the aerodynamics of the trailer when the enclosure system is installed.
 U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,042,275 to Glassmeyer et al. discloses a cap that attaches to the upper end of stakes used in a flatbed enclosure system.  The cap prevents water and debris from entering the inner cavity of the stake.  Additionally, the stake
cap also provides a receiving hole for the end of a tarp support bow.
 The known tarp-and-rack systems provide several beneficial features, including that they are partially or fully removable, thereby permitting a user to uncover only selected portions of the trailer for loading and unloading cargo, and because
the systems are relatively inexpensive in comparison, for example, to permanent trailer cover systems such as the aluminum shells used to cover many trailers.
 However, the known systems still have disadvantages associated therewith.  For example, it is labor-intensive to install or remove such a system, e.g., edges of the tarp cover are secured with numerous elastic cords or the like to the flatbed
trailer, the stakes and panels must be individually, manually installed and removed, and the person operator doing the installation and removal must typically be standing on the trailer, which is highly inconvenient (especially if cargo is loaded on the
trailer), and also potentially dangerous.
 Further, the stakes extend outwardly of the panels, such that the system does not have a smooth continuous outer surface and is not particularly aerodynamic.  Often there is a loose fit between the stakes and retaining pockets for same provided
at the sides of the trailer, such that the stakes and the panels rattle and move when the vehicle is traveling.
 Still further, lower edges of the panels are typically supported on upper, outermost surfaces of the flatbed.  This not only reduces cargo space on the trailer, but due to curvature of the flatbed in the longitudinal direction, gaps are formed
between the panels and the trailer surface, permitting water, dirt and other matter to enter the enclosed space within the cover system, which is undesirable for many reasons.  Further, if the cargo must be secured to the trailer, as is often the case,
securing straps and chains must typically pass between the panels and the flatbed surface creating additional gaps as discussed above.  Also, the conventional systems do not have a particularly aesthetic appearance.
 Although some of the disadvantages of some older conventional systems have been addressed, as discussed above, a need still exists in the art for an improved flatbed cover system which more completely addresses all of the disadvantages attendant
the conventional systems.  In particular, there is a need for such an improved system that may be readily, conveniently and safely installed or removed by an individual standing at ground level adjacent a flatbed trailer, has significantly improved
aerodynamic, water- and weather-tight, has aesthetic characteristics, has a reduced number of parts, and is otherwise functionally, structurally and aesthetically superior to the conventional trailer cover systems.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention has been created with the intention of meeting the discussed need.
 It is an object of the present invention to provide a flexible seal mechanism for use with a cover system having removable panels, which seal mechanism cooperates with the panels to provide an excellent barrier against water and other foreign
matter entering into a cargo storage space within the system, is convenient to use, and may be retrofitted to conventional systems as well as being used as a component of the novel cover system of the present application.
 It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved tarpaulin and stake-supported panel cover system for a flatbed trailer which, according to an illustrative embodiment hereof, includes a plurality of panels and support stakes,
a flexible seal mechanism, and an elevated, optionally retractable tarpaulin cover system, which combine to form a high quality, versatile enclosure with enhanced characteristics, including protection for cargo on the trailer, simplicity and safety of
use, aerodynamics, and appearance.
 It is a further object of this invention to provide sidewall panels and support mechanisms such that the panels form a substantially flat and uniform outer sidewall surface along lateral sides of a flatbed trailer using a reduced number of
components for improved aerodynamics, improved appearance, reduced weight and cost, and increased cargo space.
 It is a yet another object of this invention to provide a cover system of the discussed type that allows for stakes used for retaining the sidewalls to be attached to the system and easily removable from the system without the use of retaining
pockets.
 It is another object of this invention to provide a cover system of the discussed type that eliminates the conventional need for numerous ropes or elastic straps for securing a tarp cover of the system.
 It is still another object of this invention to provide a cover system of the discussed type including a support mechanism for a tarp cover of the system, which greatly facilitates manipulation of the tarp cover by an operator and also greatly
improves the aerodynamics, securability, durability, and aesthetic appearance of the cover.
 According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a sealing device for use in a cover system for a substantially flat support surface on a vehicle including vertically-extending removable panels, the sealing device comprising a
first portion which is adapted to securely engage lower surfaces of the panels, and a second flexible portion which extends continuously from the first portion and is adapted to sealingly engage the vehicle.  The sealing device may extend substantially
along the full length of the lateral sides and rear of the vehicle, and the second flexible portion may include multiple spaced arms which are adapted to engage different surfaces of the vehicle, e.g., the upper supporting surface and a vertical side
surface, to more surely prevent passage of water and other foreign matter into the covered storage space.
 Such a sealing device according to the first aspect of the invention is very advantageous because (among other reasons) there tends to be substantial spaces between the lower portions of the panels and vehicle, and the seal is effective to
prevent water and other foreign matter from passing through the spaces into the covered storage area.  Also, because the second portion of the seal is flexible, cargo-securing chains, ropes, straps, etc. may readily pass between the seal and the vehicle
via flexing of the second portion, and the flexed second portion remains in close contact therewith as an effective seal.
 According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a cover system for a substantially flat support surface on a vehicle including plural removable panels, a lower support adapted to support lower surfaces of the panels when the
panels are operatively disposed at a lateral side of the flat support surface, and an upper rail adapted to retain upper surfaces of the panels when the panels are operatively disposed at a lateral side of the flat support surface, wherein edge portions
of said panels are shaped to overlap with the edge portions of adjacent side panels such that outermost surfaces of the side panels extend substantially continuously when the panels are operatively disposed at a lateral side of the flat support surface. 
The cover system according to the second aspect may also include retaining devices such as clips operatively associated with the panels for selectively, immovably securing the panels on the vehicle, handles provided with the panels, and seals provided
with the overlapping portions of the panel edges.  Additionally, the lower support may comprise the sealing device according to the first aspect of the invention.
 Such structure according to the second aspect is advantageous because (among other reasons): it provides the cover system with a desirably aerodynamic, aesthetic and smooth outer surface; it increases the effective usable storage space for cargo
on the support surface; and also because it permits reduction of a number of the support posts and post-retaining pockets conventionally used in the cover system, and correspondingly reduces the cost and weight of the system.
 According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a cover system for a substantially flat support surface on a vehicle including stake-supported removable panels, comprising a plurality of stakes include retaining slots adapted to
securely receive vertically extending edges of the removable panels, and fastening devices which are adapted to selectively immovably fix the stakes directly to the vehicle or to a spacing member fixed to the vehicle.  The fastening devices may include
stabilizing pins, flanges, etc. which engage the vehicle or the spacing member, and securing members which may be selectively manipulated by an operator for securing and detaching the stakes to the vehicle or spacing members.
 Such a stake according to the third aspect of the invention is advantageous because (among other reasons): it eliminates the pockets which are conventionally required to receive and retain lower portions of the stakes on the vehicle; it provides
greater design freedom in locating the stakes on the vehicle; and facilitates attachment and detachment of the stakes relative to the system and the vehicle.
 According to a fourth aspect of the invention, the cover system may also include a tarp cover, supporting bows which support the tarp cover when the cover is extended over the flat support surface and include bow ends which are detachably
connected to the upper rail, and a securing mechanism which secures edges of the tarp cover closely adjacent to the bow ends and the upper rail, wherein the securing mechanism is disposed inwardly of the tarp cover.  The securing mechanism may be
operatively connected to one or more of the bows, and the cover system may include a plurality of the securing mechanisms connected to different ones of the bows, as well as a seal extending from the upper rail which engages the edges of the tarp cover
to restrict/prevent water and foreign matter from passing therebetween.
 Such a cover system according to the fourth aspect of the invention is very advantageous because (among other reasons): the bows and the tarp cover are more securely maintained in desired positions on the vehicle, with little movement of same
while the vehicle is traveling in comparison to conventional cover systems; the bows may be located with greater freedom along the upper rail because their locations need not correspond to locations of the supporting stakes as in the conventional
systems; cargo within the cover system is better protected from water and foreign matter because of the seal; the cover is more aerodynamic and aesthetic in appearance than the conventional systems which use elastic straps and ropes to secure the tarp
cover to a vehicle; etc.
 According to a fifth aspect of the invention, the cover system may also include a guide assembly which is operatively connected to the upper rail such that it can be easily moved along the rail when desired by an operator, and which is also
operatively connected to the ends of the supporting bows such that the bows and the tarp cover may be moved together with the guide assembly along the upper rail when desired for covering and exposing the flat support surface of the vehicle.  The guide
assembly and cover system may include various means for facilitating movement of the assembly along the upper rail, such as carriage wheels which engage and roll along the rail, carriage sliders which engage and slide along the rail, an air-assist
mechanism which discharges air between the sliders and opposing surfaces of the rail to reduce sliding friction between the sliders and the opposing surfaces; replaceable plastic members provided with the upper rail to be engaged by the wheels or sliders
of the guide assembly, and which may be easily replaced when they become worn; etc. Additionally, the cover system may include a locking mechanism which locks the guide assembly to the upper rail in an end position of the guide assembly, corresponding to
a fully covering position of the tarp cover, as well as a tensioning mechanism which tensions the tarp cover when it is in its fully covering position, and a seal extending from the upper rail which engages the edges of the tarp cover to restrict/prevent
water and foreign matter from passing therebetween.  The locking and tensioning mechanisms may be combined together, and may be adapted to be actuated by an operator standing adjacent to the vehicle at a level below the tarp cover.
 Such a cover system according to the fifth aspect of the invention is very advantageous because (among other reasons): the tarp cover system may be easily and conveniently moved to a desired position by a person standing on the ground adjacent
to the trailer; cargo within the cover system is better protected from water and foreign matter because of the seal; the cover is more aerodynamic and aesthetic in appearance than the conventional systems which use elastic straps and ropes to secure the
tarp cover to a vehicle; etc.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PRESENTLY CONTEMPLATED EMBODIMENTS
 Overview
 A number of selected illustrative embodiments of the invention will now be described in some detail, with reference to the drawings.  It should be understood that only structures considered necessary for clarifying the present invention are
described herein.  Other conventional structures, and those of ancillary and auxiliary components of the system, are assumed to be known and understood by those skilled in the art.  These illustrative embodiments are removable cover systems for being
mounted on flatbed trailers, other vehicles or the like, and various components of such systems.
 With reference to FIG. 1, there is shown a flatbed trailer 12 equipped with a cover system 10 according to a selected illustrative embodiment of the invention, where the system has been fully installed and deployed on a flatbed trailer 12 to
cover a load carried on the trailer.  While the system 10 may generally include many components which are similar to those of the conventional tarp-and-rack systems, there are many significant differences/improvements in the components of the present
system, and it also includes many new components not found in the conventional systems.  Moreover, unlike in the conventional systems, many of the system components may be readily, manually attached to or removed from the trailer 12 by a user standing at
ground level next to the trailer, and others of which may be easily manipulated by such standing user.
 Generally, the system 10 may include: a plurality of retainer pockets 14 which are fixed in a spaced manner along opposite lateral sides and a rear end of the trailer or to spacers extending from the sides of the trailer; a plurality of stakes
16 having lower ends detachably fitted in the pockets, respectively; a plurality of sidewall panels 18 which extend vertically and have opposite side edges supported in retaining grooves defined in the stakes, such that the panels and stakes form side
(and possibly rear) walls of the cover system 10; a plurality of sealing members 20 extending between lower ends of the panels 18 and the flatbed trailer 12 to prevent water and other foreign matter from entering into a covered space within the cover
system, including when the vehicle is traveling; a plurality of rail sections 22 extending along the opposite sides and possibly the rear end of the trailer above upper edges of the stakes and panels, and secured to upper ends of the stakes 16; a tarp
cover 24 disposed above, and extending between the rails 22; a plurality of bows 25 which support the cover 24 on the rails and which may be removable or movable relative to the system as discussed further below; a front headboard 26 at a front end of
the trailer, and an end cap 28 at a rear end of the trailer above the rear end portions of the rails.  The tarp cover 24 is omitted in FIG. 1 to better show the supporting bows and other components disposed underneath the cover, but the cover is shown in
other drawings including FIGS. 8 and 24-24B.  Also, a conventional bumper bar or rail, such as indicated at 3 in FIG. 21, which may extend fully along each lateral side of the trailer, may be used in conjunction with the seal devices and other components
of the system as discussed herein, although the bumper bar is not necessarily part of the cover system.
 Each of the various components of the present invention are significantly different than (improvements of) the corresponding components in conventional tarp-and-rack type cover systems, and each of the various components provides advantages over
the conventional systems relating to facilitated use by an operator, enhanced seal ability of the system against water and other foreign matter, improved aerodynamics and appearance, enlarged usable space, etc. For example, each of the pockets 14 and the
stakes 16 may be formed of multiple components which are separable or movable relative to each other for facilitating assembly and disassembly of the system by an operator standing on the ground adjacent a vehicle having the cover system disposed
thereon, as more specifically discussed below.  Further, while all of the disclosed components may be combined in a given cover system such as depicted, it is not required that all components be used together.  Several of the components have utility by
themselves and/or with other ones of the components.  Also, modifications and alternative embodiments may be used for the various components as discussed herein.
 Retainer Pockets
 With reference to FIGS. 2A-2B, the retainer pockets 14, according to a first embodiment of the invention, include an inner or base section 30 and an outer or movable section 32 which may be selectively disposed in closed (stake-retaining) or
open positions relative to the base section.  The inner, base section 30 and the movable outer section 32 are collectively described herein as pocket sections 30, 32.  The pocket sections 30, 32 may be formed of an appropriate material(s) such as
aluminum, steel, composites, strong plastics, or combinations of these materials.
 The base section 30 may be an integral, unitary member with a substantially C-shaped profile as viewed from above, as shown in FIG. 2A, although other shapes may be used if desired, e.g., curved, polygonal, etc. The depicted base section of FIG.
2A includes an inner attachment surface 34 which is adapted to be fixed to the trailer bed 11, two spaced apart parallel side walls 36, 37 extending outwardly from opposite ends of the attachment surface, and a pair of spaced apart co-planar spacer walls
38 which extend inwardly from each of the respective side walls parallel to and spaced away from the attachment surface, with a central gap 40 provided between the inner ends of the spacer walls 38, to allow access for mounting bolts.
 The attachment surface 34 of the base section 30 may have one or more mounting holes 42 formed therein, to facilitate attachment to side edges of the trailer bed 11 using one or more bolts 43, as shown in FIG. 7A.  A space 45 may be defined
within the base member 30, between the spacer walls 38 and the attachment surface 34, which is useful for disposition and manipulation of the bolts 43, keeps the bolt heads separated from a stake 16 supported in the retaining pocket 14, etc. The lower
potion of the stake may snugly fit in an outer portion of the pocket outward of the walls 38, and thus does not occupy the entire pocket.  The spacer walls 38 could be omitted if desired, such as for example where the base section 30 is welded to the
side edge of the trailer, or in the embodiment of FIGS. 6A-6B where the base member 30 is integrally formed as part of the trailer bed 11.  Further, as an alternative structure, the walls 38 may be formed together with each other as a single continuous
wall parallel to the attachment surface 34, such as wall 38' in the embodiment of FIG. 2D.  Such a single wall may have openings formed therein which align with the openings 42 but are sufficiently larger in diameter than the openings 42 so that a bolt
and a socket for manipulating the bolt may pass through the larger openings when bolt is to be fastened or loosened relative to the opening 42.
 The movable section 32 may be a relatively shallow member, with a cross-sectional C-shape as shown in FIG. 2A, including an outer wall 44 which forms the outermost surface of the retaining pocket when in the closed position, and a pair of
spaced-apart side walls 46, 47 extending transversely inwardly from opposed ends of the outer wall 44.  The movable section 32 may be configured and dimensioned so that the side walls 46, 47 thereof may extend either inside or outside of the base section
30 in the closed position, as noted.
 Referring now to FIGS. 2B-2D, the pocket sections 30, 32 may be connected via a hinge 35 extending horizontally along a bottom, inner edge of the movable section 32 and across a bottom surface of the base section 30, such that the movable
section 32 may be pivoted relative to the base section 30 to establish the open and closed positions of the pocket 14.
 It is not essential that the pocket sections 30, 32 have the specific shapes and the hinged configuration shown in FIGS. 2B-2D, rather, it is only essential that the retaining pocket is selectively and adjustably disposable in open and closed
positions.  For example, the hinge 35 may be disposed vertically between the pocket sections 30, 32 as shown in FIG. 3A, the bottom wall of the movable section 32 may be angled as shown in FIG. 3B, the sections may be completely separable without a hinge
connection as shown in FIGS. 3C, 3D, or the retainer pocket may have a curved, rounded, polygonal, or other shape, etc.
 The multi-part retaining pocket 14 is an important aspect of the present invention, and represents a significant improvement over conventional pockets of known covering systems of this type.  The conventional retainer pockets are very typically
one-piece, rectangular, tubular members made of metal such as aluminum or steel, and are welded to the longitudinal sides of the flatbed trailer in spaced disposition, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 22 of the drawings.  Because of such conventional
construction, the stakes supported thereby must be vertically lifted to be removed from the pockets, again, typically by a person standing in the flatbed trailer.
 Due to the multiple-section construction of the retaining pocket 14 according to the invention, however, it becomes possible for a person standing on the ground adjacent to the flatbed trailer to conveniently remove the stakes from the retaining
pockets, as discussed further below.
 The inner or base section 30 is fixed to a side portion of the flatbed trailer 12 in an appropriate manner, such as welding or via threaded bolts or other fasteners.  The base section 30 may be an integral, unitary member with a substantially
C-shaped cross section, as shown, although other shapes may be used if desired, e.g., curved, polygonal, etc.
 Referring now to FIGS. 6A-6B, an alternate embodiment of a base section is shown at 230, and in this embodiment, the base section is integrally affixed to, and made part of a side edge reinforcement 200 which is an integral side portion of the
trailer flat bed 11.
 In the embodiment of FIGS. 6A-6B, the side edges of the trailer bed 11 have a plurality of pairs of substantially vertical spaced-apart plates 236, 237 affixed thereto and extending outwardly therefrom.  Each of the plates 236, 237 includes a
proximal end 238 which is operatively attached to one of the side edges of the trailer bed 11, and a distal end 239 spaced outwardly from the proximal end.  An open space 240 is formed in the fixed pocket section 230 between the distal ends 239 of
adjacent plates 236, 237 for receiving a movable pocket section therein, such as the movable pocket section 32 of FIG. 2A.  Each pair of adjacent plates 236, 237 is adapted to cooperate with a movable pocket section, such as the section 32, to define a
stake-receiving pocket 14.
 Although omitted from FIGS. 6A-6B for purposes of illustration, it will further be understood that the fixed pocket sections 230 of the embodiment shown in FIGS. 6A-6B may also be provided with panel support brackets of the type shown in FIGS.
2B and 5, and as further discussed herein, if desired.
 As seen in FIG. 2C, the movable section 32 may, optionally, include a lower wall 48 extending between end edges of the side walls, and the hinge 35 may be connected to the lower wall and/or to the side walls.  Again, however, the shapes of the
base and movable sections 30, 32 can be variously modified as desired, the hinge 35 can be omitted or located differently, etc., as long as the base section 30 and the outer section 32 are movable relative to one another, to establish the open and closed
positions of the retaining pocket 14.
 Pocket Latch
 A fastener such as fastener 49 shown in FIG. 3E or another mechanism may be used for securely maintaining the movable section 32 in the closed position.  For example, according to embodiments of the present invention, a pocket latch 55, 155 such
as shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, or the latch 55' shown in FIG. 2D may be used.  The pocket latch 55 of FIG. 7A includes a pin 100 which may be inserted through respective openings 102, 104 (FIG. 2A) formed in the base and movable sections 30, 32,
respectively, of the retaining pocket 14.  The pin 100 may be substantially L-shaped, as depicted, such that the longer portion thereof may be extended through the openings 102, 104 to maintain the pocket in the closed position thereof.  Optionally, the
pin 100 may include a spring-loaded detent ball inside of a distal end thereof, to temporarily retain the pin in place in the retaining pocket 14 when installed therein.  The pin 100 may be removed as needed, when the trailer 12 is stationary, to permit
the movable section 32 to be moved to establish the open position of the pocket 14.  The shorter portion of the pin 100 may extend at a right angle to the longer portion, and can function as a handle for gripping and manipulating the pin.
 As shown in FIGS. 4A and 7A, and as discussed further below, an outer section 60 of the stake 16 may also include openings 74 through which the pin 100 may be extended, to secure the stake 16 in place in the closed pocket 14.  Further, as
depicted a stopper 106 may optionally be provided near the pocket, e.g., extending from an outer protective rail 3 to prevent the pin 100 from being unintentionally displaced from the openings 102, 104, e.g., when the trailer is moving.  Particularly,
the stopper 106 is disposed at a level below the openings 102, 104 by a distance less than the length of the shorter portion of the pin 100.
 For insertion into the openings, the pin 100 is manipulated such that the shorter portion thereof is facing toward the trailer above the stopper 106, and after insertion, the shorter portion is rotated downwardly, such that it will contact the
stopper 106 if the pin starts to move out of the openings, and will be prevented from further movement in such direction by the stopper.  Also, the force of gravity will normally maintain the shorter portion of the pin 100 pointing downwardly.
 With reference to FIGS. 7B, 7C there is shown another alternative embodiment of a pocket latch 155 according to the invention.  In this embodiment, the pocket latch 155 includes a spring-biased locking member 108 mounted to the base member 30 at
one side of the pocket 14.  The locking member 108 includes an engaging member 110 which may be extended through openings 111 formed in the side walls of the base and movable sections of the pocket, respectively, when the pocket is in its closed
position, and a handle 112 which can be manipulated to lock the engaging member 110 in the latched position thereof, or to release the engaging member from the movable member 32.
 Again, a stopper, such as the stopper 106 in the first embodiment of the locking mechanism, may optionally be provided to operatively engage the handle 112 to prevent unwanted movement thereof as in the first embodiment, or alternatively, an
internal spring may be provided to urge the engaging member 110 into the openings 111 of the pocket 14.
 With reference to FIG. 2D, the latch 55' may include a rotatable shaft provided with the pocket base portion 30 having one or two latch arms 56 which operatively engage with catches 56' formed with the pocket outer portion 32 to maintain the
pocket in a closed position.  The rotatable shaft may be spring-biased or the like so that it is normally urged to a latched position thereof, and may include a free end which functions as a handle for manipulation by an operator.
 Stakes
 With reference to FIGS. 4A and 4B, there is shown a stake 16 according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention, and this stake includes an inner section 58 and an outer section 60 which are selectively connectable together, and which
cooperate when assembled to define a pair of opposed vertical grooves 62 therebetween (FIG. 4B) along opposite sides of the stake 16.  The grooves 62 function to receive and retain vertical side edges of two adjacent panels 18 therein, when the stake is
disposed in the retaining pocket 14 on the trailer.
 The stakes 16 can be made from any appropriate material, however, aluminum or aluminum alloys are well-suited for the application.  The stakes 16 may be formed by extrusion.  Each stake 16 may be an elongated member with a uniform
cross-sectional shape, adapted to have a lower portion thereof removably disposed in one of the retaining pockets 14.
 As depicted, the inner section 58 of the stake 16 may be a tubular member having a cross-section that is substantially rectangular with a shallow central recess 59 formed in one surface thereof, however other cross-sectional shapes such as
round, curved, polygonal, triangular, etc. could be used if desired.
 The outer section 60 of the stake 16 may include a substantially flat elongate plate 63 with a pair of spaced-apart ribs 64 projecting transversely from one face thereof, such that outer edges of the ribs 64 engage the central recess 59 of the
inner stake section 58 to define the grooves 62, as depicted in FIG. 4B.  The side edges of the recess 59 engage the edges of the ribs 64 to help maintain alignment of the inner and outer stake sections 58, 60.
 The outer stake section 60 may be provided with one or more upwardly extending hooks 66 extending outwardly from the plate 63 between the ribs 64, and these hooks may be inserted in an appropriate opening 68 formed in the inner section, to
connect the inner and outer sections 58, 60 together.  The height of the hook(s) 66 may be greater than that of the opening 68, such that the outer section 60 must be disposed at an angle in relation to the inner section 58 for insertion and removal of
the hook(s), and when the inner and outer sections are disposed parallel to one another, the hook(s) extend within the hollow of the inner section above the opening 68, to operatively connect the outer section to the inner section.
 Also, a projection 70 may be provided on a lower portion of the outer section 60 for preventing lateral movement of the inner and outer sections 58, 60 relative to each other, and relative to the retaining pocket 14 in which a lower end of the
stake 16 is disposed.  The projection 70 is snugly received by a corresponding opening 72 provided in a lower portion of the inner section.
 Aligned openings 74 may be provided in the ribs 64 of the outer section, which receive a pin 100 of the pocket latch 55 therethrough, so that the stake 16 is engaged by the pocket latch, such as shown in FIGS. 5 and 7A, and as previously
discussed.  Further, a fixed projection 70' may be provided with the base 30 of the pocket which extends through a corresponding opening (not shown) formed in the inner section 58 of the stake when the inner section is disposed in the pocket, as shown in
FIG. 2D, whereby the stake is substantially prevented from moving relative to the pocket during operative use of the cover system, e.g., when a vehicle having the cover system thereon is traveling.
 The shape of the outer section 60 of the stake 16 may be modified from that shown in the drawings, if desired, so that the outer section may also be engaged by the engaging member 110 of the pocket latch 155 in the second embodiment thereof.
 As shown in FIGS. 13A-13B, the stakes 16 may also include caps 73, formed of plastic or other appropriate material, and fitted in the opposite ends of the inner section 58.  The caps 73, where used, provide multiple functions, including: sealing
the hollow interior of the inner section; receiving the ends of the hooks 66 against the interior thereof to maintain the inner and outer sections in tightly engaged relationship, while preventing the hooks 66 from directly engaging the inner section 58
(which could cause undesirable wearing of the inner and outer sections); guiding portions of a rail locking mechanism, as discussed further below; preventing metal components of the system from contacting each other; etc. The caps 73 are relatively
inexpensive, and may be easily replaced when worn or desired.
 The multi-section stake 16 is also an important aspect of the system 10 according to the present invention, representing another significant change from conventional cover systems of this type, in that the multiple-section construction (in
combination with the retaining pocket of the invention) permits the stakes 16 and the panels 18 to be conveniently installed and removed by a person standing at ground level adjacent to the trailer.
 While an embodiment of the stake 16 is described above, the invention is not limited to the specifics of such embodiment.  For example, the outer section may be configured as a channel-shaped member 60' with a substantially U-shaped cross
section as shown in FIG. 4C.  Such member may be readily formed by pressing a piece of flat stock, for example, and functions essentially the same as the outer section 60 in FIG. 4A.  Further, instead of the hooks 66 in FIG. 4A, the inner and outer
sections of the stake may be connected using a movable connecting member 66' as shown in FIG. 4D.  The member 66' extends through and is pivotally connected to the outer section 60', with a short hooked end on one side of the pivot and a longer handle on
the other side of the pivot.  For attaching the outer section to the inner section, the handle is pivoted away from the outer section, the hooked end is inserted in the opening 68, and the handle is rotated back toward the outer section such that the
hooked end is rotated upward to engage the stake inner section.  The handle conveniently fits in the central channel of the U-shaped outer section when the stake sections are connected together.
 With, reference to FIGS. 3E, 3F there is shown a modified embodiment of the present invention wherein a pocket such as that of FIG. 3D is modified in cooperation with a modification of a multi-part stake such as shown in FIG. 4A or 4B, such that
the outer wall 44' of the pocket remains connected to the outer portion 60'' of the stake via fastener 49 which extends through a circular opening defined in the outer wall and an elongate opening formed in the outer portion, but can be moved/slid
relative to the pocket base section 30' and the outer portion 60'' of the stake for convenience in attaching and detaching the outer wall 44' and the outer portion 60'' relative to the system through appropriate manipulation of the fastener 49 and the
outer wall 44''.  As shown, the outer wall 44' is slidably connected to the base section 30' in guillotine fashion via projections 44'' which slide in channels 30'' formed in lateral walls of the base.  Further, the projections 44'' do not extend the
full length of the outer wall, but include gaps therealong, while similarly the channels 30'' include intermediate openings formed in the outer faces thereof which operatively cooperate with the projections to permit removal of the outer wall 44' from
the base without sliding the outer wall fully above the base.  Specifically, when the fastener 49 is tightened the outer wall 44'' and the stake outer portion 60'' are fixed immovably together, such as when the system is in its operative, traveling
state.  However, when the fastener is loosened somewhat but continues to connect the outer wall 44' and the stake outer portion 60'', the outer wall can be slid upward relative to the stake outer portion due to the elongate shape of the opening formed in
the outer wall and through which the fastener extends.  When the outer wall is slid upwardly to a point where the projections 44'' align with the gaps in the channels 30'', the outer wall 44' can be moved outwardly apart from the base 30', together with
the stake outer portion 60'' connected thereto, by a person standing on the ground next to the system.  Once the stake outer portion is removed, the stake base remains on the vehicle, but panels 18 can be moved relative thereto for being removed. 
Particularly, when the stake outer portion 60' is removed, there will be a gap between the edges of the two panels that had been retained by the stake, such that one of the panels may be slid over into the gap (thereby freeing the opposite edge of the
panel retained by an adjacent stake) and the panel may then be removed, after which the other panel may similarly be removed.  The lower end of the pocket may be closed by a plate 51, which functions as a stop for the lower end of the stake inserted in
the pocket, and opening or recess 51' may be formed in the outer portion of the plate 51 for facilitating manipulation of the pocket outer wall 44'', e.g., an operator may insert a finger into the opening 51' and raise the finger, thereby also raising
the outer wall 44'.  This modification is desirable because, for example, the outer wall 44' remains conveniently connected to the stake outer portion 60'' at all times via the simple fastener, so that the components do not become misplaced.
 Pocketless Stakes
 While the stakes 16 may be advantageously used together with the pockets 14 as discussed above, according to another modification of the present invention the stakes may alternatively be connected directly to the trailer 12 or to spacers
connected to the trailer, such as shown in FIGS. 4F, 4G.
 Referring to FIG. 4F, there is shown one embodiment of a pocketless stake according to the present invention.  In this embodiment, a lower part of the inner portion 58 of the stake may be selectively connected to the side of the trailer bed 11
or, as depicted, to a spacer 8' extending outwardly from the side of the trailer using a fastener 168 which may be inserted through openings formed in the stake inner portion and the spacer and appropriately secured.  For example, the fastener may have a
threaded end which is screwed into threads formed in the spacer opening or to a threaded nut provided on an inner face of the spacer.  As another example, the fastener may be a rotatable member having a T-shaped inner end such that it may be inserted
through an elongate opening in the spacer when oriented in one direction, and then when the fastener is rotated 90.degree.  the T-shaped end securely engages the inner surface of the spacer.  For additional stability and reliability of the connection
between the stake and the spacer, a plurality of fasteners 168 may be used, or as depicted one or more projecting members 169 may be provided on the inner portion 58 of the stake which are received in additional opening(s) formed in the spacer 8'.  When
the projections 169 are disposed in the openings they prevent the stake inner portion 58 from rotating or otherwise moving relative to the spacer 8'.  Of course, the projection(s) could alternatively be provided on the spacer 8', while the receiving
openings are formed in the stake inner portion.  If the outer portion 60 of the stake is formed separate from the inner portion 58, the outer portion 60 would connect to inner portion in a manner such as discussed above relative to FIGS. 4A, 4B, 4D, for
example, while if the outer portion of the stake 60 remains connected to the inner portion such as in FIG. 4C above, the outer portion 60 may be provided starting above the lower part of the inner portion that is connected to the spacer.
 Referring to FIG. 4G, another embodiment of a pocketless stake according to the present invention is similar to the embodiment of FIG. 4F except that: a fastener 168' is T-shaped at opposite ends thereof; an oblong opening 8'' is formed in the
member 8' which permits the inner T-shaped end of fastener 168' to pass there through when end is aligned with the opening; and a flanged bracket 170 is provided in conjunction with the fastener 168, rather than the projections 169.  The fastener 168'
can be selectively secured to member 8' by inserting its inner T-shaped end into the slot 8'' and then rotating the fastener so that the end is no longer aligned with the opening.  An appropriate device such as a latch (not shown) may be provided to
maintain the fastener in its locked position.  The flanged bracket 170 may be connected to the stake inner portion 58 at appropriate positions such that one or two flange(s) 170' thereof operatively engage upper and/or lower surfaces of the sides of
trailer or a spacer 8' extending from the trailer.  Similar to the projection(s) 169, the flange(s) 170' prevent the stake inner portion 58 from rotating or otherwise moving relative to the trailer or spacer.  Of course, the threaded fastener 168 could
be used in the embodiment of FIG. 4G.
 Sidewall Panels
 As previously noted, the stakes 16 are provided to support and interconnect a plurality of panels 18.  The panels 18 are generally rectangular in shape, and may be made from any flat rigid material including plywood, fiberglass, polymers, foams,
sheet metal, composites, or any combination of these.  The panels 18 are made in a suitable thickness to fit snugly into the vertical grooves 62 of the stakes 16.  If constructed of lightweight materials, such as open-celled foam with inner and outer
aluminum skin bonded thereon, the panels 18 are easier to manipulate and are more fuel-efficient to use.  Alternatively, the panels could be formed using a rigid outer frame formed of aluminum, plastic or other suitable material, and a lightweight
covering material such as vinyl appropriately secured to the frame to form a substantially smooth/flush outer surface with the frame.  Such a construction would desirably reduce the weight of the system, and yet have a suitable appearance similar to the
panels formed of rigid materials.
 The height of the panels 18 may be somewhat greater than the width thereof, although this is not required.  Further, the panels 18 may have different lengths or other dimensions if desired, but if the panels have identical sizes, this allows for
interchangeability and standardization of manufacture.  Optionally, the panels 18 may be provided with handles in appropriate locations for being easily grasped by an operator, and where used, such handles may be provided, for example, as straps or
projections attached to the panels, or openings formed in the panels to receive a hand of a user therein.  As another optional feature, an upper horizontal edge of each of the panels 18 may be reinforced with a frame or reinforcement member 19 extending
over the panel on three or four sides thereof, as shown in FIG. 15A.
 According to an important aspect of the inventive cover system 10, when the system hereof is assembled on a truck trailer 12, the panels 18, as supported by the stakes 16 and retaining pockets 14, are disposed away from the trailer 11 at the
outside of the retaining pockets 14, such that the outer surfaces of the panels 18 are substantially flush with the outer surfaces of the stakes 16, as shown in FIGS. 11A-11C, and as discussed further below.  This presents a substantially smooth and
aerodynamic exterior trailer surface, for improved efficiency and fuel economy during over-the-road travel of the trailer 12.
 Correspondingly, it is desirable to provide some additional support for the bottom edges of the panels 18 besides the upper edges of the pocket sidewalls 36, 37, which have a relatively small surface area.  For such purpose, as shown in FIGS. 2B
and 5, a pair of integral support brackets 50 may be provided longitudinally extending from, and attached to the side walls 36, 37 of the retaining pockets 14.  As depicted, the brackets 50 may be attached between sides of the trailer 12 and pocket side
walls, e.g., via welding.  The brackets 50 include flat upper surfaces 52 on outer portions thereof, for supportively contacting lower edges of the panels 18, and inner portions 54 which slope downwardly toward the trailer so as to avoid interference
with the seal members 20 (discussed further below).
 The brackets 50 may be constructed other than shown.  For example, they could be formed integrally with the retaining pockets, they could have a different shape or size from that depicted, etc.
 As an alternative or additional support for the panels 18, an outer protective bumper rail 3 shown in FIG. 10 corresponding to the conventional bumper rail 3 in FIG. 2 may, optionally, be disposed such that its upper surface is at a level and
disposition to support the bottom edges of the panels.  As an alternative to disposing the bumper rail 3 at an appropriate level, spacers could be provided between the upper surface of the bumper rail 3 and the lower surfaces of the panels 18 so that the
panels are supported at an appropriate level.  This may be appropriate for an existing trailer being fitted with components of a cover system according to the present invention.  The bumper rail 3 may extend continuously along substantially the full
longitudinal length of the trailer 12, or could be provided in sections between the pockets 14.
 Method of Disassembling Stakes and Panels
 As previously discussed, in prior art cover systems, conventional stakes make it difficult to manually install and remove the stakes and the associated panels relative to a flatbed trailer or the like.  In contrast, with the stake 16 and
retaining pocket 14 of the present invention, the following convenient procedure may be used for removing the stakes and panels from a trailer.
 Initially, the truck is parked in a secure location, such as adjacent a loading dock.  Then, the pocket latch 55 or 155 is released, and the movable section 32 of the retaining pocket 14 is manipulated to move it to the open position thereof. 
The outer section 60 of the stake 16 is then removed or detached from the inner section 58 thereof, which creates a gap between opposing vertical edges of a pair of the panels 18, corresponding to the space between the ribs 64 of the outer section 60.
 One of the exposed panels 18 may then be removed by sliding or displacing it longitudinally to close the gap until it approaches or abuttingly contacts an edge of the adjacent panel 18.  This longitudinal movement of the panel 18 removes the
opposite vertical edge of the displaced panel from a recess 62 of an associated stake, whereupon the displaced panel is no longer secured by any post, and can be manually pulled off or down from the trailer.
 The other panel can then be removed in like fashion, and a similar process can be applied for removing other stakes and panels of the system, as desired, to access the contents of the trailer.  For mounting the stakes and panels to the trailer,
a reverse process is applied.
 Although the multi-section stake and the multi-section retaining pocket of the invention function very advantageously in combination, as discussed above, the two part stake could (of course) be used together with a conventional, non-moving
pocket.  In such case, it may be necessary to lift the lower portion of the stake out of the retaining pocket before the sections of the stake could be separated.  In such use, the stake would be disposed in the pocket such that the panel-receiving
recesses face outwardly of the trailer, and would permit panels to be installed on and removed from the system by a person standing on the ground next to the trailer.  For example, once the outer section of the stake is separated and removed from the
inner section, again, a gap would be defined between the two panels that were supported by the stake, one of the panels could be slid over into the gap such that the opposite side edge of the panel is released from the adjacent stake, and then the panel
could then be removed from the system.  Such procedure could be reversed for installing a panel to the system.  Similarly, a one-piece stake could, if desired, be used with the inventive pocket 14 according to the invention.
 Again, another important aspect of the invention is the disposition of the panels 18 such that the outer surfaces thereof are disposed away from the trailer at the outside of the retaining pocket, and substantially flush with the outermost
surfaces of the stakes, as shown in FIGS. 11A-11C.  In this arrangement, the stakes project outwardly of the panels only by the width of the outer wall 60 thereof.  This advantageously provides the cover system with a relatively smooth and aerodynamic
outer surface, unlike the conventional systems where the stakes project significantly outwardly from the panels.  As a result, the system according to the present invention improves aerodynamic characteristics and improves aesthetic appearance of the
trailer.
 Further, the outward disposition of the panels 18 in the present invention effectively creates additional covered cargo storage space in comparison to conventional systems.  For example, in comparison to conventional systems, in which the panels
are supported on or directly adjacent to the trailer, the panels of the present invention may be spaced outwardly from the trailer by approximately two-three inches while still meeting the same government regulations on vehicle width as the conventional
systems.  For a trailer which is forty feet long and a cover system which is six feet high, this effectively creates additional usable storage space within the trailer, e.g., 40-80 cubic feet, as compared to a conventional cover system.
 Still further, this reduces the possibility of interference between the panels and cargo support straps and chains, which are typically anchored below the trailer bed, and extend around and over the edge of the trailer bed to secure the cargo.
 At the junctions between the two sides of the trailer and the rear end of the trailer, it is possible to use a corner stake 75 which includes a pair of panel-receiving recesses extending at a right angle to each other, i.e., one recess facing
parallel to the side of the trailer and the other recess facing parallel to the rear of the trailer.  A cross section of such a corner stake 75 is shown in FIG. 4E.  The lower portion of the stake 75, that fits in the retainer pocket, may have a
different shape from that in FIG. 4E, e.g., the section of the stake defining the recess facing parallel to the side of trailer could be eliminated, so that the lower portion fits in a retaining pocket 14 shaped the same as the other pockets.  Generally,
it is desirable that a stake at the rear end/corner of the trailer may have enhanced strength and rigidity as compared to other stakes of the system 10 because the end/corner stake will normally be supporting a larger load than the other stakes.  In
conventional systems which use the same stakes for all positions on the trailer, the stake at the rear end of the trailer tends to be bent and lean forwardly over time due to the larger load it supports.
 Seal Member
 With reference to FIGS. 1 and 8-11C, the seal members 20 of the system 10 are configured and arranged to seal the spaces or openings defined between the lower edge portions of the panels 18 and the trailer bed 11.  Sealing of this area is
important, given that the panels 18 may be disposed at the outside of the retainer pockets 14, and significantly spaced away from the trailer, as discussed above.  Although only a thin section of a seal 20 is shown in FIG. 9 for simplicity of
illustration, the seal members 20 may be approximately as long as the panels 18, and one seal member may be disposed along the entire length of the bottom edge of each panel, or alternatively the seal members may be as long as several panels together or
may extend substantially the full length of the trailer as discussed below.  Thus, the sealing members 20 may extend substantially completely around the two sides and the rear of the trailer, although there may be a small gap at a central portion of each
stake 16, corresponding to the disposition of the panels.
 Referring now to FIGS. 8-10, it will be seen that the seal member 20 may include a panel-engaging portion 78 including two spaced-apart vertical flanges 76, 77 interconnected by a bridge portion 79, and first and second trailer-engaging portions
80, 81.  As shown, the first trailer-engaging portion 80 may be adapted to engage the upper surface of the trailer bed 11, while the second trailer-engaging portion 81 may be adapted to extend diagonally downward from the first member to abuttingly
contact the side surface of the trailer bed.  This is advantageous for forming an effective seal against water, dirt and other foreign matter.
 Of course, the seal member 20 may include various modifications.  For example, while two of the flexible portions 80, 81 are shown, the seal member 20 may include only one of the flexible portions or more than two of the flexible portions.  As
another example, the panel-engaging portion 78 may be structured to fit over the upper edge of the conventional bumper rail 3 provided at the side of a trailer rather than being fitted to the bottom edge of the panel 18, such that the lower surface of
the panel would simply rest on the upper surface of the portion 78 such as shown in FIG. 9A.  Depending on the level of the upper surface of the bumper rail, e.g., if it is below the level of the flat support surface of the trailer where the lower edge
of the panel should be disposed, spacer(s) 79' may be disposed between the bumper rail and the engaging portion 78 of the seal member 20 so that the seal member will be at the appropriate height for supporting the panel.  Indicated at 80' is an optional
recess formed in the upper surface of the seal member and which would be engaged by the lower edge of a panel supported on the seal member.  As another possibility, the portion 78 may extend both upwardly and downwardly so as to be fitted over both the
upper edge of the bumper rail and over the lower edge of the panel as shown in FIG. 9B.  Still further, the seal member could be simply formed as continuous flat or substantially flat member wide enough to extend between the edge of the trailer and the
lower portion of the panel(s), and which may have one edge or portion attached to the lower portion of the panel(s) or to the edge of the trailer using appropriate fastening means such as screw, adhesive, etc., and another portion sealingly engaging the
trailer or the lower portion of the panel.
 Such a modification is shown in FIG. 9C wherein a seal 20' is provided as a single length of rubber or other appropriate elastomeric/flexible material with an enlarged edge, and a frame 19' for a panel is formed with a slot shaped to slidably
and securely receive the enlarged edge of the seal 20' therein.  In use, the free end of the seal 20' would engage the side or flat upper surface of the trailer.  If the seal member 20' becomes damaged, it can easily be removed and replaced with a new
seal member.  Also as shown, the panel frame 19' may include identical slots on the opposite sides thereof and a central circular shaped slot.  Forming the seal-receiving slot on both sides provides some flexibility for reversing the panel frame if one
of the slot becomes damaged, and if the panel frame 19' is also provided along the top edge of the panel and if an upper rail 22 according to the invention is not used, another seal member 20' may be secured to the upper panel frame 19' such that it
projects outwardly to engage the tarp and provide a seal which restricts passage of water and other foreign matter between the panel and the tarp.  The central circular shaped slot may be used to facilitate screw assembly of the panel frame 19' to a
panel 18, as an alternative to riveting, adhesive bonding, etc.
 The seal 20 is also an important aspect of the system 10 according to the present invention, including the illustrative embodiments.  It advantageously eliminates or at least minimizes gaps though which water and other foreign matter may enter
into the storage space within the cover system.  The seal member 20 is especially important when considered together with the outwardly spaced disposition of the panels 18 relative to the trailer 12 in the depicted embodiments, because a substantial gap
is formed laterally between the lower end of the panels and the trailer.  The seal member 20, including the flexible portions 80, 81, also helps to maintain its sealing function during movement of the trailer, while accommodating flexing movement of the
trailer bed 11.
 The seal member 20 can be permanently bonded or attached to the panel 18 or to the bumper rail 3, e.g., using adhesive or fasteners, to reduce the possibility of the seal detaching therefrom during handling or transit, or otherwise becoming
lost.  However, the seal member 20 could alternatively be detachably connected to the panels or the bumper rail, if desired, e.g., via friction or snap fit of the panel-engaging portion 78 around the bottom edge of the panel or the upper edge of the
bumper rail.
 The panel-engaging portion 78 may include a plastic or metal insert (not shown) made of a harder material than the flexible portions 80, 81 and the rest of the seal 20.  The sealing member, particularly the flexible portions 80, 81 can be made
from a rubber material, a strong reinforced silicone elastomer, or other water-resistant elastomeric or flexible material.  While other materials could be used if desired, flexible materials such as rubber and elastomers provide excellent sealing
characteristics, and the seal member 20 cooperates well with any load securing straps or chains that may be needed to pass between the flatbed and the seal member.
 While embodiments of the seal member 20 are discussed above, it will be understood that variations may be made thereto.  For example, the particular shape of the seal member 20 may be modified as desired, as long as the sealing function is
maintained, e.g., the panel-engaging portion 78 may be other than U-shaped in section, the trailer-engaging portion 81 could be made in a different size and/or shape than the portion 80, one or any other number of trailer-engaging portions could be used
instead of two, etc.
 As another possible modification, a conventional bumper rail 3 could be modified to include a slit or recess which is shaped to receive and retain an edge of an elongate flexible seal member such that the seal member extends away from the bumper
rail and engages the upper and/or side surfaces of the trailer to seal the space between the spaces defined between the trailer and the lower portions of the panels.  Similarly, an elongate extrusion of metal such as aluminum or an appropriate plastic
could be formed including a slit or recess, the extrusion could be secured to the trailer, e.g., along the edge of the trailer bed, and an edge of an elongate flexible seal member could be received/retained in the slit such that the seal member extends
away from the trailer and engages the lower portions of the panels and/or the bumper rail to seal the space between the spaces defined between the trailer and the lower portions of the panels.  Still further, such a modified bumper rail, such extrusions,
and such seal members could be used in combination as multiple seals for sealing the spaces between the trailer and the lower ends of the panels.  In such a combination the seal members may each fully cover the spaces between the trailer and the lower
portions of the panels, or each of the seal members may only partially cover the spaces and engage each other intermediately of the spaces such that the combination of seal members fully covers the spaces between the trailer and the lower portions of the
panels.
 While the seal member 20 is advantageously used as part of the covering system 10 according to the depicted embodiment of the present invention, the seal member also has substantial utility by itself, e.g., it may be retrofitted as a seal member
for conventional tarp-and-rack cover systems.  As in the depicted system 10, the seal member could be operatively engaged to the lower portions of the panels in the conventional systems, and/or to the upper portions of the bumper bars at the sides of the
conventional trailers, for providing a sealing function between the panels and the trailer on which the conventional cover system is disposed.  Again, one major drawback of conventional systems is that gaps are formed between the panels and the trailer
by the curvature of the trailer bed and other factors, and the seal member according to the present invention is very effective to cover/seal such gaps.
 Moreover, if the seal member is to be supported on the bumper bars of the conventional trailers, it is possible to very simply increase the effective storage space within the conventional cover systems.  Particularly, the conventional cover
systems have oriented the conventional support stakes 4 such that the panel receiving recesses 6 face inwardly toward the trailer 1 such that the panels are supported on the edge of the trailer as discussed above with reference to FIG. 22.  However, if
the conventional system is retrofitted with the sealing member 20 of the present invention and the sealing member is supported on the upper portion of the bumper bar 3, for example, the conventional stake 4 may be rotated 180.degree.  from the normal
disposition such that the recesses 6 are disposed outwardly away from the trailer 1.  In this case, the lateral width of the storage space within the cover system is effectively increased by the width of the stake 4 on both sides of the trailer, which is
substantial as discussed above.  Also, in such case the conventional system will have improved aerodynamic outer shape and will be sealed against water and other foreign matter.
 With reference to FIGS. 4H, 4I, there is shown some possible modifications to a conventional stake 4' and a conventional pocket 2 which facilitate and improves the use of same with a sealing member (not shown in FIGS. 4H, 4I) according to the
present invention.  According to such modifications, a retainer 53 may be connected within the pocket 2 to effectively reduce the width of the pocket opening and to provide a bottom stop for engaging a lower surface of the stake 4', and an optional wedge
57 may be secured to a lower surface of the stake 4' on a side opposite to panel-receiving channels which operatively, securely engages the retainer 53 when the lower end of the stake is inserted in the pocket 2.  An upper end of the retainer 53 may be
connected to an inner surface of the pocket via welding, bolts, or other appropriate means, a middle portion of the retainer may angle outwardly of the trailer bed 11, and the lower end of the retainer may be bent at an angle of approximately 90.degree. 
to close off part of the lower opening of the pocket.  The wedge 57 may simply be a plate of metal, rigid plastic or other material that is connected via welding, adhesive bonding, bolting, or other appropriate means.  With use of the retainer 53, with
or without the optional wedge 57, the lower portion of the stake is tightly and stably supported in an outer portion of the conventional pocket 2, again, such that the panel--receiving recesses 6 of the stake are disposed away from the trailer bed 11,
and such that the stake does not move/rattle within the pocket when the trailer is moving.  In this modification, the outer surface of the stake 4' may extend outwardly beyond the outer surface of the pocket 2, such that the outer surface of stake is not
flush with the outer surface of the pocket, but most of the advantages of the present invention as discussed above are still achieved.  In this modification of the invention, again, a conventional bumper bar 3 may be fixed to the outer surface of the
pocket 2, such as shown in FIG. 4I, and a seal member according to the invention may be supported on the upper edge of the bumper bar.  Alternatively, the bumper bar 3 may be provided in sections and fixed between adjacent ones of the pockets 2 such that
the bumper bar is flush with the outer surfaces of the pockets, and the seal member may be correspondingly provided in sections supported on the sections of the bumper bar, respectively.
 As other possible modifications to the conventional stake and pocket, according to the present invention the stake and/or pocket may be formed with a reduced width such that the stake has a uniform shape along its full length and a lower portion
of the stake may be inserted in the in the pocket without having to be cut/machined.  This is very desirable because the stakes can be simply formed through extrusion (as is normal with an aluminum stake), and without labor-intensive operations of
cutting/machining the lower portion of the stake to fit into the pocket.  A cover plate may be provided at the lower end of the pocket as a stop for the lower end of the stake.  Panels retained by the stake may have their lower surfaces supported on the
upper surfaces of the pockets, by extensions such as those shown at 52 in FIG. 2B, and/or by a bumper bar 3 and (again) seal members according to the present invention may be used in association with the panels.  In this modification, the lower portion
of the stake need not occupy the entire space within the conventional pocket, e.g., a retainer such as 53 may be provided with the pocket to snugly retain the lower end of the post therein.
 As discussed above, a corner stake disposed at a rear end of the trailer should have enhanced strength/rigidity because it supports a larger load than the other stakes, but this may be accomplished while still reducing a width of the stake.  For
example, the rear corner stake could be provided with two openings to receive/support the ends of two bows, rather than with a single opening to receive/support a single bow end, such as shown in FIG. 4J.  The stakes in FIGS. 4H, 4J may have the same
reduced width, and be supported in similar modified pockets.
 According to still another possibility according to the present invention, multiple different types of stakes may be used together for supporting panels at the side of a trailer, such as shown in FIG. 4K.  In the depicted arrangement several of
the same types of panels 18 are supported by three different types of posts, i.e., a pair of conventional wide posts 4 retain panel edges inwardly along the lateral edge of the trailer, a pair of conversion posts 216 according to an embodiment of the
present invention cooperate with the conventional posts in supporting the opposite edges of the panels inwardly along the lateral edge of the trailer, and a reduced width post 4 according to the present invention cooperates with the two conversion posts
216 to retain two of the panels 18 spaced outwardly of the lateral edge of the trailer, a couple of inches outwardly of the other panels.  The lower edges of the panels 18 may be supported as discussed above, including through use of the trailer edge,
the pocket, a bumper bar 3 and/or a seal member 20.  The conversion post 216, shown in a larger scale in FIG. 4L, has the same width as the conventional post 4, but includes a first pair of panel-retaining grooves 6 on the inner side of the post, and a
second pair of grooves 6 on the outer side of the post.  With such construction, the same post 216 can retain edges of some panels inwardly toward the trailer and other panel edges outwardly away from the trailer.  This may be desirable, for example, if
a particularly wide load is supported at certain part(s) of the trailer, if it is necessary to extend load-securing chains or ropes over the sides of the trailer, etc. Of course, any combination of the various posts may be used as desired.
 Rails and Rail Locking Mechanism
 With reference to FIGS. 1 and 12A-12D there is shown support rails 22 disposed above the stakes 16 at the sides and rear end of the trailer, and in FIGS. 8 and 13A-14C, there are shown two embodiments of a rail locking mechanism 96 according to
the invention, and either one of these rail locking mechanisms may be used to connect the rails 22 to the stakes 16 and to the pockets 14.
 As shown best in FIG. 1, the rails 22 extend longitudinally along the sides of the trailer, and may be formed in multiple sections, e.g., two longer sections extending most of the trailer's length, and a short section at the front of the trailer
adjacent the headboard 26.  Alternatively, the rails 22 could be formed in shorter lengths corresponding to the length of the panels 18, or any other or various lengths if desired.  The rail section 22 extending along the rear of the trailer may be
formed in a single section as shown.
 The rail sections 22 can be disconnected from the stakes 16 and removed, as needed, when the trailer is parked in a secure location.  Because trailers flex and move during use, so as to be temporarily shaped concave or convex in the longitudinal
direction, gaps 23 (FIG. 1) may be provided between opposing faces of the rail sections 22, to accommodate such movement.
 The rail sections 22 may be formed of any appropriate material(s), including metals such as extruded aluminum, plastic, etc. and may have a cross sectional shape as shown in FIG. 12C, including a horizontal plate section 84, three downwardly
depending walls 82, 83, 85 which define inner and outer channels 86, 88 inside of the rail.  Two of the adjacent depending walls 83, 85 may include parallel horizontal flanges 89, 91 extending toward one another at lower edge portions of the depending
walls 83, 85, as shown, such that the parallel flanges define a slot 87 therebetween.  Optionally, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 12C, the rail sections 22 may also include an upwardly extending top wall 90.
 Also, as shown in FIG. 12B, a plurality of bow end supporting members 92, formed of plastic resin, metal, composites, or other appropriate material, may be provided in spaced relation along the rail 22.  In one embodiment of the system 10, these
bow end supporting members 92 may be fixed to the top wall 90 and/or the horizontal plate section 84 using an appropriate bonding agent, fastener, etc.
 The bow end supporting members 92 may each have an opening or recess 94 formed in the upper surface thereof that is adapted to securely receive therein a terminal end portion of a cover-supporting bow 25 therein, such that the bows may be
operatively connected to the rails 22 through the bow end supporting members 92.  The bow end supporting members 92 may be provided in any desired spacing along the rails, and need not specifically align with the stakes 16, unlike in conventional systems
where the bows are supported by the stakes and must be aligned therewith.
 The inner channel 86 of the rail 22 may have a substantially trapezoidal cross sectional shape with the slot 87 defined centrally along a bottom horizontal wall thereof, while the outer channel 88 may have a substantially trapezoidal cross
sectional shape with a completely open lower end, as depicted.  The bottom wall of the inner channel 86 is disposed adjacent to the upper end of the inner section 58 of the stake 16, although the end of the cap 73 may be disposed therebetween, and the
stake may be connected to the rail 22 at the inner channel 86 via the rail locking mechanism 96 according to the invention, as discussed further below.
 As shown in FIG. 15A, an upper horizontal edge of the panel 18 may extend within a lower portion of the outer channel 88 during normal use of the cover system 10, while an inner wall 83 of the outer channel 88 may be tapered inwardly, such that
the upper portion of the channel 88 has a greater width than the lower portion thereof.  Optionally, as noted above, the upper horizontal edge of the panel 18 may be reinforced with a reinforcement member 19 extending over the panel on three sides
thereof, as shown.  With such construction, after the stakes 16 have been removed, the upper edge of the panel 18 may be raised further within the channel 88 toward the bottom of the upper plate section 84, and then the lower portion of the panel may be
conveniently swung outwardly away from the trailer, to orient the panel 18 in the angled configuration shown in phantom in FIG. 15A, which greatly facilitates installation and removal of the panel by persons standing on the ground adjacent to the
trailer.
 With reference to FIGS. 12B and 13A, a first embodiment of the rail locking mechanism 96 for connecting the rail 22 to the stake 16 and the pocket 14 according to the invention will now be described.  As depicted, the rail locking mechanism 96
may include an elongate connecting rod 114, which extends from a handle portion 115 at the bottom of the pocket 14 through the stake 16 and ends with a threaded tip 117 disposed in the rail 22.  A lower portion of the rod 114 may extend through an
opening defined in a bottom wall of the pocket 14, and an enlarged lower end of the rod may be sized so that it cannot pass through the opening in the pocket bottom wall.  At the top of the rod 114, a connecting member or block 116 is disposed within the
inner channel 86 of the rail 22, and this block may include a threaded female nut member 118 therein for receiving and being connected to the threaded tip 117 of the rod 114.
 The connecting rod 114 may be formed of steel, a metal alloy, or other appropriate material(s), while the connecting member 116 may be formed of plastic or other appropriate material(s).  A segment of the connecting member 116 is shown in
perspective view in FIG. 13C.  The connecting member or block 116 may extend the full length of the rail 22 within the inner channel 86, having an appropriate number of openings formed therein for being connected to a plurality of the stakes 16.  Most of
the connecting rod 114 may extend through the stake inner section 58, such that it is normally concealed from view.  The lower end of the connecting rod 114 may have an appropriate tool engagement fitting formed therewith or provided thereon, e.g., a
slot or recess to receive a screwdriver head, a hexhead tool or the like, for being rotated by such a tool, may be threaded such that a wing nut or the like may screwed thereon, etc. The upper end of the rod having the threaded tip 117 may be securely
received in a threaded opening formed in the connecting member 116 or in a nut 118 secured in the member 116, and then spun to tighten the connecting member 116 and the rail 22 downwardly against the top of the stake 16.  The nut 118 may replace the
connecting member 116.
 With such construction, the rail locking mechanism 96 of the invention may be used to readily connect the rails 22 very securely and tightly to the stakes 16 and pockets 14, and to similarly disconnect these components as may be desired, by a
person standing on the ground adjacent to the trailer.  Particularly, the connecting rod 114 may be extended upwardly through the opening in the bottom wall of the pocket until the threaded upper end thereof engages the threaded opening in the connecting
member 116.  Then, the rod 114 may be rotated with an appropriate driving tool engaged with the rod's lower end, until the threaded upper end of the rod is securely threaded into the member 116.  As the rod is rotated more and more, the connecting member
116 engages the bottom wall of the rail inner channel 86, thereby drawing the rail 22 into very close and tight contact with the upper end of the stake 16 which is in turn tightly secured to the pocket 14.  Similarly, the lower end of the rod may be
threaded with a wing nut or the like secured thereto, the wing nut can be rotated to a degree necessary to draw the rail 22 into very close and tight contact with the upper end of the stake 16.
 This discussed connection between the rails 22, stakes 16 and pockets 14 via the rail locking mechanism 96 is another important aspect of the system 10 in comparison to conventional cover systems including stake-supported panels, which (again)
do not include any component corresponding to the rails 22 of the present invention.  For example, the connection provides significantly enhanced strength and stability to the system, and assures that there is little or no play between the stakes,
pockets and rails, which desirably reduces movements and vibrations of the components during travel, which reduces associated wear and noise, and again, the connection may be effected by a person standing on the ground adjacent to the trailer.
 If the connecting member 116 is formed of plastic or plastic foam, it is not only inexpensive to manufacture and lightweight, it also prevents direct contact between the connecting rod 114 and the rail 22, which is desirable to prevent rapid
wear of the rail, especially if the rail is formed of aluminum and the rod is formed of steel.  The connecting member 116 may have the threaded opening(s) formed directly therein, but could alternatively have threaded insert(s) 118 formed of steel or
other appropriate material glued or otherwise fixed within a non-threaded opening formed in the connecting member 116.  Also, a lower portion of the insert 118 or of the opening, where an insert is not used, may, optionally, have a tapered shape, to
facilitate insertion of the upper threaded end of the rod 114.
 The caps 73 provided in the ends of the stakes 16 may have openings 120 defined therein through which the rod 114 may pass, while a seal 122 may be provided in conjunction with a lower end of the rod 114 and/or with the lower cap 73 to prevent
water and other foreign matter from entering the lower end of the stake.
 As depicted in FIGS. 1 and 14D, adjacent ends of two abutting sections of the rails 22 may be connected to a single stake 16 and a single pocket 14.  In this case, two of the connecting rods 114 are used, one for each rail.  The connecting
member 116 may have a pair of the openings provided therein for receiving the end of the rods, where such adjacent rail sections are found, and the caps 73 may have multiple openings 120 defined therein at appropriate locations to permit the rods 114 to
pass therethrough.  In this manner, the rail sections are all connected together in the system for enhanced strength and rigidity.
 With reference to FIG. 14A, a second embodiment of the rail locking mechanism 96 according to the invention will now be described.  This embodiment includes components similar to those in the first embodiment, but differs primarily in the
structures associated with the ends of a connecting rod 124, and in the associated structure of the pocket 14.  Particularly, the upper end 125 of the connecting rod 124 may be enlarged in a substantially T-shape, and the lower end of the rod may have a
pivot handle 126 pivotally connected thereto via an eccentric connection 127.  With such structure, the handle 126 may be rotated about a vertical axis, corresponding to the rod 124, for selectively engaging and disengaging the T-shaped upper end 125
with the slot 87 formed in the bottom wall of the rail inner channel 86, for thereby connecting and disconnecting the rail 22 to the stake 16 and pocket 14; and the handle 126 may also be rotated about a horizontal axis, which causes the eccentric
connection 127, which is in engagement with a bottom wall of the pocket 14, to move the connecting rod 124 upwardly or downwardly in the stake inner section 58.  When the rod's upper end 125 is engaged with the bottom wall of the rail 22 in the inner
channel 86, and the rod is drawn downwardly by rotation of the handle 126, this correspondingly draws the rail 22 onto tight engagement with the stake 16, and draws the stake into tight engagement with the pocket 14.
 In this embodiment, the movable section 32 of the pocket 14 does not interfere with movements of the handle 126 when the section 32 is in the open position thereof, but will prevent the handle from being moved when the section 32 is in the
closed position thereof.  This is, of course, desirable to maintain the rail, stake and pocket tightly connected together when the trailer is traveling.  Further, the base and/or movable sections of the pocket 14 will be modified, in this embodiment, to
accommodate the handle 126 and/or the eccentric pivot connection 127.
 The connecting member 116 may optionally be used in this embodiment, although it does not require a threaded opening therein to be connected to the enlarged T-shaped upper end 125 of the rod, or instead, the connecting member 116 may be replaced
by a thin flat plastic reinforcing member 119 with a suitably-shaped opening to receive the tip end 125 of the connecting rod 124 therethrough.  If the connecting member 116 is formed of plastic, it will desirably prevent direct contact between the rod
upper end 114 and the rail.  Alternatively, the connecting member 116 may be omitted, and the rod upper end 125 may have a plastic cover or coating provided thereon, to prevent contact between the steel rod and the aluminum rail.
 Panels Supported Without Stakes
 Due to the added strength and stability provided to the cover system by the rail sections 22 and rail locking mechanisms 96, which secure the upper edges of the panels to the system, according to another modification of the present invention at
least some of the panels may be modified such that they are supported with no stakes or with only one stake, such as shown in FIGS. 11D, 11E.  As in the depicted embodiment, the side edges of the panels may be modified such that they overlap with and
sealingly engage with the edges of adjacent panels, while the upper edges of the panels are retained in the channels of the rail sections 22, and the lower edges of the panels are supported by the seal members 20 provided on the bumper rail 3 as
discussed above.  Also, fastening clips 172 may be provided for further securing the lower portion of one or more of the panels to bumper rail 3 or to some other part of the trailer.  As depicted, one of the side edges of each of a pair panels 18', or
the panel edge reinforcing member 19 (not shown) thereon, may be formed with a stepped shape facing outwardly away from the trailer 12, while the opposite edges of the panels 18' have a conventional shape for being supported in channels 62 of respective
posts, while a third panel 18'' may be formed with a stepped shape on both side edges thereof facing inwardly toward the trailer, such that when the panel 18'' is engaged with the panels 18' the stepped edges of the panel 18'' overlap the stepped edges
of the panels 18'.  As thus disposed, the outer surfaces of the panels 18', 18''extend flushly to each other, giving the panels a favorable appearance and excellent aerodynamics.  Also, a seal 174 formed of elastomeric material or other appropriate
material may be provided between the overlapped panel edges for assuring a desirable sealing function between the panels during operative use of the system, including when the vehicle is traveling.  The seal 174 may be secured to one or both of the
overlapping panel edges.
 The fastening clip 172 may be connected to a lower portion of a panel 18'' so as to be pivotable thereto, and may be formed of spring steel or other appropriate material such that a free end of the clip may be securely engaged to the bumper rail
3 through a snap fit or the like without additional fastening means.  By securing the panel 18'' with the clip 172, this effectively also secures the adjacent overlapped panels 18' having the stepped edges which are engaged and secured to the system by
the inwardly facing, stepped edges of panel 18'', such that it is not necessary to provide the panels 18' with the clips 172, although it is certainly possible to do so if desired.  Also, the free end of the clip may have a projection 173 provided
therewith which an operator may grasp for easily manipulating the clip fastener onto or off of the bumper rail.  Again, the panels may also be provided with a handle for facilitating manipulation of same as discussed above, or the fastening clip 172 may
also function as a handle.
 In use, when it is desired to expose a portion of a flat support surface covered by the cover system, an operator standing on the ground adjacent to the vehicle may readily remove the panel 18'' by unfastening the clip 172, lifting the panel
18'' off of the supporting seal 20, swinging the lower end of the panel outwardly, whereby the upper edge of the panel is rotated in the angled channel of the rail 22, and then removing the panel 18''.  Then one of the adjacent panels 18' may be removed
by sliding it over somewhat into the space previously occupied by panel 18'', lifting it off of the seal 20, then swinging the bottom portion of the panel outwardly and downwardly, and this procedure may be repeated for removing the other adjacent panel
18'.  Thus, through this arrangement of the invention a relatively large space may be opened in a side of the cover system equal to the collective area of three of the panels 18', 18'', e.g., approximately 24 feet wide and four feet tall.  To replace the
panels 18', 18'', the above procedure may be performed in reverse sequence.
 This modification of the system is very desirable because (among other reasons): it reduces the number of stakes and pockets required to support the panels on the system, and hence cost and weight of the system; it similarly facilitates assembly
and disassembly of the system by an operator; it provides enhanced design freedom for the system in that the panels can be formed of various sizes; outer surfaces of the overlapping panels can be very flush with each other for improved aerodynamics and
appearance, etc.
 Tarp Cover and Bows
 The tarp cover 24 extends over the flatbed trailer from the headboard 26 to the end cap 28.  The tarp cover 24 also extends downwardly above the longitudinal sides of the trailer 12 to approximately the level of the rails 22, or the upper
portions of the panels 18, so as to enclose the upper portion of the cargo space defined by the panels 18, stakes 16, headboard 26 and end cap 28.
 The bows 25 extend beneath the tarp cover 24 to support same.  The bows 25 may be arch-shaped as shown, oriented with the height of the arch at the top, or may be flat or any other desired shape.  Opposite ends of each bow 25 may be operatively
connected to and supported in recesses 94 of the bow end supporting members 92 provided on the rails 22, as discussed above and shown in FIG. 12B.  If no end cap 28 and/or headboard 26 is used with the system, a bow would be disposed at a corresponding
endmost position and the tarp cover may extend over the end(s) of the cover system similarly to the sides of the cover system.  Further, if rails 22 are not used with the cover system, then the bow ends may be supported by the stakes 16, e.g., by
insertion of same into openings 94' formed in upper ends of the stakes as shown in FIG. 23, and latch mechanisms 221 may be used to secure lateral edges of the tarp cover closely to the stakes as discussed further below.
 The bows 25 can be made of any appropriate material(s), though extruded aluminum is suited well for the application, while the tarp 24 may be formed of vinyl, cloth-reinforced vinyl, or any other material as desired, including mesh or porous
materials.  Each of the bows 25 may be formed as one continuous member, or in multiple sections joined together.  Conventional bows and tarp covers may be used in the cover system of the present invention.
 Although not shown, ropes, elastic cords and the like may be used to secure the lower edges of the tarp cover to the trailer in a conventional manner, e.g., extending between openings/eyelets near the edges of the tarp cover and the sides of the
trailer.
 With reference to FIGS. 23-25, however, according to another novel aspect of the present invention, there is provided novel retaining mechanisms for the tarp cover which replaces, or may be used in combination with, the conventional elastic
straps, ropes, etc. As disclosed herein, different mechanisms may be used to secure different portions of the tarp, e.g., front, intermediate, and rear portions, and the mechanisms may be used whether the bows are supported directly by the stakes, or
supported on the upper rail 22 which is supported on the stakes.  FIGS. 23-23D and 29D show embodiments of retaining mechanisms which support the tarp cover when the bows are directly supported on the stakes, and are discussed further below.  As shown
the different embodiments of the securing mechanism each include a type of manually-actuatable locking mechanism through which an operator can selectively lock the latch member in an operative position securing the edge of the tarp cover closely adjacent
to the bow end and unlock the latch member for being moved from the operative position thereof without the use of a tool.
 FIGS. 24-25 show embodiments of retaining mechanisms 220, 220' which support the tarp cover when the bows are supported on the upper rails 22.  The retaining mechanisms 220 shown in FIGS. 24-24B are connected to the bow end retaining members 92
and generally includes latches 221 which may be pivotally connected to end portions of the bows, and pockets 222 formed on the inner surfaces of the tarp cover 24 near lower edges thereof.  Alternatively, the retaining mechanism 220 could be connected to
another portion of the upper rail 22 such as the vertical wall 90.  With an intermediate portion of the latch 221 pivotally supported on the supporting member 92 of the rail 22, one end of the latch functions as a handle which may be manipulated by an
operator, and the other end of the latch is formed as a securing member that can be inserted into and removed from the retaining pocket 222 via pivoting movements of the latch.  Also, a securing or locking member 224 may be used to selectively secure the
handle adjacent the bow end portion, and thereby lock the latch in its operative position.  For example, the securing member 224 may comprise a ring slidably disposed on the bow end portion which functions by simply being slid onto and off of the handle,
or a hook-and-loop fastening strap could be disposed at an appropriate location for securing the handle to the bow end portion.  The latches may be formed of metal such as steel or aluminum, rigid plastic, or other appropriate material.
 In the operative securing position the latches 221 may hold the lower portions of the tarp cover 24 closely adjacent to the outside surface of the rail 22, e.g., adjacent to the outer surface of the upper vertically extending wall 90 of the
rail.  For all of the latches 221 the axis about which the latch pivots may extend substantially horizontally relative to the trailer as shown in FIG. 24, so that the latch pivots vertically up and down.  However, the latches 221 at the rearmost and/or
front most positions at the two sides of the trailer may alternatively be constructed with an off-axis pivot axis such that tension will be applied to the tarp cover when these mechanisms are fully closed (i.e. tarp held down) and tarp tension is
released when these mechanisms are raised (i.e. letting the tarp loose).  In other words, the intermediate tarp hold-down mechanisms may have the horizontal pivot axes and can only move the tarp up and down along a vertical direction.  However the latch
mechanisms on the four corners of the vehicle can have their pivot axes tilted off the horizontal such that they mostly move the tarp up and down along the vertical (like the intermediate mechanisms), but they also move the tarp slightly frontwards or
backwards to provide tensioning to the tarp.  Applying such tension to the tarp cover is desirable for increasing water-tightness of the tarp relative to the trailer, for improving the aerodynamic characteristic and aesthetic appearance of the tarp
cover, increasing durability of the tarp cover, etc.
 The rail may also be provided with a seal member which extends outwardly from the wall 90 or another portion of the rail such that the seal member will engage the inner surface of the tarp cover when disposed in its operative covering position,
to prevent water and other foreign matter from passing between the cover and the rail.  Such a seal is shown at 225 in FIGS. 15F, 15G.  For example the wall 90 or other portion of the rail 22 may have a retaining groove formed therein and extending the
full longitudinal length of the rail, and the seal member 225 may be a continuous length of elastomeric material having one edge slidably and securely retained in the groove.
 In use of the retaining mechanism, an operator (who may be standing on the trailer bed) would release the handle latch from the fastener and pivot the latch such that the securing member is withdrawn from the retaining pocket of the tarp cover,
and would repeat this maneuver for as many of the latches as desired.  To secure the cover, such procedure may be reversed.  The retaining mechanism 220, being disposed entirely within the tarp cover 24, provides improved aerodynamics and appearance
compared to the conventional elastic straps and ropes, which have been used.  Also because the latches 221 are connected to the upper rails 22, they will not become lost or displaced similar to the elastic straps and ropes.
 A modification to the retaining mechanism 220 is shown in FIG. 24B.  In the modification an engaging member 93 is provided which projects outwardly at an intermediate part of the wall 90, and the securing member at the outside end of the latch
221 is provided with a inwardly extending projection 223 which securely engages the engaging member 93 in the operative position of the latch.  In this modification the endmost portion of the securing member at the outside end of the latch, together with
the lower edge of the tarp cover, extends inwardly within a channel defined by the wall 90, the engaging member 93 and the horizontal surface 84 of the rail.  This helps to prevent water and other foreign matter from passing between the tarp cover and
the rail.  Also, the seal member 225 may be provided to project outwardly/downwardly from the wall 90 or the engaging member 93 for engaging the inner surface of the tarp cover.
 Referring to FIG. 25, a latch 221' of the retaining mechanism may be pivotally provided with the end of the bow 25, rather than to the rail 22.  Here the intermediate portion of the latch 221' is pivotally supported on the bow, but the latch
otherwise functions similar to the latch 221 in FIG. 24, and again may include latches 221' at the rearmost and/or front most positions at the two sides of the trailer constructed with an off-axis pivot axis such that tension will be applied to the tarp
when the latches are closed.
 Although the bows 25 and tarp cover 24 may be supported on the rails 22 as discussed above, again, the rails 22 could be omitted, and the bow ends supported directly by the stakes 16 such as shown in FIG. 23-23E, wherein the upper ends of the
stakes could have the openings formed therein which are adapted to securely receive the bow ends therein.  Alternatively, an upward projection could be provided at the upper end of each of the respective stakes, which is shaped to have a hollow opening
of the bow end slidably fitted thereover.  Also, if a cap 73 is provided with the end of the stake 16, the cap would have an opening defined therein which corresponds to the opening.
 As shown in FIG. 23, a latch 221'' of the retaining mechanism 220 may be connected to upper ends of the stakes 16.  Besides its connection to the stake, the latch 221'' is different than the latches 221 and 221' in that it includes two pivot
connections and an intermediate link which permits the latch handle to be operatively moved between a locked operative position and an unlocked open position.  Again, however, the latches 221'' at the rearmost and/or front most positions at the two sides
of the trailer may alternatively be constructed with an off-axis pivot axis such that tension will be applied to the tarp cover when the latches are closed.
 Shown in FIGS. 23A-23C is latch mechanism 321 which is slidably fitted over the bow end through opening 322.  The latch mechanism 321 includes a securing member 323 which fits into a pocket of the tarp cover (not shown), lower projection(s) 324
which closely fits into an opening defined in an upper end of the stake 16, handle 327 which may be gripped by an operator for manipulating the mechanism, and a spring-biased lever 326 which is pivotally connected to the handle and includes a securing
pin 326' on a lower end thereof that fits into an opening formed near an upper end of the stake 16.  For securing the tarp cover with the latch mechanism, the lever 326 is pivoted close to the handle 327, the mechanism is manipulated so that the securing
member 323 is inserted into a pocket of the tarp cover and the lower projection(s) are inserted into opening(s) formed in the upper end of the stake, and the lever 326 is released so that the pin 326' is inserted into the associated opening formed in the
stake.  To release the tarp cover such process is reversed.
 Latch mechanisms 331, 341 shown in FIGS. 23D, 23E are similar to the latch mechanism 321 in FIGS. 23A-23C except that they include cam-actuated compression mechanisms for being secured to the stake 16, rather than a pivot lever with a securing
pin on a lower end thereof.  The latch mechanism 331 includes a compression member 335 and a rubber member 336 provided on a lower end of a rod 337 which extends through a lower projection 334 of the latch mechanism which can be fitted into an opening in
the upper end of the stake 16, and a cam lever 338 pivotally connected to the upper end of the rod 337.  For securing the latch mechanism to the stake the cam lever is manipulated to raise the rod 337, which thereby raises the compression member to
compress the rubber member 336 such that the rubber member expands to securely engage the inner walls of the stake which define the opening in the upper end thereof.  The latch mechanism 341 is similar to the mechanism 331, but includes a handle 342 for
facilitating manipulation of the mechanism, and a slightly different cam member which pivots forwardly rather than inwardly of the stake.
 Movable Retraction System For Tarp Cover
 While the bows 25 and tarp cover 24 may be non-movably supported on the rails 22 or the stakes 16 as discussed above, in another embodiment according to the present invention, a movable retraction system may be provided for the tarp cover, and
an embodiment of such a rolling-type movable retraction system is shown in FIGS. 8 and 15A-18.  With the movable retraction system, the tarp cover may be selectively movable from either or both ends toward the opposite end, to selectively expose portions
of flatbed trailer normally covered by the tarp cover.  Of course, it is also possible that one end of the tarp cover, e.g., the front end, may be fixed in position at one end of the rail, while the opposite end of the tarp cover may selectively be moved
back-and-forth toward the fixed end.
 As shown in FIG. 15A, this embodiment may include a modification to the rails 22' in the form of an integral, substantially T-shaped upward extension 130 that functions as a support track/guide for supporting rolling movement of inner and outer
rolling guide assemblies 132, 134 thereon.  The guide assemblies 132, 134 are operatively connected to the lower ends of the bows 25 such that the bows and tarp cover supported thereon may be easily moved along the track for selectively exposing and
covering the storage space within the cover system.  Also, locking and/or tensioning mechanisms may be provided for securing endmost ones of the guide assemblies 132, 134 of the cover system in their endmost positions corresponding to the fully covering
position of the cover system shown in FIG. 1, as discussed further below.
 In embodiment of FIG. 15A, the T-shaped upward extension 130 replaces the vertical wall 90 of the rails 22 in the first embodiment, as the tarp cover 24 and bows 25 are supported by the extension 130 and guide assemblies as discussed further
below.  With the rolling retraction system, the tarp cover may be readily and conveniently moved to various positions by a person standing adjacent to the trailer, for selectively uncovering portions of the flatbed trailer for cargo loading and
unloading, or for any other reason.  Because the rolling cover is disposed at a height where it could not be directly grasped by the average person standing on the ground next to the trailer, an elongate handle, strap, pole or the like (not shown) may be
provided with or selectively engaged to the cover system for permitting a person to conveniently move the cover system while standing on the ground.
 Also, the tarp cover 24 may be formed in segments, rather than as one large piece, as is conventionally known.  In such case, the bow 25 may be modified to include a retainer 97 as shown in FIG. 19 so that the bow may also function as a
connector for joining the edges of two adjacent segments, as is conventionally known.  Particularly, edges of the segments will be enlarged, e.g., by having a tube or cord 27 sewn or otherwise bonded into opposite edge flaps of each segment, and then the
enlarged edges of a pair of the cover segments may be slidably inserted into the lobes of a groove 98 defined in the retainer 97.  The diameter of the enlarged edge of a cover segment is larger than the width of the opening of the groove 98, so that
after the edge has been inserted into the lobe of the groove 98 the edge is securely retained and cannot be removed by passing through the groove opening.  From the outside of the cover 24, the segmented cover completely covers the bows 25 and appears to
be formed as a one-piece cover.  Other known connector structures for securing enlarged edges of tarp segments may include a pair of separate grooves formed on opposite sides of the bow, with each groove adapted to receive only one segment edge.  With
these types of connectors the bow would not be completely covered by the tarp cover and could be seen from the outside of the cover system.  The bow structure in FIG. 19 cold also be used to secure portions of a single continuous tarp cover, e.g., folds
of the tarp cover may be inserted into the lobes of the groove 98 and lengths of the cord or tube 27 could be slid into the folds to prevent the folds from being withdrawn from the lobes, and the lengths of cord or tube 27 could be withdrawn if it is
desired to withdraw the folds from the groove 98.
 Also, according to this modified embodiment of the invention, when the tarp cover 24 is retracted to a fully open position thereof, the collapsed cover and bows may be conveniently locked in position at the front of the trailer adjacent the
headboard 26, and supported on the short, forward-most sections of the rails 22' on opposite sides of the trailer, which may correspond with the headboard extension 228' shown in FIG. 31.  In this condition, with the tarp cover 24 and bows 25 locked in a
compact, collapsed condition adjacent to the headboard 26, the larger sections of the rails 22', as well as the panels 18 and stakes 16, may be temporarily removed and stored with the headboard and/or underneath the trailer 12, if desired.
 As shown best in FIG. 15A, the T-shaped upward extension 130 of the rail 22' may be formed integrally therewith, e.g., the rail 22' including the extension may be integrally formed of appropriate material(s) such as extruded aluminum, which is
durable and lightweight.  The lower and/or upper surfaces of the upper portion of the extension 130 may have projections 133 formed thereon and the wheels 136 may have peripheral grooves formed therein which are shaped similar to the projections, and
engage the projections for rolling movement therealong.  For example, the projections 133 could be tapered with a V-shaped cross section and the peripheral groove may similarly have a corresponding V-shaped cross section, such as shown in FIG. 15A, or
the projections could have a flat or a more rounded/spherical shape.  Replaceable plastic covers (not shown) may be provided on the projections for engagement with the wheels 136.  The plastic covers have a natural lubricating effect for facilitating
movement of the wheels, and may be replaced after they become worn.
 Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 8, the extension 130 may be formed separately from the rail 22' and connected thereto.  An upper portion of the extension 130 may have a flat upper surface 135 which supports wheels 136 of the guide assemblies
132, 134 for rolling movement thereon, and the upper surface 135 may also have an insert 138 provided therewith, e.g., fitted in a shallow recess formed in the upper surface of the extension 130, as shown.  The insert 138, where used, may be formed of an
appropriate material such as plastic, steel, or other appropriate material, and may be removable so as to be readily replaced if desired or necessary.  The lower surface of the extension 130 may be formed with an insert 138 similar to the upper surface. 
Additionally, the upper portion of the extension 130 may include wheel guide recesses 140 formed in the lower surface thereof, which receive other wheels 136 of the guide assemblies 132, 134 for rolling movement therealong.  The recesses 140 may be
concavely curved, as shown, but could be other shapes if desired, including U-shaped, V-shaped and flat, and the wheels may be formed with a corresponding shape.
 Referring to FIGS. 8, 15A-15C and 17A-17C, the outer guide assembly 134 of this embodiment may include a vertically extending support plate 144 which may be substantially triangular in shape, a plurality of the wheels 136 (e.g., three in the
depicted embodiment) rotatably supported on the plate via shafts projecting horizontally from the plate at two vertically spaced levels such that the wheels engage the upper and lower surfaces of the upper portion of the extension 130 as shown in FIG.
15A, a receiver or bracket 146 fixed to the upper portion of the plate 144 for slidably receiving and supporting an end of one of the bows 25, and a tarp clip 148 connected to an outer surface of the plate 144 below the bracket 146.  The tarp clip 148
may have a projection on its outer surface with a lobed groove formed therein which is shaped the same as and aligned with the lobed groove 98 on the bows 25 as shown in FIG. 19, and may also have a lower portion which curves inwardly below the plate 144
and the wheels 136 and terminating in close, but spaced relation to the rail 22' where it may be engaged by a seal 151 extending from the extension 130 of the rail 22'.  The tarp cover extends below the ends of the bows 25 on opposite sides of the
trailer, and downwardly extending portions of the cover may be secured to the tarp clips 148 by being inserted in the lobed grooves of the tarp clips in the same manner as discussed in relation to the lobed grooves of the bows 25.  The lowermost edges of
the tarp cover may be enlarged or weighted, e.g., by having a tube or cord sewn into an overlap of material forming the edge, and portions of the cover's lower edges may be secured to lower, inner ends of the tarp clips using appropriate fasteners.  With
such construction, the tarp cover 24 encloses the guide assemblies 132, 134 such that the assemblies 132, 134 are protected from exposure to water and other foreign matter, and do not detract from the aesthetic appearance of the cover system.  Also, due
to the disposition of the side edges of the tarp cover which extend inwardly with the tarp clips 148 close to extension 130, together with the seal 151 extending from the extension to engage the inner surface of the tarp clip as shown, the tarp cover
provides an excellent, reliable seal against water and other foreign matter entering within the enclosed space of the cover system
 Referring to FIGS. 8, 15A-15C and 18, the outer guide assembly 134 of this embodiment may have a similar structure to that of the inner guide assembly 132, e.g., a vertically extending support plate 150 which may be substantially triangular in
shape, a plurality of the wheels 136 (e.g., again, three in the depicted embodiment) rotatably supported on the plate via shafts projecting horizontally from the plate at two vertically spaced levels such that the wheels engage the upper and lower
surfaces of the upper portion of the extension 130 as shown in FIG. 15A-15C, and a receiver or bracket 152 projecting outwardly from an outer face of the upper portion of the plate 144 via arms 154 for slidably receiving and supporting an end of one of
the bows 25.  As depicted, the bracket 152 is aligned with the bracket 146, e.g., at the same vertical level and the same outward disposition as the bracket 146, so that the tarp cover is uniformly supported by the brackets 146, 152, and the cover also
encloses the guide assemblies 132, 134.  Also, each of the brackets may have an opening or slot formed in the outer face thereof so that the brackets may tightly engage most of the periphery of each bow 2 except for the projection, and will
correspondingly not interfere with the tarp cover 24 where it extends from the lobed groove within the projection.
 The inner and outer guide assemblies 132, 134 may be alternately disposed with each other in the longitudinal direction of the trailer, while approximately half of the triangular support plates 144, 150 may be oriented in one direction while the
rest of the plates are oriented in the opposite direction, as shown in FIGS. 15A-15C and 16, to achieve a desirably compact arrangement of the tarp cover 24 and bows 25 in the fully retracted position of the cover, e.g., completely supported on the
short, forward most sections of the rails 22'.  Particularly, as shown in FIGS. 15B, 15C, and 16, the inner and outer guide assemblies 132, 134 may be alternately disposed with each other in the longitudinal direction of the trailer, while the support
plates 144, 150 may be arranged such that two adjacent plates 144, 150 are disposed in one orientation, and the next two plates in the longitudinal direction are disposed in the opposite orientation, etc. In this manner, all of the bows 25 can be
disposed closely adjacent to each other in the retracted position of the cover system because the guide assemblies will not interfere with other.
 Of course, those skilled in the art will realize that other possible arrangements of the guide assemblies are possible, e.g., all guide assemblies may be positioned on the outer side of the extension 130.  Similarly, other possible shapes and
arrangements of the support plates are possible, e.g., rectangular shaped plates each supporting four of the wheels, triangular shaped plates which wherein each plate is disposed in the opposite orientation to the plate(s) adjacent thereto, etc.
 Generally, the tarp cover 24 may tend to sag between the bows.  To avoid this, lifter bows 156 may be provided in conjunction with the bows 25, wherein the lifter bows collapse adjacent to the bows 25 in the fully retracted position of the cover
system, but pivot away from opposite sides of the bows 25 in the full covering position of the tarp cover, and upper horizontal portions of the lifter bows 156 may engage portions of the tarp cover, pushing the portions upwardly and thereby tensioning
the cover to some extent.  Additionally, the cover system may also include one or more mechanisms for tensioning the tarp cover in the full covering position thereof, as discussed further below, noting that a tensioned tarp is more aerodynamic and
aesthetic than an un-tensioned tarp.  Such tensioning mechanisms may operatively connect the front headboard 26 to the front-most bow 25 and/or operatively connect the end cap 28 to the rear-most bow 25.
 With the disclosed rolling retraction system, the cover system may be easily and conveniently moved to a desired position by a person standing on the ground adjacent to the trailer.  For example, if tensioning mechanism(s) other than lifter bows
are used, the mechanisms may be manipulated by the person to release the tension, then one or both ends of the tarp cover may be released from being connected to the headboard 26 and end cap 28, after which the tarp cover 24 and supporting bows 25 may be
simply moved to a desired position by the person using a pole, strap, etc. to engage a portion of the cover, one of the bows or one of the guide assemblies 132, 134, and then simply pulling or pushing the same as the operator walks alongside of the
trailer.  The rolling engagement between the wheels 136 of the guide assemblies and the extension 130 permit smooth, continuous movement of the cover system with little effort.
 As with the other embodiment of the rails 22, in this embodiment the rails 22' may be removed if desired.  Again, the tarp cover 24 and bows 25 may be compactly stored at one end of the trailer, e.g., the front end, on short sections of the rail
22' adjacent the headboard 26.  Removal of the remaining sections of the rails 22' can be performed from the ground, e.g., the rail locking mechanisms can be released, the rail sections may then be raised off of the stakes 16 and panels 18 using a pole,
and then lowered to the ground by a person standing next to the trailer.  The rail sections 22' may be formed of relatively lightweight materials such as extruded aluminum, and may be stored on the flatbed when not in use, e.g., beneath the flat bed
adjacent a longitudinal frame (not shown) of the trailer 12.
 The tarp cover supported by the guide assemblies 132, 134 and the rail extension 130, as in the embodiment discussed above, is another important aspect of the invention.  Such arrangement is much more convenient and aesthetic than the
conventional bow-supported tarp cover draped over the upper portions of the stake-supported panels and secured with ropes, elastic cords and the like.  Although rolling tarp cover systems for flatbed trailers are known, e.g., some of the present
inventors have previously patented such systems as disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,924,759, 5,152, 575 and 5,080,422, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, such known systems typically include guide rails permanently
mounted to the sides of the trailer's flatbed, and an enclosed cargo space defined between the tarp cover and the flatbed.  The previously proposed cover systems are significantly larger than the movable tarp of the present invention because the previous
systems fully cover a flatbed trailer, and include a tarp cover with long vertical sides as well as an upper substantially horizontal portion.  None of the known rolling tarp systems are provided for use in conjunction with removable rails or with a
removable, stake-supported panel cover system, nor are they disposed at an elevated level above stake-supported panels as in the present invention.
 While the rolling-type movable tarp cover discussed above is effective and convenient, other types of movable systems may be used in which a guide assembly slides relative to the rail 22, rather than rolling along the rail.  For example, a
sliding-type movable tarp cover may be used such as shown in FIGS. 15D, 15E.  As depicted such sliding-type movable cover may include a modified rail 22 having a hook-shaped upper extension 229, and a modified guide assembly 232 which is slidably
connected to the upper extension for sliding movement relative thereto.  The upper extension 229 may extend vertically upwardly from the horizontal surface 84 of the rail, then extends horizontally outwardly, and finally extends vertically downwardly a
short distance such that there is a gap or opening between the free end of the upper extension and the surface 84.  For facilitating sliding movement of guide assembly 232, an insert 138 formed of plastic or other appropriate material may be provided in
the upper horizontal surface of the extension 229 and similarly another insert 238 formed of plastic or other appropriate material may be provided in a lower surface of the guide assembly in opposing relation to the insert 138 such that the two inserts
engage each other and define a primary sliding contact area for the guide assembly along the upper extension.  Because the inserts 138, 139 may be formed of relatively low friction plastics or other low friction materials, an amount of friction
associated with the sliding movement of the guide assembly 232 is reduced.  Also, if either of the inserts 138, 139 becomes worn with use over time, they may be easily replaced at relatively low cost.  Suitable grease may also be applied to the engaging
surfaces of the inserts for further reducing friction associated with sliding movement of the guide assembly 232.  A lower structure of the rail 22 which operatively engages the stake and panels is omitted in FIGS. 15D, 15E.
 For further facilitating movement of a movable tarp cover according to the invention, whether sliding-type, rolling type, etc., air or other suitable gas may be blown between engaging surfaces of the guide assembly and the rail.  For example, as
shown in FIG. 15D, numerous openings 138' may be formed through the insert 138 in a rolling-type system, and/or through the insert 138 and/or 139 in a sliding-type system, and pressurized air from a vehicle's pneumatic system may be channeled through a
manifold to a back surface of the insert 138 or 139 for being selectively blown through the openings when the guide assembly is to be moved along the rail 22.  Again, the pressurized air being blown into the space between the insert 138 and the engaging
surface of the guide assembly, the rolling wheel 136 or the insert 139, further reduces friction associated with the movement of the guide assembly.  The sliding system shown in FIGS. 15D, 15E is also suitable for use with larger rolling tarp systems
such as shown in applicant's previous U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  5,924,759, 5,152,575 and 5,080,422.
 Another embodiment of a sliding tarp cover system according to the present invention is shown in FIGS. 15F, 15G, 15H.  In this embodiment the rail sections 22 are provided with an extension 201 which integrally includes one or more (two are
depicted) sliding support rods 202 which may be circular in cross section as depicted, while opposite ends of each of the bows 203 have a receiver 204 provided therewith which has a groove defined therein which is shaped to receive one of the sliding
support rods therein such that each bow can be slid along the corresponding sliding support rod 202 to any desired position.  For purposes of compactly arranging the bows 203 closely to each other when the tarp cover is in a retracted, non-covering
position thereof, adjacent ones of the bows 203 may be guided on different ones of the rods 202, in a manner analogous to the arrangement of the rolling carriers shown in FIGS. 15B, 15C.
 Sleeves 205 may be provided between the sliding support rods 202 and the grooved receivers 204 and may be made of an appropriate material such as plastic which has a natural lubricating effect and facilitates sliding movement of the bows along
the support rods, and also reduce wear of the rods and receivers.  If the sleeves become worn over time, they may be easily replaced.  If desired, grease or other lubricant may also be provided between the rods 202 and receivers 204.  The extension 201
may be formed from extruded aluminum and appropriately joined to the rail section 22 using bolts, rivets, welding, etc., or the extension may be formed integrally with the rail section 22.  Similarly, the receivers 204 may be formed of extruded aluminum
or other appropriate material and either connected to the bows or formed integrally therewith.  Also, as with other embodiments, the rearmost bow 206 may have enhanced strength and rigidity as compared to the other bows because it supports the greatest
load.  For example, the rearmost bow may have a dual structure as depicted in FIG. 15H.
 As depicted, the cross-sectional shape of the openings in the receivers 204 may not be exactly the same at the opposite ends of a bow, for the purpose of facilitating sliding movement of the bows.  For example, while the shape of the opening of
the receiver 204 on one end of the bow, e.g., the right side end shown in FIG. 15G, may closely conform to a circular cross-sectional shape of the rod 202, the shape of the opening of the receiver 204 on the opposite end of the bow, e.g., the left side
end shown in FIG. 15F may not be as closely conforming to the circular shape of the rod.  As depicted, the shape of the opening of the receiver 204 on the left side end shown in FIG. 15F may be somewhat oblong to permit some amount of movement of the
receiver relative to the rod as the bow is slid back-and-forth along relative to the trailer.  Generally, it is desirable and convenient for an operator to move the tarp cover relative to the trailer by applying a force (pushing or pulling) to one side
of an end one of the bows, and as the end bow is moved, it also moves the other bows which are operatively pushed or pulled by the end bow as it is moved along, noting that all of the bows are interconnected by the tarp cover.  When a pulling or pushing
force is applied to only one side of a bow, the opposite side of the bow tends to lag somewhat behind, and such lagging motion may cause the receiver opening on the opposite side of the bow to bind on the rod it is moving along if the receiver opening is
shaped to closely conform to the cross-sectional shape of the rod.  According to the present invention, however, because the receiver opening on one side of the bow does not closely conform to the circular shape of the rod, but instead allows for some
movement of the receiver relative to the rod, the bow receivers do not bind on the rods and continue to move smoothly therealong.
 Locking and Tensioning Mechanisms
 To secure the movable tarp system in an operative, fully closed position, as well as in a fully open, collapsed position thereof, the cover system may further include locking and/or tensioning mechanisms for securing endmost ones of the guide
assemblies in rear-most and front-most positions thereof.
 As one simple locking mechanism, the endmost guide assembly 132 may be provided with a set screw/pin 180 which may be selectively manipulated into a corresponding opening 182 formed in the rail 22 when the guide assembly is disposed at its
endmost position, such as shown in FIG. 26.  A plurality of the openings may be provided in spaced relation along an end portion of the rail 22 such that the screw/pin 180 may be selectively inserted in different ones of the openings to account for
stretching or expansion of the tarp cover over time.  Because two of the guide assemblies would be associated with the opposite ends of an endmost bow 25 on opposite sides of the trailer 12, both of the guide assemblies may be provided with the locking
mechanism for stably securing both ends of the bow.
 With reference to FIG. 27, a different mechanism 184 may be provided which functions to both lock the guide assembly 132 in an endmost position thereof, as well as to forcibly move the guide assembly toward the endmost position thereby
tensioning the tarp cover 24 in its operative, fully covering position.  Such tensioning is desirable for improving the appearance, aerodynamic characteristics, and longevity of the tarp cover.  The mechanism 184 may include a threaded rod 185 that is
positioned generally parallel to the rail 22 on which the guide assembly 132 is supported for rolling movement and provides the tensioning force to move the guide assembly and end bow 25 towards the end of the truck/trailer, and thereby also drawing the
tarp cover 24 and the other movable guide assemblies in the direction of the end position because the several parts are connected together.  A hook 186 on the threaded rod 185 may engage a carriage portion of the guide assembly 132 and draw the end bow
25 towards the end of the truck/trailer when the rod is rotated by a removable crank handle 187 or the like.  To release tension and unlock the bow from the rail, the rod may be rotated in the opposite direction.
 Again, in this type of cover system the end bow 25 and other tarp-supporting bows of the system include a pair of ends on opposite sides of the trailer, and a pair of the tensioning and locking mechanisms 184 may be operatively associated with
the two ends of the endmost bow 25 for jointly tensioning and locking both sides of the bow.  In the present drawings, only one vertically extending side portion of the end bow 25 is shown in conjunction with one of the mechanisms 184, but the other side
portion of the end bow would have another identical mechanism 184 operatively associated therewith, and another of the rails 22 would be on the opposite side of the trailer.  Each of the mechanisms 184 may be operated independently of the other
mechanism.
 Although tensioning and locking mechanism 184 may be a manual device, as shown, it could alternatively or additionally be driven by a motor (not shown).  It is also within the scope of the present invention that other devices may be used in
place of device 184, including a ratcheting winch strap, a rack and pinion with a ratchet gear, a ratchet rack (without a pinion gear), an over-center cam lock, a pneumatic or hydraulic piston, an electric motor which winds/unwinds a cable, etc. In
addition, the end bow 25 and its supporting carriage may be constructed larger and stronger than the intermediate bows 25 and intermediate carriages for additional strength at the ends and corners of the system.  Further, while the mechanism 184 is
described for use in relation to a rolling-type guide assembly, it may also be used in relation to a sliding-type guide assembly or other types of guide assemblies.
 Headboard and End Cap
 Flatbed trailers typically include a headboard such as headboard 26 shown in FIG. 1.  According to the present invention the headboard 26 may be extended to provide a convenient place to stow components of the cover system when not deployed.  As
depicted, the headboard extension extends longitudinally and rearwardly of the trailer.  The extension may include a rigid sidewall attached to each side of the headboard, and an arching rigid span extending between the two sidewalls.  Optionally, the
headboard may be provided with a door (not shown) to allow a user to enter the storage area thereof.
 Again, an important aspect of the invention is the conveniently removable nature of components of the cover system by persons standing adjacent to the trailer, e.g., the stakes 16, panels 18 and rails 22 or 22', as well as the tarp cover 24 and
bows 25 if the guide assemblies 132, 134 are not used for movably supporting the tarp cover.
 As discussed above, the rails 22, 22' may be detached by releasing the rail locking mechanism 96 then removed and stored on the trailer.  Depending on length(s) of the rails, they may be stored at various positions on the trailer, including
within the space enclosed by the headboard and/or a space defined at a lower portion of the trailer, e.g., adjacent a longitudinally extending frame of the trailer.  According to another aspect of the invention, the panels 18 and stakes 16 may be
conveniently stored within the headboard, using an arrangement as shown in FIG. 20.  Particularly, half of the panels 18 may be stored face-to-face on one side of the headboard, the other half of the panels may be similarly stored on the other side of
the headboard, and then an appropriate mechanism is used to maintain the panels in such storage positions.  As depicted, such a mechanism may include a rod 158 having one end secured/securable to the headboard, e.g., the end is hooked and is pivotally
associated with a ring or bar 160 fixed to the headboard, the other end of the rod may be threaded and a large flat washer 162 and a wing nut 164 placed over the threaded end and manipulated until the panels are securely clamped between the washer 162
and the headboard.  The stakes 16 may also be disposed in a vertical, side-to-side arrangement between the panels and the headboard 26, and commonly clamped with the panels between the washer 162 and the headboard.  If the bows 25 are removed, they may
also be conveniently stored within the headboard, e.g., within the arched upper portion thereof using appropriate securing mechanism(s).
 As depicted, the end cap 28 may also be included with the cover system and may be substantially arch-shaped, and removably attached to the upper ends of the rear stakes and/or to the rear, transversely extending rail 22.  For example, an
attachment hole may be formed into the rail on both sides of the end cap and bracket(s) may be provided for each side of the end cap that can be attached by a bolt or other fastener to the attachment holes in the rails.
 Referring to FIGS. 28-32A, there is shown another embodiment of a cover system cover according to the present invention mounted on a flatbed trailer 12 which is different from the system 10 of FIG. 1 relative to the structure of the headboard
226 and rear end structure thereof, and because the system does not include upper rails such as rails 22 in FIG. 1 or a retractable tarp cover, but instead includes bows having ends which are directly supported by the upper end of stakes 216 and a tarp
cover which is provided over the bows and secured to the stakes without the use of conventional elastic straps and rope.  The system without the tarp cover and bows is shown mounted on a truck trailer in FIG. 28.
 As shown best in FIG. 31, the headboard 226 may include an extension 228' extending a short distance, e.g., one or two feet, rearwardly from the headboard at both sides thereof.  The headboard extension 228' provides extra space for storing or
securing components of the cover system when the components are not being used in operative positions thereof.  Also, the extension may include a panel-retaining slot 227 on either side thereof for receiving and retaining a front edge of the front panels
218 at the sides of the trailer.
 With reference to FIGS. 32, 32A there is shown a structure for connecting a tarp cover, not shown but substantially corresponding to the cover 24, to the headboard 226.  The structure may include a tarp edge securing member 260 and a latch
mechanism 242 for securing the securing member to the headboard.  The securing member may comprise an aluminum extrusion having an elongate central portion which extends horizontally along the rear edge of the headboard 226 and end portions which curve
and extend downwardly a short distance from the central portion, and wherein the central and end portions have a groove 241 defined therein.  The groove is adapted to receive an enlarged edge of the tarp cover similar to the groove 98 discussed in
relation to FIG. 19 above, although the groove 241 has a single lobe for receiving a single edge of the tarp cover.  Similar to retaining groove 98 in FIG. 19, the groove 241 slidingly receives and retains an enlarged front edge of the tarp cover such
that the edge will not be displaced from the groove during normal operation of the system due to forces in the longitudinal direction of the trailer.  Of course, the tarp edge may be intentionally slid out of the groove 241 for repair or any other reason
if desired.  The latch mechanism 242 may include a projecting member that extends beneath the securing member 260 and has a curved end 243 that is shaped to securely receive the rear edge of the securing member.  The projecting member may be movable and
latchable relative to the headboard such that an operator can readily secure and detach the tarp edge securing member relative to the headboard by manipulating the latch mechanism.  A plurality of the latch mechanisms 242 may be used to collectively
secure the tarp edge securing member 260.
 An alternative mechanism for securing the front end of the tarp cover to the headboard is shown in FIGS. 33, 33A.  In this embodiment, the headboard 226 has a recess 251 formed near a rear end thereof, while the front edge of the tarp cover (not
shown in this figure) may be enlarged by enclosing a piece of rope or tubing therein and is adapted to be received in the recess 251.  Further, opposite sides of the tarp cover 20 have pockets formed therein which hang down laterally over the opposite
sides of the headboard, such as the pockets 222 shown in FIGS. 24, 24A, 24B and latch mechanisms 254 are provided at opposite sides of the headboard which may be manipulated from inside of the headboard to operatively engage the pockets and retain them
closely to the sides of the headboard, and thereby also securely retain the front edge of the tarp cover in the recess 251.  Each latch mechanism may include a pivot shaft 253 which extends through the recess 251 and is fixed to the headboard, a
pocket-gripping member 255 connected to the pivot shaft and extending outwardly of the headboard, and a handle 256 also connected to the pivot shaft and extending inwardly of the headboard.  In use, a pocket of the tarp cover is disposed over the
corresponding pocket-gripping member 255, the handle is pivoted upwardly, which causes the pocket-gripping member 255 to pivot downwardly together with the pocket closely against the side of the headboard.  This process is then repeated for the latch
mechanism on the other side of the trailer, which draws the front edge of the tarp cover laterally and downward at the opposite sides of the trailer.  Thus, the enlarged edge of the tarp cover is securely retained in the recess 251, and the opposite
sides of the front edge of the side cover are securely retained against the sides of the headboard.  This makes the front portion of the tarp cover aerodynamic relative to the headboard, and also gives the cover system an aesthetic appearance.  As with
the latches shown in FIGS. 23-25, the latch mechanisms 254 which are at the rearmost and/or front most positions at the two sides of the trailer, may be constructed with an off-axis pivot axis such that tension will be applied to the tarp when the latch
mechanisms are closed.  The latch mechanism may also have a locking device to hold the mechanism in the operative latched position thereof.  Also, the headboard and the front-most bow may be somewhat smaller in height than the rest of the bows so that
the front end of the tarp cover tapers downwardly to the headboard for further improved aerodynamics.
 As an alternative to securing the front edge of the tarp cover in the slot 251, a clamping mechanism (not shown) may be provided which securely clamps an enlarged front edge of the tarp cover between a rear upper surface of the headboard and a
movable member which can be locked in a clamping position adjacent the headboard with the tarp edge secured therebetween.  Such clamping mechanism could also be used together with the latch mechanisms 254.
 Referring to FIGS. 29A-29C, the rear portion of the cover system may include: an enhanced rearmost bow 265', brace plates 218' of aluminum or other appropriate material connected between the rearmost bow 265' and the next adjacent bow 265, and
tensioning mechanisms 250 operatively connecting the rearmost bow 265' to the rear corner stakes 316.  The rearmost bow 265 may include a pair of individual bows 265 coupled together with connectors 228 formed of metal such as steel or aluminum.  The
brace plates 218' may be detachably or permanently connected to the endmost and next adjacent stakes 316 and, as previously discussed, the rearmost stake may be formed with enhanced strength and rigidity.  The tensioning mechanism 230 may include housing
231, a screw shaft 233 operatively disposed in the housing for rotation relative thereto, and a bow carrier 234 which operatively interconnects the ends of the rearmost bow 225' to the screw shaft 233 for movement relative thereto.  The housing 231 may
be formed of steel, aluminum or other appropriate materials and may include one or more insert posts 252 extending from a rear bottom portion thereof that are adapted to be operatively received within appropriately sized openings formed in the upper end
of the rearmost stake 316 or in a cap provided in the upper end of the stake, as well as an elongate opening 231' in an upper surface thereof.  The screw shaft 233 may be formed of hardened steel or other appropriate materials, and may include a head
portion 233' projecting from one end of the housing such that an operator may readily rotate the shaft 233 by manipulating a socket or wrench relative to the head portion 233'.  The bow carrier 234 may include a support plate 235 which extends through
the opening 231' and has threaded projections extending from a lower surface thereof and which operatively engage the screw shaft 233.  The carrier 234 may also include receivers 261 which securely receive the ends of the rearmost bow 265'.  With such
structure, when the shaft is rotated in one direction the carrier 234 moves rearwardly relative to the housing 231 thereby tensioning a tarp cover (not shown) supported by and connected to the bows, and when the shaft is rotated in the opposite
direction, the carrier moves forwardly relative to the housing 231 to relieve tension on the tarp cover.  The provision of the tensioning mechanism is very advantageous for achieving better aerodynamics, appearance and longevity for the cover system.
 Referring to FIGS. 29D-29F there is shown another embodiment of the rear portion of the cover system according to the invention including a different tensioning mechanism and a different rear-most bow than those shown in FIGS. 29A-29C.  The
rear-most bow 325 is shown in FIG. 29D and is different from the bow 265' in FIG. 29B in that it integrally includes pivoting latch mechanisms 330 at opposite ends thereof, as well as lower projecting members 339 at the opposite ends thereof which
function together with the tensioning mechanisms 350 shown in FIGS. 29E, 29F, but does not integrally include a tensioning mechanism such as mechanism 250 shown in FIGS. 29B, 29C.  Each of the latch mechanisms 330 is pivotally connected to one end of the
bow 325, includes a securing member 330' at the outside of the bow which fits in a pocket formed in the tarp cover such as the pocket 222 described above, and a handle at the inside of the bow which can be manipulated by an operator for engaging and
disengaging the latch mechanism.  The latch mechanism may also include an appropriate locking device (not shown) for maintaining the locking mechanism in its operative, latched position, e.g., a spring-biased catch which engages an opening formed in the
bow.  While a pair of tensioning mechanism is used to support the opposite ends of the rear-most bow 325, the following discussion only discusses one mechanism but the structure of the other mechanism is the same.
 As best shown in FIGS. 29E, 29F the tensioning mechanism 350 may be disposed at a lateral side of a trailer adjacent the rear-most stake 16 and a rear door 212.  The tensioning mechanism may be an over-center cam type mechanism as shown, and may
generally include a lower portion 351 which can be removably fixed to the trailer, e.g., at the lateral side of the trailer outwardly of the flatbed surface and inwardly of the rearmost stake 16, using appropriate fasteners such as bolts, an upper
portion 354 having its lower end pivotally connected to the upper end of the lower portion and which includes an opening 355 at the upper end thereof into which the projecting member 339 of the latch mechanism 330 can be securely inserted, and a cam
mechanism interconnecting the upper and lower portions.  In such position at the lateral side of the trailer outwardly of the flatbed surface, the tensioning mechanism desirably does not interfere with loads supported on the flatbed surface.  All
portions of the tensioning mechanism may be constructed of steel, aluminum or other appropriate materials.  The cam mechanism may include a handle 358 having one end pivotally connected to the upper portion 354 and an opposite free end which can be
gripped and manipulated by an operator, and a link member 360 pivotally connected between an intermediate part of the handle and the lower portion 351.  The lower portion may be adjustably fixed to the trailer such that its position on the trailer can be
adjusted in the longitudinal direction of the trailer if desired, e.g., if the tarp cover stretches over time.
 In operation, once the tensioning mechanism 350 is fixed to the trailer, the projecting member 339 of the latch mechanism 330 is inserted into the opening 355 at the upper end of the upper portion 354 and the operator pushes downwardly on the
handle 358 such that the upper portion pivots rearwardly to a substantially upright position thereof, and whereby the rear-most bow 325 and the tarp cover secured to the bow are also pulled rearwardly tensioning the tarp cover.  Again, tensioning of the
tarp is very desirable because it makes the system more aerodynamic and watertight, and increases the durability of the tarp cover because it is not flapping in the wind etc. As shown in FIG. 29F the tensioning mechanism 350 permits a relatively large
pivoting movement of the of the upper portion 354, e.g., through approximately 20-35.degree..  The overall height of the tensioning mechanism 350 may be substantially he same as the rear-most stake 16, e.g., approximately four (4) feet, such that the
actual pivoting distance through which the upper portion moves may be six-twelve inches or more, which can impose significant tension on the tarp cover.  When the handle 358 is moved to its lowest position, corresponding to the substantially upright
position of the upper portion 354 of the tensioning mechanism, the handle may lock into such position by the several forces acting thereon.  For removing tension on the tarp cover the operator simply pulls upwardly on the handle 358.
 For added stability at the rear end of the cover system a brace (not shown) may be provided which extends between the upper ends of the rear-most stakes 16 at the opposite sides of the trailer.  For example, a elongate brace could be provided
with downward projections at the opposite ends thereof which may be inserted into and securely retained in upper openings 361 formed at the upper ends of the stakes.
 Referring to FIGS. 30A, 30B the rear-hinged doors 212 facilitate loading and unloading of cargo at the rear end of the cover system.  The doors may include hinges 213 detachably supporting the doors to rearmost stakes 316, a securing latch 214
which operatively latches to the end of the trailer, and handles 215 for facilitating manipulation of the doors, and may also be used for securing the doors in open positions thereof.
 The present invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the dispositions of the components set forth in the foregoing description or illustrated in the appended drawings in association with the present
exemplary embodiments of the invention.  The present invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.  In addition, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the
purposes of illustration and example, and should not be regarded as limiting.
 As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the concepts, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the
present invention.  It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions.  For example, the stakes and retaining pockets according to the invention may be used to support panels other than on a trailer, e.g.,
they may be used to support clear plastic panels surrounding a hockey rink.  In such application, the stakes may be disposed opposite to the disposition on a trailer, i.e., the surfaces of the clear plastic panels facing inwardly of the hockey rink would
be substantially flush with the outer surface of the stake section facing inwardly of the rink.
 Although the present invention has been described herein with respect to a number of specific illustrative embodiments, the foregoing description is intended to illustrate, rather than to limit the invention.  Those skilled in the art will
realize that many modifications of the preferred embodiment could be made which would be operable.  All such modifications, which are within the scope of the claims, are intended to be within the scope and spirit of the present invention.

 The present invention relates generally to a protective cover system for a trailer such as a fifth wheel camper that is hauled behind a vehicle.  More particularly, the present application involves a protective cover system with a cover that can
be raised and lowered with respect to a front surface of the trailer and that is removable and easily washable.
BACKGROUND
 Trailers, such as fifth wheel trailers, are used for utility and recreational activities.  For example, camping trailers are transported by a family via their truck or car to a campsite where they are subsequently used for sleeping, cooking, or
storage purposes.  During transport, trailers are of a height that may be higher than that of the pulling vehicle.  Further, the front surface of trailers can be set some distance behind the pulling vehicle.  The arrangement of trailers with respect to
their pulling vehicle causes the front surface of the trailer to come into contact with wind, bugs, and debris that can strike or damage the front surface.
 Bug and debris impact onto the front surface of the trailer during transport may result in an undesirable appearance of the trailer once located at the campsite.  Upon setting up the trailer at the campsite, the family will have to look at the
dirty, damaged front surface of the trailer the entire time they are camping.  Once finished, the front surface of the trailer will become even more dirty and damaged upon transport back from the campsite to the family's home.  The family may be too
tired after their camping trip to want to clean and/or repair the front surface of the trailer after getting home.  This may result in permanent damage or discoloration to the front surface aside from causing it to be unsightly for an extended period of
time.  Further, there is a large amount of effort needed to clean the front surface of the trailer due to its height and due to the material and shape making up this portion of the trailer.
 One device for preventing damage to a front surface of a trailer is known as a bug bra that is used to prevent impact of this area of the trailer from insects and dirt.  The bra is made of vinyl fabric and is attached via mechanical fasteners to
trim located on the side of the trailer and along the upper surface of the trailer.  Although capable of preventing damage to a trailer surface, the bug bra is difficult to install because the user must access the upper surface of the trailer which may
require a ladder or other device.  Further, placement of the bug bra on the surface of the trailer will itself leave a mark as it is not easily removable from the surface.
 A different device known for use with a trailer involves an inflatable body that is located on the front surface of the trailer for aerodynamic advantage to reduce wind resistance to the trailer and improve fuel economy.  This arrangement
requires a pair of mounting poles that are vertically oriented to prevent lateral movement of the inflatable body.  A single pulley system is used to pull the inflatable body into position on the trailer that includes a line that extends across the
entire lateral length of the inflatable body and a winch that is used to draw this line.  Although capable of improving aerodynamic properties of the trailer, the inflatable body is not designed for reducing impacts to the front surface of the trailer
and is not easily removable or washable.  Further, the hoisting mechanism is complex in nature and requires components only on the front surface of the trailer thus limiting its functionality and performance.  As such, there remains room for variation
and improvement in the art. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF REPRESENTATIVE EMBODIMENTS
 Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings.  Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, and not meant as a limitation of the
invention.  For example, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield still a third embodiment.  It is intended that the present invention include these and other modifications and variations.
 It is to be understood that the ranges mentioned herein include all ranges located within the prescribed range.  As such, all ranges mentioned herein include all sub-ranges included in the mentioned ranges.  For instance, a range from 100-200
also includes ranges from 110-150, 170-190, and 153-162.  Further, all limits mentioned herein include all other limits included in the mentioned limits.  For instance, a limit of up to 7 also includes a limit of up to 5, up to 3, and up to 4.5.
 The present invention provides for a protective cover system 10 for a trailer 12 that functions to protect a front surface 32 of the trailer 12 from impact with debris during transport of the trailer 12 such as dirt, stones, bugs and the like. 
The protective cover system 10 includes a line 16 that can be used to reconfigure the cover 14 from a lowered position 18 on the trailer 12 to a raised position 20 onto the front surface 32 when transport of the trailer 12 is desired.  The line 16 can
also be used to move the cover 14 into the lowered position 18 when one desires to remove the cover 14 from the trailer 12.  The cover 14 may be completely detached from the trailer 12 and placed into a washing machine or otherwise cleaned to remove
impact debris in a faster and less labor intensive manner than it would take to clean such debris directly from the front surface 32.  Further, removal of the cover 14 while at the camp site may be desirable to the users since they will not have to view
debris impact on the trailer 12 or cover 14 while camping.  Aside from protecting the front surface 32 from debris impact that would otherwise permanently damage the front surface 32 or cause it to be unsightly, the cover 14 may be provided with indicia
68 that provides individual expression for the user and a unique feature to the trailer 12 during transport and during camping should the cover 14 be kept in the raised position 20 during camping.  The protective cover system 10 may be provided with a
line guard 44 that functions to protect the line 16 during transport and prevent the line 16 from being entangled with other items both when camping and when the trailer 12 is in motion.
 With reference to FIG. 1, a front view of the protective cover system 10 is shown with the cover 14 in a raised position 20 on the front surface 32 of the trailer 12.  A hook 82 is mounted onto the trailer 12 through any means such as adhesion
or mechanical fasteners, and an elastic band 84 is looped onto the hook 82 and remains attached thereto while the cover 14 is in the raised position 20.  The cover 14 has on its lower end a lower grommet 80 through which the elastic band 84 is disposed
and retained via a ball 86 that is larger than the size of the lower grommet 80 and cannot move through the lower grommet 80.  This arrangement may be used to retain the lower end of the cover 14 to the trailer 12.  The elastic band 84 may be in tension
when the cover 14 is in the raised position 20.  Tension in the line 16 and in the elastic band 84 functions to pull the cover 14 taunt against the front surface 32.
 The cover 14 has a front surface 70 that includes indicia 68.  The indicia 68 may be markings indicative of a state flag, sports team or nation.  The indicia 68 may be of any design and may be in any color and may allow for individual expression
of the user and can provide a unique and aesthetically pleasing element to the trailer 12 during transport, storage and camping.  The cover 14 may thus be configured as a flag in certain embodiments, but it is to be understood that the indicia 68 need
not be present on the cover 14 in other embodiments.  Although as described as being located on the front surface 70, indicia 68 could in addition be located on the back surface of the cover 14 in other arrangements.  In this regard, the user may rotate
the cover 14 so that the indicia 68 located on the back surface of the cover 14 is displayed to give the user a second option for display purposes.  Regardless of whether the cover 14 is clean or dirty, the cover 14 may remain in the raised position 20
when camping to allow the indicia 68 to be displayed while the trailer 12 is parked and used for camping purposes.
 The front surface 32 of the trailer 12 is the surface of the trailer 12 that faces the direction of travel of the trailer 12 during transport.  The front surface 32 may include portions that are not covered by the cover 14 when the cover 14 is
in the raised position 20.  For example, portions of the front surface 32 located proximate to a trailer hitch 88 that is used to connect to the pulling vehicle are not covered by the cover 14.  These portions of the front surface 32 may be less
susceptible to impact from debris during transport due to their location relative to the pulling vehicle in a vertical direction 26.  However, it is to be understood that these portions of the front surface 32 may in fact be contacted with debris and
become damaged or unsightly in certain versions of the protective cover system 10.  In yet other arrangements, the cover 14 can be made large enough to cover all of the front surface 32 to prevent the entire front surface 32 from being damaged.  As such,
it is to be understood that the cover 14 when in the raised position 20 may be arranged to protect some of or all of the front surface 32 of the trailer 12.
 In the embodiment shown, the protective cover system 10 includes a line 16, a block 38, a guide member 42, line guard 44 and a cam cleat 54 located outboard from a portion of a side surface 30 of the trailer 12 in the lateral direction 24.  It
is to be understood that although described as being located outboard from the trailer 12 in the lateral direction 24, the portions of the protective cover system 10 need only be located outboard from certain portions of the side surface 30 of the
trailer 12 and need not be located outboard from the entire side surface 30 of the trailer 12 in the lateral direction 24.
 The line 16 has a lower terminal end 58 onto which a pull ring 56 is located.  When the cover 14 is in the raised position 20, the pull ring 56 may be located below the line guard 44 and the cam cleat 54 in a vertical direction 26 of the trailer
12.  The vertical direction 26 is the up down direction of the trailer 12 with respect to the ground 90 onto which the trailer 12 is located.  The pull ring 56 may be the lowest portion of the protective cover system 10 in the vertical direction 26.  The
line 16 can be pulled tight when the cover 14 is in the raised position 20 so that there is no slack in the line 16 between the cover 14 and the cam cleat 54.  In fact, in some exemplary embodiments, the line 16 can be tensioned from the cover 14 to the
cam cleat 54 so that this portion of the line 16 is slightly elongated.  However, it is to be understood that in accordance with other exemplary embodiments that the line 16 can have slack thereto at any portion along the length of the line 16.
 FIG. 2 is a front view of the trailer 12 when the cover 14 is reconfigured into the lowered position 18.  As shown, the line 16 is attached to an upper end of the cover 14 and is itself reconfigured when the cover 14 moves from the raised
position 20 into the lowered position 18 of FIG. 2.  The lower terminal end 58 of the line 16 and the pull ring 56 are moved upwards in the vertical direction 26 and are higher than certain portions of the protective cover system 10 in the vertical
direction 26 such as portions of the line guard 44.  When lowering the cover 14 into the lowered position 18, the line 16 moves past a ring 40 of a block 38 and may be positioned so as to be located forward of the front surface 32 in a longitudinal
direction 22.  The user may simply allow the cover 14 to fall in the vertical direction 26 via gravity and not hold the line 16 when lowering the cover 14.  In other arrangements, the user may push or assist the cover 14 in moving from the raised
position 20 to the lowered position 18.  In this regard, the user can hold both the line 16 and push the cover 14 simultaneously so that the cover 14 is lowered in a controlled manner to the lowered position 18.  It is therefore the case that gravity
and/or force applied by the user may be used to move the cover 14 from the raised position 20 to the lowered position 18.
 Once in the lowered position 18, the cover 14 may be more easily removed from the trailer 12.  The line 16 may be detached from the cover 14.  When the cover 14 is in the lowered position 18, the elastic band 84 may no longer be in tension and
can be more easily removed from the hook 82.  In other embodiments, the elastic band 84 may first be removed from the hook 82, even if under tension, and then subsequently the line 16 can be detached from the cover 14.  The cover 14 can then be stored or
washed as desired.  The elastic band 84 can be subsequently removed from the cover 14 once the cover 14 is removed from the trailer 12 for washing or storage purposes.  Cover 14 may be removed from the trailer 12 and placed into a washing machine in
order to clean bug residue and debris therefrom.  This cleaning of the cover 14 will require much less effort than scrubbing and washing the front surface 32 of the trailer 12.
 In order to raise the cover 14 from the lowered position 18 to the raised position 20, the cover 14 is first attached to the line 16 and to the hook 82 if not already attached.  The user may grasp the pull ring 56 and apply force downward in the
vertical direction 26 in order to move the lower terminal end 58 of the line 16 downward in the vertical direction 26.  This movement in turn causes the line 16 to pull on the upper end of the cover 14 so that the cover 14 is likewise pulled upwards
along the front surface 32 of the trailer 12 in the vertical direction 26.  Depending upon the exact configuration of the cover 14, line 16 and front surface 32, the cover 14 may also move in the lateral direction 24 upon being reconfigured from the
lowered position 18 to the raised position 20.  The user may simply apply downward force to the lower terminal end 58 of the line 16 to cause the cover 14 to move to the raised position 20, or the user may simultaneously apply this force to the line 16
while also applying force to the cover 14 to pull the cover 14 upwards in the vertical direction 26 and/or guide the cover 14 into the raised position 20.  The cover 14 can be moved upwards to such a state that the elastic band 84 is moved into tension
upon the cover 14 reaching the raised position 20.
 FIG. 3 is a top view of the trailer 12 with the cover 14 in the raised position 20.  The cover 14 extends over the front surface 32 of the trailer 12 and onto an upper surface 34 of the trailer 12.  The front surface 32 has a curvature, and the
upper surface 34 begins where the curvature of the front surface 32 ends such that the upper surface 34 is entirely flat.  An upper surface boundary line 94 is shown to denote the boundary between the upper surface 34 and the front surface 32.  Although
described as being separated upon the point of curvature of the front surface 32, it is to be understood that in accordance with other exemplary embodiments of the protective cover system 10, that the upper surface 34 may include portions that are curved
and need not be entirely flat.  Further, the front surface 32 may include flat portions as well as curved portions in other arrangements.  In accordance with one exemplary embodiment, the upper surface 34 includes all portions of the trailer 12 that are
visible from a top view such that no portion of the front surface 32 is visible in a top view.
 The cover 14 includes an upper grommet 62 at its upper end.  The line 16 may be directly attached to the upper grommet 62 by way of threading the line 16 through the upper grommet 62 and securing the line with a knot or other means of
attachment.  In the embodiment shown, an attachment member 66, that may be a dip, is used to attach the line 16 to the upper grommet 62.  The attachment member 66 may be a clip that is capable of being opened and disposed into the upper grommet 62 and
snapped shut for secure attachment thereto.  The line 16 may be permanently attached to the attachment member 66 to effect connection to the cover 14.  In other arrangements, the line 16 is not permanently attached to the attachment member and may be
attached to the attachment member 66 by way of a knot or other engagement.  The attachment member 66 may be made out of any material and in some arrangements may be made out of a softer material or may have a soft exterior surface so as to prevent
scratching and damage to the surface of the trailer 12.  Although shown as employing an attachment member 66, it is to be understood that the protective cover system 10 need not include an attachment member 66 in other embodiments and that the line 16
can be connected to the cover 14 in a variety of manners.
 The upper terminal end of the line 16 is located rearward of the upper surface boundary line 94 in the longitudinal direction 22 and is located inboard of the right side surface 30 of the trailer 12 in the lateral direction 24.  The line 16
extends from this point rearward in the longitudinal direction 22 and outboard in the lateral direction 24.  It is therefore the case that portions of the protective cover system 10 may be located in the vertical direction 26 above the upper surface 34
when the cover 14 is in the raised position 20.  Elements that may be so arranged include portions of the line 16, the upper grommet 62, portions of the cover 14 and the attachment number 66.  Other elements of the protective cover system 10 may be
located in the vertical direction 26 above the upper surface 34 in other arrangements.  However, it is to be understood that other exemplary embodiments of the protective cover system 10 exist in which no portion of the protective cover system 10 is
located above the upper surface 34 in the vertical direction 26 such that they are both higher than the upper surface 34 in the vertical direction 26 and simultaneously inboard of the side surface 30 in the lateral direction 24.
 A block 38 that includes a ring 40 is attached to the right side surface 30 and is located outboard from the right side surface 30 in the lateral direction 24.  The block 38 is rigidly attached to the trailer 12 such that its position does not
move relative to the trailer 12.  Ring 40 is rigidly attached to block 38 and the position of ring 40 does not change relative to the trailer 12.  The line 16 extends outboard in the lateral direction 24 and through the ring 40.  The line guard 44 is
likewise located outboard of the right side surface 30 in the lateral direction 24 and is itself attached to the right side surface 30.  The block 38 with attached ring 40 and the line guard 44 are located rearward of the upper surface boundary line 94,
and hence rearward of the front surface 32, in the longitudinal direction 22.  In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, no portion of the line 16 is located forward of the upper surface boundary line 94 in the longitudinal direction 22.  As such, the
entire line 16 is located rearward of the front surface 32 in the longitudinal direction 22.  However, it is to be understood that in accordance with other exemplary embodiments of the protective cover system 10 that portions of line 16 may be located
forward of the upper surface boundary line 94 in the longitudinal direction 22 when the cover 14 is in the lowered position 18 and when the cover 14 is in the raised position 20.
 FIG. 4 is a side elevation view of the trailer 12 with the protective cover system 10 in the raised position 20 of the cover 14.  As shown, the line 16 extends downward in the vertical direction 26 from the block 38 and does not move in the
longitudinal direction 22 from the block 38 to the lower terminal end 58.  The cam cleat 54 is attached to the right side surface 30 and the line 16 is arranged so that it is disposed through the cam cleat 54 when the cover 14 is in the raised position
20.  The cam cleat 54 can be attached to the right side surface 30 through double-sided tape, adhesives, mechanical fasteners, or hook and loop type fasteners.  The cam cleat 54 functions to lock the position of the line 16 so that the line 16 cannot
move upwards in the vertical direction 26.  The weight of the cover 14 acts to pull the line 16 upwards in the vertical direction 26 and thus the cam cleat 54 prevents this upward motion and functions to lock the line 16 in place.  As there is no force,
and relatively zero weight, acting on the line 16 downward in the vertical direction 26, the line 16 will not move downward relative to the cam cleat 54.
 The line 16 may be pulled through the cam cleat 54 so that it is tightly tensioned such that no slack in the line 16 is present from the cam cleat 54 up to the attachment with the cover 14.  Tightening of the line 16 in this manner may function
to more securely fasten the cover 14 to the trailer 12 and prevent movement or unwanted disturbance of the cover 14 during transport.  The portion of line 16 below the cam cleat 54 in the vertical direction 26 and the pull ring 56 may not be attached to
any other portion of the protective cover system 10 or trailer 12.  However, in some embodiments, the pull ring 56 and/or line 16 could be secured to prevent them from moving or otherwise being entangled with other components.
 The line 16 extends completely through the line guard 44 in the vertical direction 26 from the upper end of the line guard 44 to the lower end of the line guard 44.  With reference back to FIG. 3, the line guard 44 includes a front surface 46,
an outboard surface 48, and an inboard surface 52.  The line 16 is located within a cavity 60 defined by the surfaces of the line guard 44.  An open back 50 is present in the line guard 44 for use in accessing the line 16 as will be momentarily
described.  Forward movement of the trailer 12 in the longitudinal direction 22 will cause wind forces to be imparted onto the line 16 as the line 16 is at least partially located outboard of the right side surface 30.  The front surface 46 functions to
block wind, debris, and other forces from the line 16.  The outboard surface 48 also functions to block wind, debris and other forces from the line 16 to prevent or minimize damage to the line 16 and detachment or unwanted movement of the line 16.
 With reference to FIG. 3, in accordance with other exemplary embodiments, the inboard surface 52 need not be present.  Instead, the front surface 46 may be directly attached to the right side surface 30 and the outboard surface 48 may extend
therefrom.  Alternatively, the line guard 44 can be provided with the front surface 46 but not the outboard surface 48.  In these instances, the front surface 46 may be directly attached to the right side surface 30 or the inboard surface 52 can be
present and may be attached to the right side surface 30.
 The cover 14 can be located in the raised position 20 so that it does not cover any portion of the side surface 30.  In other embodiments, the cover 14 may in fact cover some portion of the side surface 30 when the cover 14 is in the raised
position 20.
 The guide member 42 is located above the line guard 44 in the vertical direction 26, and the block 38 is located above the guide member 42 in the vertical direction 26.  The block 38 and guide member 42 can be attached to the right side surface
30 in a variety of manners.  For example, they may be attached through adhesion, mechanical fasteners, hook and loop type fasteners, or other means in accordance with different exemplary embodiments.
 The longitudinal direction 22 is the front to back direction of the trailer 12 and would be the direction of travel of the trailer 12 as it is being pulled by the towing vehicle.  The lateral direction 24 is perpendicular to the longitudinal
direction 22 and is the left/right or inboard/outboard direction of the trailer 12.  The vertical direction 26 is the up/down direction with respect to the ground 90 and is perpendicular to both the longitudinal direction 22 and the lateral direction 24.
 The bottom of the guide member 42 is shown in greater detail with reference to FIG. 6.  The guide member 42 may be an L-shaped member one face of which is attached to the right side surface 30 while the other face extends from the right side
surface 30 outboard in the lateral direction 24.  This face of the guide member 42 defines a slot 96 that is open on one end.  The slot 96 extends forward in the longitudinal direction 22 and the open portion of the slot 96 is located rearward in the
longitudinal direction 22.  The line 16 is located within the slot 96 and may engage the guide member 42 at the forward end of the slot 96.  The guide member 42 functions to prevent movement of the line 16 forward in the longitudinal direction 22.  The
guide member 42 may also provide some stabilization to the line 16 in the lateral direction 24.  As the slot 96 is open, the line 16 may be moved rearward in the longitudinal direction 22 and out of engagement with the guide member 42 in some
circumstances.  The guide member 42 may be made of a variety of materials such as steel, aluminum, plastic or the like.
 The block 38 extends from the right side surface 30 outboard in the lateral direction 24 and may include the ring 40 that forms a closed aperture through which the line 16 is disposed.  Although the line 16 is capable of moving through the ring
40 in the vertical direction 26, the closed nature of the ring 40 along with the block 38 limits movement of the line 16 in the longitudinal direction 22 and the lateral direction 24 so that the line 16 is constrained to the aperture defined by the block
38 and the ring 40.  The block 38 and ring 40 function to change the direction of travel of the line 16 so that upon downward movement of the lower terminal end 58 the line 16 above the block 38 and ring 40 will move outboard in the lateral direction 24
and rearward in the longitudinal direction 22 and upon traversing through the block 38 and ring 40 will no longer move in these directions but will instead move only in the vertical direction 26 downward.  However, it is to be understood that in other
exemplary embodiments that the line 16 may have components in the lateral direction 24 and longitudinal direction 22 at points below the block 38 and ring 40 in the vertical direction 26.
 The block 38 and ring 40 function to change the orientation of the line 16 to a desired position.  The entire block 38 and ring 40 may be located below the upper surface 34 in the vertical direction 26.  In accordance with other exemplary
embodiments, some or all of the block 38 and/or ring 40 are located above the upper surface 34 in the vertical direction 26.
 With reference to FIG. 5, a side view of the trailer 12 of FIG. 4 is shown in which the protective cover system 10 has been moved into the lowered position 18 of the cover 14.  The lower terminal end 58 and the pull ring 56 are located
vertically above the cam cleat 54 and are within the line guard 44 in the vertical direction 26.  In accordance with other exemplary embodiments, the lower terminal end 58 and the pull ring 56 may be located at the guide member 42 and may in fact engage
the guide member 42 to prevent further upward movement of these components in the vertical direction 26.  The orientation of the line 16 is further changed in that upon exiting the ring 40 the line 16 does not extend vertically above the upper surface 34
but is instead located entirely below the upper surface 34 in the vertical direction 26.  The line 16 extends to the attachment member 66 and may wraparound a portion of the front surface 32 so as to be located longitudinally in front of the front
surface 32 and may be located in the lateral direction 24 in board of the right side surface 30.  In other embodiments, the line 16 may not be located inboard of the right side surface 30 in the lateral direction 24.
 The cover 14 may be made of a flexible material and may be air permeable.  In this regard, the cover 14 can be capable of being folded onto itself multiple times and may be bunched up into a position, for example, as shown in FIG. 5.  The cover
14 may allow air to flow therethrough such that the cover 14 is made of a material that cannot contain air and thus cannot be inflated.  The cover 14 in certain exemplary embodiments may be made of a single layer of material and may not be an inflatable
member.  Tension in the elastic band 84 may be removed when the cover 14 is in the lowered position 18 to allow the elastic band 84 to more easily be removed from the hook 82 than when in the tensioned state.
 FIGS. 7 and 8 show an alternative exemplary embodiment of the protective cover system 10 from that previously illustrated.  With reference first to FIG. 7, a grasping line 92 is attached to the pull ring 56 and may be either attached to the
trailer 12 to prevent it from moving or can be unattached to the trailer 12 and allowed to move if desired.  The line guard 44 is arranged in a different manner from that previously described, and a pull ring stop 74 is located at the top of the line
guard 44 in the vertical direction 26.  An aperture 76 extends through the pull ring stop 74 and the line 16 in turn extends through both the aperture 76 and the line guard 44.  The guide member 42 is not present, and the block 38 is arranged in a
different manner from that previously described.  The block 38 is completely located below the upper surface 34 in the vertical direction 26, but as previously described some or all of the block 38 could be located above the upper surface 34 in the
vertical direction 26 in other arrangements.  The line 16 is arranged in a similar manner to that previously described in that the line 16 may move downward in the vertical direction 26 to the block 38, rearward in the longitudinal direction 22 to the
block 38, and in some arrangements outboard in the lateral direction 24 to the block 38.  Upon exiting the block 38, the line 16 moves vertically downward in the vertical direction 26 and its orientation in the longitudinal direction 22 and the lateral
direction 24 may not change from this point all the way to the lower terminal end 58.
 FIG. 8 shows the protective cover system 10 of FIG. 7 in which the cover 14 is moved into the lowered position 18.  The lower terminal end 58 and the pull ring 56 are located at the upper portion of the line guard 44.  Upward movement of the
pull ring 56 and hence the lower terminal end 58 in the vertical direction 26 is prevented due to contact between the pull ring 56 and the pull ring stop 74.  The aperture 76 although large enough to allow the line 16 to move therethrough is of a size
and/or shape that does not allow the pull ring 56 to move therethrough.  As such, the pull ring 56 is prevented from moving in the vertical direction 26 beyond the pull ring stop 74.  In use, when the pull ring 56 is moving upwards in the vertical
direction 26 a controlled movement may be affected by holding the pull ring 56 or other component of the protective cover system 10 so that the pull ring 56 does not impact the pull ring stop 74 with a sufficient amount of force.  In other arrangements,
the pull ring 56 may be released and can engage the pull ring stop 74 with a high amount of force such as would be the case should the cover 14 be made of a heavy material and/or soaked with rain.  The connection between the lower terminal end 58 and
pull ring 56, along with the attachment of the pull ring stop 74 and the line guard 44 may be made so as to be robust enough to handle such an engagement.
 The line guard 44 in the currently discussed embodiment is shown in greater detail with respect to FIGS. 9-14.  The line guard 44 includes a front surface 46 that extends in the vertical direction 26 and from which the outboard surface 48 and
the inboard surface 52 extend so as to form the right side and left side respectively of the line guard 44.  A back surface 72 extends from both the outboard surface 48 and the inboard surface 52.  An open back 50 is defined in the back surface 72 and is
open at the lower terminal end of the line guard 44.  The line guard 44 may be made of 7/8.sup.th square inch PVC tubing in accordance with one exemplary embodiment, and the open back 50 can be made by cutting out a portion of the back surface 72.  The
bottom terminal end of the line guard 44 is open both at the bottom as shown in FIG. 14, and at the back via the open back 50.  The surfaces 46, 48 and 52 may all be of the same size and shape in certain embodiments, or may be variously sized and shaped,
although shown as being planer surfaces, the surfaces of the line guard 44 need not be planer in accordance with other exemplary embodiments.
 The pull ring stop 74 engages the upper terminal end of the line guard 44 and as shown engages the front surface 46, outboard surface 48, inboard surface 52, and back surface 72.  The open back 50 may terminate at the pull ring stop 74 such that
the open back 50 forms a slot in the back surface 72 that is open at its bottom but closed at its top.  The cavity 60 may be defined by the various surfaces 46, 48, 52, and 72 of the line guard 44.  Although shown as having a square cross sectional
shape, the cavity 60 can be variously shaped in accordance with other exemplary embodiments.
 The pull ring stop 74 may be made of the same material as the line guard 44 and can be attached to the upper terminal end of the line guard 44 in a variety of manners.  For example, the pull ring stop 74 may be attached via adhesion, mechanical
fasteners, or in some circumstances may be integrally formed with the line guard 44 such that they are essentially a single piece.  The aperture 76 is shown as being circular but could be variously configured in other arrangements.  The aperture 76
extends completely through the pull ring stop 74 and is centered with respect to the cavity 60.  The pull ring stop 74 can be variously configured in accordance with other exemplary embodiments and need not engage the upper terminal end of the line guard
44 and instead may be a separate component or may be attached to the block 38.
 The block 38 of the exemplary embodiment shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 is illustrated in greater detail with reference to FIGS. 15-17.  The block 38 may include a molded component with an aperture 78 that extends therethrough.  The aperture 78 may
extend from one surface of the block 38 through the block 38 to a different surface of the block 38 that in some embodiments may be perpendicular to the first surface of the block 38.  The aperture 78 may have a circular cross section at all points along
its length or may have different cross-sectional shapes at different points along its length.  As shown, the aperture 78 in the exemplary embodiments of FIGS. 15-17 has a cross-sectional shape that varies along its length.
 The aperture 78 includes a conical portion 98 that extends from a surface of the block 38 to an interior location within the block 38.  The conical portion 98 has a larger diameter at the surface of the block 38 and the cross-sectional shape
decreases in size upon extension into the block 38.  With reference back to FIGS. 7 and 8, the conical portion 98 may accommodate the reorientation of the line 16 with respect to the lateral direction 24 and the vertical direction 26 due to
reconfiguration of the cover 14 between the lowered and raised positions 18 and 20.  In other embodiments, the aperture 78 need not have the conical portion 98 at this location and a circular cross-sectional shape may in fact accommodate reorientation of
the line 16 in the lateral direction 24 and vertical direction 26.  The aperture 78 extends from the conical portion 98 into a curved section 100.  The curved section 100 thus changes the direction of travel of the line 16 through the block 38 so that it
may in some instances move roughly 90.degree.  upon traveling through the curved section 100.  The curved section 100 can be shaped so as to provide a smooth transition for the line 16 through the block 38.  The curved section 100 may thus be sized and
shaped so that the line 16 does not become pinched and trapped within the aperture 78 when moving through the aperture 78.  The curved section 100 can extend from the conical portion 98 to the bottom surface of the block 38 or may extend to a point
within the interior of the block 38 at which point the aperture 78 extends in a straight direction to the bottom surface of the block 38.  As shown with reference to FIG. 17, the curved section 100 terminates before the bottom surface of the block 38 and
the remaining portion of the aperture 78 from the curved section 100 to the bottom surface of the block 38 is straight.
 The block 38 is arranged on the right side surface 30 of the trailer 12 so that the conical portion 98 forms an aperture on the front surface of the block 38 that faces forward in the longitudinal direction 22.  The aperture 78 extends through
the block 38 and forms an aperture at the bottom surface of the block 38 that faces downward in the vertical direction 26.  The block 38 is spaced from the pull ring stop 74 in the vertical direction 26 but may engage the pull ring stop 74 in other
embodiments.  In yet further arrangements, the block 38 and the pull ring stop 74 can be intricately formed with one another.  In yet additional exemplary embodiments of the protective cover system 10, the pull ring stop 74 need not be present, and the
block 38 can function as the pull ring stop 74 in that the pull ring 56 will not be able to fit through the aperture 78 and thus its movement in the vertical direction 26 or past the block 38 will be prevented.
 Modification of the protective cover system 10 so that the cover 14 is moved from the lowered position 18 to the raised position 20 may first require the user to obtain access to the line 16.  With reference to FIG. 8, the pull ring 56 may be
located at a height in the vertical direction 26 that cannot be reached by the user.  In these instances, the user may obtain an elongated hooking device commonly provided with trailers 12 that he or she may use to hook the pull ring 56 and draw it
downwards in the vertical direction 26 for subsequent grasping.  Alternatively, the grasping line 92 may be provided and may be attached to the pull ring 56.  As shown in FIG. 8, the grasping line 92 is at a height in the vertical direction 26 that can
be grasped by a user.  The user may pull the line 16 downward in the vertical direction 26 so that it moves through the line guard 44 in the vertical direction 26.
 The line 16 when being moved downward may also be moved in the longitudinal direction 22 rearward and may be removed from the line guard 44 via the open back 50.  Upon moving the line 16 in the vertical direction 26 downward past the cam cleat
54, the line 16 may be positioned outboard of the cam cleat 54 in the lateral direction 24.  The user may engage the line 16 with the cam cleat 54 and apply pressure both inboard in the lateral direction 24 and downward in the vertical direction 26 so
that the line 16 becomes attached to the cam cleat 54 and is capable of being held by the cam cleat 54.  If the line 16 and pull ring 56 are not in a desired position, the user may continue to pull the line 16 downward in the vertical direction 26 so
that the cover 14 is moved into the raised position 20 as desired.  The raising of the cover 14 may be effected completely through movement of the line 16, or the user may both move the line 16 and also manually position the cover 14 on the trailer 12. 
Once positioned, the user may release the line 16 and the cam cleat 54 may engage the line 16 and lock it thus preventing movement upwards in the vertical direction 26.  The line 16 when the cover 14 is in the raised position 20 is free to move downward
in the vertical direction 26 but is restrained from moving upwards in the vertical direction 26.
 In order to lower the cover 14 into the lowered position 18, the user will first grasp the line 16 or pull ring 56 and pull the line 16 downwards in the vertical direction 26.  This action will release the cam pressure of the cam cleat 54 on the
line 16.  Once released, the user may then pull the line 16 outboard in the lateral direction 24 in order to completely disengage the line 16 from the cam cleat 54.  It is to be understood that in other exemplary embodiments of the protective cover
system 10 that the cam cleat 54 can be arranged so that it is not on the right side surface 30 of the trailer 12.  In these instances, the line 16 will simply be moved in a direction perpendicular to the locking direction of the cam cleat 54 in order to
remove the line 16 therefrom.
 The line 16 is moved in a direction tangential to the direction of travel of the line 16 through the cam cleat 54 in order to remove the line 16 from the cam cleat 54.  This tangential direction may be in the longitudinal direction 22, lateral
direction 24, or in some other combination of these two directions 22 and 24 when the line 16 moves in the vertical direction 26 through the cam cleat 54.
 Once removed, the user may pull the pull ring 56 and line 16 rearward in the longitudinal direction 22 to cause it to be removed from the line guard 44 via the open back 50.  The user may then allow the line 16 and pull ring 56 to raise in the
vertical direction 26 while the pull ring 56 is outside of the line guard 44.  The user may assist the cover 14 manually as well to ensure that it is properly lowered from the raised position 20.  Once the pull ring 56 is moved vertically upwards, it may
be released at some point and allowed to move back into the line guard 44 through the open back 50 and can engage the pull ring stop 74 at the aperture 76.  The pull ring 56 and thus line 16 will be prevented from further upward movement at this point in
the vertical direction 26 and the cover 14 will be in the lowered position 18.
 Although described as being removed from the line guard 44 during raising and lowering of the cover 14, in other exemplary embodiments the line 16 remains within the line guard 44 at all times and is not removed through an open back 50. 
Further, although described as having a cam cleat 54, it is to be understood that this component need not be present in other exemplary embodiments.  Instead, the line 16 may be attached to a portion of the trailer 12 or to some other attachment member
of the protective cover system 10 that prevents movement of the line 16.
 With reference back to FIG. 1, a second set 102 of protective cover elements are shown and are associated with the left side surface 28 of the trailer 12.  The second set 102 can include the exact same elements as previously described with
respect to those elements of the protective cover system 10 associated with the right side surface 30.  In this regard, the second set 102 may include the line 16, line guard 44, block 38 and/or guide member 42, and a repeat of this information is not
necessary.  The second set 102 may be provided in the exact same manner as the first set associated with the right side surface 30, or various components of the second set 102 can be different from, additional to, or eliminated from those associated with
the right side surface 30.
 With reference to FIG. 2, the line 16 of the second set 102 is attached to the upper end of the cover 14 in the same manner as that associated with the upper grommet 62 and line 16 of the right side surface 30 elements.  A similar elastic band
84 and hook 82 arrangement can be used to attach a lower grommet to the cover 14 in relation to the second set 102 of protective cover elements.  In use, the user may first lower or raise the cover 14 with respect to the protective cover elements
associated with the right side surface 30, and then move over to the other side of the trailer 12 and raise or lower the cover 14 with the use of the second set 102.  In other exemplary embodiments, the user may partially raise or lower the cover 14 with
respect to one of the sets and then partially raise or lower the cover 14 with respect to the other set of protective cover elements.  However, it may be the case that in use, if two lines 16 are used to hold the cover 14 into the raised position 20,
release of tension or lowering of one of the lines 16 will not be sufficient to cause the cover 14 to move into the lowered position 18 because the other line 16 will still effect holding.  In these instances, the user may simply use one side of the
protective cover system 10 and then subsequently move to the second set 102 in order to fully lower the cover 14 into the lowered position 18.  The same may be true upon raising the cover 14 from the lowered position 18 to the raised position 20.  In
this regard, the use of a single line 16 may be sufficient to raise the cover 14 substantially into the raised position 20.  Use of the second set 102 will then fully complete configuration of the cover 14 to the raised position 20.
 Although shown and described as having two sets of protective cover elements, it may be the case that in certain exemplary embodiments only a single set of protective cover elements are present and the second set 102 is not present.  As such,
the protective cover system 10 can be located so that some or all of the components are located outboard of one of the side surfaces 28 or 30 but no components are located outboard of the other one of the side surfaces 28 or 30 in the lateral direction
24.  Further, in yet additional exemplary embodiments multiple sets of protective cover elements may be used in the protective cover system 10.
 The lines 16 are arranged so that they are not tied together.  In this regard, the line 16 associated with the first set of protective cover elements is completely separate from the line 16 associated with the second set 102 of protective cover
elements.  The line 16 associated with the right side surface 30 is separate from the line 16 associated with the second set 102 of protective cover elements at the left side surface 28.  These two lines 16 are separated from one another in the lateral
direction 24 and do not contact one another.  The line 16 does not extend across the entire lateral length of the cover 14 in the lateral direction 24 when the cover 14 is in the raised position 20.  As such, there is no line present at the lateral
midpoint of the cover 14 when in the raised position 20.
 The cover 14 is shown as having four grommets for use in securing the cover 14 to the trailer 12.  However, it is to be understood that any number of grommets that may be used in accordance with other exemplary embodiments.  For example, from
1-5, from 6-10, or up to 20 grommets and corresponding attachments can be used to effect the attachment of the cover 14 to the trailer 12.
 An alternative arrangement of the cover 18 is disclosed with reference to FIG. 18.  The cover 18 may be arranged the same as that previously disclosed and a repeat of this information is not necessary.  However, and extra extension portion 104
may extend from the upper edge of the cover 18 so that the cover 18 is higher than previous embodiments.  The extra extension portion 104 can form a portion of the front surface 70 and the indicia 68 may or may not be present on the front surface 70 of
the extension portion 104.  The extension portion 104 is spaced inwards from the two side edges of the cover 18 so that square or rectangular cut out type voids are present proximate to the upper corners of the cover 18.  The grommets 62 and 80 can be
located outboard from the extension portion 104 and may be below the cut out type voids in the left and right direction of the cover 14.  The extension portion 104 may extend from 6-8 inches in the height direction of the cover 14.  The extension portion
104 may allow for a better fit of the cover 14 and hence better protection of the upper portions of the trailer 12 due to the configurations of the upper surface 34 and front surface 32 of various trailer 12 types.
 Another alternative arrangement of the cover 14 is shown with reference to FIG. 19 in which the extension portion 104 is again present and may be from 6-8 inches in the height direction and located at the top of the cover 14 in order to extend
the height of the cover 14.  The extension portion 104 may again be provided to better protect the upper surface 34 and/or front surface 32 of certain types of trailers 12.  The indicia 68 may or may not be located in the extension portion 104.  The
extension portion 104 extends from one side of the cover 14 to the opposite side of the cover 14 and there are no cut out type voids present.  The extension portion 104 is above the grommets 62 and 80 in the height direction.
 The sides of the cover 14, that may or may not be reinforced, may be looped onto one another in order to form a pocket 106 as can be seen in FIG. 20.  The pocket 106 can be formed by one loop or up to 4 loops of the cover 14 onto itself in
various arrangements.  The pocket 106 may extend the entire vertical length of the cover 14 or may be less than the entire vertical length in various arrangements.  A rod 106 is located within the pocket 106 and may extend from the bottom, or from just
above the bottom, of the cover 14 to a point below the grommet 62 in the height direction.  In other arrangements, the rod 106 may extend vertically above the upper grommet 62 and even into the extension portion 104 in certain arrangements.  The rod 106
can be flexible and can be used to protect he upper most portions of the trailer 12.  The rod 106 may be used to help the cover 14 better fit onto the upper surface 34 and front surface 32 of various trailer 12 types.
 The rod 106 may be 1/4'' in diameter in some arrangements and may be made of graphite or plastic.  A second pocket 108 and rod 106 can be included on the other side of the cover 14.  Although described as being contained within a pocket 108, a
tube or other holding mechanism can be employed to cause the rod 106 to be retained onto the cover 14.  The rod 106 can be inboard or outboard of the grommets 62, 80 proximate to the rod 106 in the side direction.
 Although described as being used with a trailer 12 that is a fifth wheel trailer used for camping, the protective cover system 10 can be used with various types of trailers 12 in accordance with other exemplary embodiments.  For instance,
trailer 12 may be a transport trailer of a tractor trailer truck, a utility trailer, or any other type of trailer carried by a pulling vehicle.
 While the present invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the subject matter encompassed by way of the present invention is not to be limited to those specific embodiments.  On
the contrary, it is intended for the subject matter of the invention to include all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as can be included within the spirit and scope of the following claims.

 The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-075548 filed on Mar.  29, 2012, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 1.  Field of the Invention
 The present invention relates to a press-formed product, and in particular, to a press-formed product including a top panel portion and a side panel portion.
 2.  Description of the Related Art
 There are known press-formed products (press products), such as roof side rail reinforcements, that have a substantially hat-shaped cross-section or a substantially U-shaped cross sectional shape in the longitudinal direction and in which a side
wall portion (side panel portion) of the cross section is curved (a bent portion is curved) in the longitudinal direction.
 In some existing press-formed products, a side wall portion includes a length difference absorbing portion that is bent or curved in the thickness direction of the side wall portion so as to prevent or suppress torsion of the press-formed
products due to occurrence of a stress difference caused by a length difference or the like (see, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2009-73420).
 Springback and torsion due to springback usually occur in curved press-formed products.
 That is, in a press-formed product 300 illustrated in FIGS. 18 to 19C, whose cross section (taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction) is U-shaped and whose bent portion is curved, springback occurs as illustrated in FIGS.
20A to 20C.  As a result, large torsion occurs in the press-formed product 300.
 The term ""REFERENCE"" in FIGS. 20B and 20C refers to the target shape of the press-formed product (when manufacturing the press-formed product).  The symbol ""+"" shows that springback is oriented outward from the cross section, and the symbol ""-""
shows that springback is oriented inward of the cross section (the same applies to FIGS. 3B, 3C, 11B, 11C, 14B, 14C, 17B, and 17C).
 Occurrence of torsion can be prevented or suppressed by providing a side wall portion with a length difference absorbing portion that is bent or curved in the thickness direction of the side wall portion as in the related-art example described
above.  In this case, however, a problem arises in that the strength of the press-formed product is reduced because a bending line of the length difference absorbing portion becomes the origin of deformation of the press-formed product.
 For example, as illustrated in FIGS. b 3 and 8 of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2009-73420, the press-formed product includes bent portions (steps) 44 and 46.  If a pressing load is applied to the press-formed product in
the horizontal direction of FIG. 3 of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2009-73420 (in the vertical direction of FIG. 8 of Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2009-73420), a bending moment is generated at the steps
44 and 46, and the strength of the press-formed product is reduced.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a press-formed product whose bent portion is curved and that can suppress or prevent occurrence of springback after being press-formed and can suppress or prevent occurrence of
torsion.
 According to an aspect of the invention, a press-formed product includes a top panel portion, and a side panel portion connected to the top panel portion through a bent portion that is curved so as to have an arc shape.  The top panel portion
includes a recessed portion that is curved so as to have an arc shape in a direction opposite to a direction in which the bent portion is curved.
 In the press-formed product, the side panel portion may include a first side panel portion and a second side panel portion, the bent portion may include a first bent portion formed on one side of the top panel portion and a second bent portion
formed on the other side of the top panel portion, the first side panel portion may be connected to the top panel portion through the first bent portion, the second side panel portion may be connected to the top panel portion through the second bent
portion, and the second side panel portion may protrude toward the same side that the first side panel portion does.  The recessed portion may be formed between the first and second bent portions, and a bottom portion of the recessed portion may have a
curvilinear shape that is curved in a direction opposite to a direction in which the first and second bent portions are curved.
 In the press-formed product, the first bent portion and the second bent portion may be each curved so as to have an arc shape in plan view, and a center of an arc of the bottom portion of the recessed portion and centers of arcs of the first and
second bent portions may be located opposite each other with the top panel portion therebetween in plan view.
 In the press-formed product, the first bent portion and the second bent portion may be each curved so as to have an arc shape in side view, and a center of an arc of the bottom portion of the recessed portion and centers of arcs of the first and
second bent portions may be located opposite each other with the top panel portion therebetween in side view.
 In the press-formed product, the number of side panel portions may be one, the number of bent portions may be one, the side panel portion may be disposed on one side of the top panel portion and connected to the top panel portion through the
bent portion, and a bottom portion of the recessed portion may have a curvilinear shape that is curved in a direction opposite to a direction in which the bent portion is curved.
 According to a second aspect of the invention, a press-formed product includes a top panel portion, a first side panel portion connected to the top panel portion through a first bent portion that is curved so as to have an arc shape and that is
formed on one side of the top panel portion, a second side panel portion connected to the top panel portion through a second bent portion that is curved so as to have an arc shape and that is formed on the other side of the top panel portion.  The top
panel portion includes a recessed portion that is curved so as to have an arc shape.  The second side panel portion protrudes toward the same side that the first side panel portion does.  The recessed portion is formed between the first and second bent
portions.
 The present invention has an advantage in that a press-formed product can be provided whose bent portion is curved and that can suppress or prevent occurrence of springback after being press-formed and can suppress or prevent occurrence of
torsion. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DESCRIPTION
 Press-formed products (press products) according to embodiments of the present invention are used, for example, as vehicle body parts such as roof side rail reinforcements.
 First Embodiment
 As illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 2C, a press-formed product 1 according to a first embodiment of the present invention includes a top panel portion 3 and side panel portions 7.  The side panel portions 7 are connected to the top panel portion 3
through bent portions 5, each of which is curved so as to have an arc shape.
 The press-formed product 1 is made by, for example, press-forming a flat plate-like material (a metal material such as a high-tensile steel sheet) by using a die and the like.  Thus, the top panel portion 3 and the side panel portions 7 are
integrally formed.  The top panel portion 3 and each of the side panel portions 7 are disposed opposite each other with a corresponding one of the bent portions 5 therebetween.
 For convenience of description, a direction along the length of the press-formed product 1 may be referred to as the ""longitudinal direction"", a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction may be referred to as the ""width direction"" of
the press-formed product 1, and the direction perpendicular to the width direction and the longitudinal direction may be referred to as the ""height direction"" (vertical direction) of the press-formed product 1.
 The bent portions 5 extend, for example, in the longitudinal direction of the flat plate-like material (the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1).  However, because the bent portions 5 are curved, the directions in which the bent
portions 5 extend are not completely the same as the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1.  Due to the presence of the bent portions 5, the press-formed product 1 has a three-dimensional shape instead of a two-dimensional shape.
 The top panel portion 3 includes a recessed portion 9.  The recessed portion 9 is curved so as to have an arc shape in a direction opposite to a direction in which the bent portions 5 are curved, and extends in the longitudinal direction of the
flat plate-like material (the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1).  As with the case of the bent portions 5, because the recessed portion 9 is also curved, the direction in which the recessed portion 9 extends is not completely the same
as the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1.
 The side panel portions 7 protrude from the top panel portion 3 downward in the height direction of the press-formed product 1 by a predetermined amount.  The recessed portion 9 is a part of the top panel portion 3 that protrudes toward the same
side that the side panel portions 7 do.
 In the press-formed product 1, the radius of curvature of an arc of each of the bent portions 5 is constant.  However, the radius of curvature need not be constant and may vary in a direction in which the arc extends.  For example, the radius of
curvature of both end portions of the arc of each of the bent portions 5 may be larger than or smaller than that of a central portion of the arc in which the arc extends.
 Likewise, although the radius of curvature of an arc of the recessed portion 9 of the press-formed product 1 is constant, it is not necessary that the radius of curvature be constant.
 In the press-formed product 1, a pair of the side panel portions 7 are provided.  One of the side panel portions 7 (a first side panel portion 7A) is connected to the top panel portion 3 through one of the bent portions 5 (a first bent portion
5A), which is formed on one side of the top panel portion 3 in the width direction.
 The other of the side panel portions 7 (a second side panel portion 7B) is connected to the top panel portion 3 through the other of the bent portions 5 (a second bent portion 5B), which is formed on the other side of the top panel portion 3 in
the width direction.  The second side panel portion 7B protrudes from the top panel portion 3 toward the same side that the first side panel portion 7A does.  The second side panel portion 7B may protrude toward a side opposite to the side toward which
the first side panel portion 7A protrudes.
 The bent portions 5A and 5B are separated from each other and extend substantially parallel to each other.
 The recessed portion 9 is formed between the bent portions 5A and 5B, and a bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 has a curvilinear shape.  The bending line of the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 is curved so as to have an arc
shape in a direction opposite to the direction in which the bent portions 5A and 5B are curved (see FIG. 2A).
 A cross section of the press-formed product 1 taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1 (the direction in which the bent portions 5 extend) is generally M-shaped (see FIGS. 2B and 2C).
 In the press-formed product 1, a bending line 13A of the first bent portion 5A and a bending line 13B of the second bent portion 5B generally lie in the same plane.
 Here, the bending lines 13A and 13B of the bent portions 5A and 5B are, for example, the ridge lines of the bent portions 5 of FIGS. 2B and 2C (shown as the vertices of rounded portions; in FIG. 2A, the arc-shaped ridge lines of the bent
portions 5A and 5B).
 The bending lines 13 (13A and 13B) of the bent portions 5 (5A and 5B) generally lie in the same plane.  In some embodiments, when the press-formed product 1 is placed on a horizontal flat surface (an upper surface of a surface plate) so that the
top panel portion 3 is positioned below the side panel portions 7 (7A and 7B), the entireties of the ridge lines (two arc-shaped ridge lines) 13 (13A and 13B) of the bent portions 5 (5A and 5B) are in contact with the upper surface of the surface plate.
 As can be seen from FIG. 2A, when seen in a direction (the height direction of the press-formed product 1) perpendicular to the aforementioned plane (an upper surface of a surface plate) (in plan view), the center of the arc of the first bent
portion 5A (the bending line 13A) and the center of the arc of the second bent portion 5B (the bending line 13B) are the same as each other.  The center of the arc of the first bent portion 5A and the center of the arc of the second bent portion 5B are
located in the aforementioned plane.
 In plan view, the radius (the radius of curvature) of the arc of the first bent portion 5A is larger than the radius (the radius of curvature) of the second bent portion 5B.
 In plan view, one end of the arc of the first bent portion 5A, one end of the arc of the second bent portion 5B, and the centers of the arcs of the bent portions 5 (5A and 5B) are arranged in a straight line.  In plan view, the other end of the
arc of the first bent portion 5A, the other end of the arc of the second bent portion 5B, and the centers of the arcs of the bent portions 5 (5A and 5B) are arranged in another straight line.
 However, the description above is not a limitation, and it is only necessary that the first bent portion 5A and the second bent portion 5B be curved so as to have arc shapes in plan view.
 That is, it is only necessary that the press-formed product 1 be configured such that the first and second bent portions 5A and 5B be curved so as to have arc shapes in plan view, and the center of the arc of the bottom portion 11 of the
recessed portion 9 and the centers of the arcs of the bent portions 5A and 5B be located opposite each other with the top panel portion 3 therebetween in plan view.  The first bent portion 5A, the second bent portion 5B, and the recessed portion 9 may be
partially curved.
 In plan view, the top panel portion 3 has a substantially sectoral shape.  That is, the top panel portion 3 has a shape that is traced by a line segment drawn on a plane when the line segment is rotated by a predetermined angle (such as
30.degree.) around a point that is on an extension of the line segment and at a predetermined distance from the line segment.
 In plan view, the center of the arc of the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 and the centers of the arcs of the bent portions 5 (5A and 5B) are located opposite each other with the top panel portion 3 therebetween.  That is, the
centers of the arcs of the bent portions 5 (5A and 5B) are located above and away from the press-formed product 1 illustrated in FIG. 2A, and the center of the arc of the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 is located below and away from the
press-formed product 1 illustrated in FIG. 2A.  In the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1, the positions of the centers of the arcs of the bent portions 5 (5A and 5B) and the position of the center of the arc of the bottom portion 11 of
the recessed portion 9 are the same as the position of the center of the press-formed product 1.
 The radius of curvature of the arc of the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 is larger than the radius of curvature of the arc of the first bent portion 5A and the radius of curvature of the arc of the second bent portion 5B.  However,
the radius of curvature of the arc of the bottom portion 11 may be smaller than or equal to the radius of curvature of the arc of each of the first and second bent portions 5A and 5B.
 The press-formed product 1 will be described in more detail.  The cross sectional shape of the top panel portion 3 of the press-formed product 1 (the shape of a cross section taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the
press-formed product 1 and the top panel portion 3) is V-shaped.  However, the bottom portion 11, which is V-shaped, is not located at a fixed position in the width direction of the press-formed product 1, and the position of the bottom portion 11 varies
to some extent in the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1 (see FIGS. 2B and 2C and other figures).
 For example, at both end portions of the press-formed product 1 in the longitudinal direction (the left and right end portions of the press-formed product 1 in FIG. 2A), the V-shaped bottom (bottom portion) 11 is located at a position nearer to
the first bent portion 5A in the width direction of the press-formed product 1 (in a lower part in the vertical direction in FIG. 2A).  In a middle portion of the press-formed product 1 in the longitudinal direction, the V-shaped bottom (bottom portion)
11 is located at a position nearer to the second bent portion 5B in the width direction of the press-formed product 1 (in an upper part of FIG. 2A).
 The depth of the V-shaped bottom (bottom portion) 11 (the distance between each of the bent portions 5 and the V-shaped bottom portion 11 in the height direction of the press-formed product 1) is substantially constant.
 The side panel portions 7 (7A and 7B) stand on the top panel portion 3 in the height direction of the press-formed product 1.  Thus, in plan view of the press-formed product 1, not only the top panel portion 3 but also the entirety of the
press-formed product 1 including the side panel portions 7 has a substantially sectoral shape as described above (see FIG. 2A).
 The height dimensions of the side panel portions 7 (7A and 7B) are substantially constant along the longitudinal dimension.  Thus, although not illustrated, the press-formed product 1 has an elongated rectangular shape when seen in the width
direction.
 Here, a simulation result showing the amount of springback after the press-formed product 1 has been formed will be described.  As can be seen from FIG. 3A, the amount of springback of the press-formed product 1 is smaller than that of the
existing press-formed product 300 illustrated in FIG. 20A.
 For example, the maximum springback amount of the existing press-formed product 300 is 6.48 mm, while the maximum springback amount of the press-formed product 1 is 2.13 mm.
 In the press-formed product 1, the top panel portion 3 includes the recessed portion 9, which is curved so as to have an arc shape in a direction opposite to a direction in which the bent portions 5 are curved.  Therefore, residual stress
generated in the press-formed product 1 due to press-forming is appropriately cancelled out (the internal stress can be appropriately balanced so that the amount of springback of the press-formed product 1 is reduced).  Thus, in the press-formed product
1, occurrence of springback after being press-formed can be suppressed or prevented and occurrence of torsion can be suppressed or prevented.
 With the press-formed product 1, it is not necessary to provide the side panel portions 7 with a length difference absorbing portion that is bent or curved in the thickness direction of the side panel portion 7 (a length difference absorbing
portion described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2009-73420) or the like, and therefore the strength of the press-formed product 1 is not reduced.
 The shape of the press-formed product 1 may be appropriately modified as illustrated in FIGS. 4A to 6F.
 Modifications of the press-formed product 1 will be described in detail.  In plan view, the press-formed product 1 described above has the shape illustrated in FIG. 4A.  However, the recessed portion 9 (the bottom portion 11) may be linear as
illustrated in FIG. 4B, or the recessed portion 9 (the bottom portion 11) may be curved in the same direction as the bent portions 5 are curved as illustrated in FIG. 4C.  In these cases, the radius of curvature of the recessed portion 9 (the bottom
portion 11) is larger than that of each of the bent portions 5.
 As illustrated in FIG. 5A, attachment portions (attachment portions used to attach the press-formed product 1 to another structure or the like) 15 may be formed in the recessed portion 9 (the bottom portion 11).  In addition to or instead of the
attachment portions 15, through-holes or the like may be formed in the recessed portion 9.  By forming the attachment portions 15 or the like, the recessed portion 9 (the bottom portion 11) is divided at the positions at which the attachment portions 15
or the like are formed.  The attachment portions 15 or the like may be disposed either at positions in the recessed portion 9 (the bottom portion 11) or at positions outside of the recessed portion 9 (at appropriate positions in the top panel portion 3
or the side panel portions 7).
 As illustrated in FIG. 5B, the recessed portion 9 (the bottom portion 11) may be formed in only a part of the top panel portion 3 (for example, in only a middle portion in the longitudinal direction).
 The press-formed product 1 may include a pair of flange portions 17, each having a plate-like shape (for example, a flat plate-like shape) and integrated with the press-formed product 1, and the cross sectional shape of the press-formed product
1 (the shape of a cross section taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1) may be as illustrated in FIG. 5C.  Each of the flange portions 17 protrudes from an end of a corresponding one of the side
panel portions 7 in the width direction of the press-formed product 1.  The thickness direction of the flange portions 17 is the same as the height direction of the press-formed product 1.  One of the flange portions 17 may be omitted.
 The cross sectional shape of the press-formed product 1 (the shape of a cross section of the press-formed product 1 taken along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1) may be appropriately modified as
illustrated in FIGS. 6A to 6F.
 FIG. 6A is a cross sectional view of the press-formed product 1 illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 2C.  In the press-formed product 1 of FIG. 6A, the top panel portion 3 includes flat portions 19.  The flat portions 19 are formed in the top panel portion
3 at positions adjacent to the side panel portions 7, and the recessed portion 9 is not formed in the flat portions 19.  The thickness direction of the flat portions 19 is the same as the height direction of the press-formed product 1.
 FIG. 6B illustrates a modification of the press-formed product 1, which is different from that of FIG. 6A in that the flat portions 19 are omitted.  Therefore, substantially the entirety of the recessed portion 9 is substantially the entirety of
the top panel portion 3.
 Note that the press-formed product 1 illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 2C includes the flat portions 19.  However, the press-formed product 1 illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 2C looks like the modification illustrated in FIG. 6B, because the flat portions 19
are very small.
 FIG. 6C illustrates a modification of the press-formed product 1, which differs from that of FIG. 6A in that the recessed portion 9 is arc-shaped (for example, semicircular).  FIG. 6D illustrates a modification of the press-formed product 1,
which differs from that of FIG. 6A in that the recessed portion 9 is U-shaped.  FIG. 6E illustrates a modification of the press-formed product 1, which differs from that of FIG. 6A in that the recessed portion 9 is trapezoidal (for example, isosceles
trapezoidal).  FIG. 6F illustrates a modification of the press-formed product 1, which differs from that of FIG. 6A in that the side panel portions 7 protrude diagonally from the top panel portion 3.  The distance between the side panel portions 7 (7A
and 7B) increases with increasing distance from the top panel portion 3.
 Second Embodiment
 FIGS. 7 to 8C illustrate a press-formed product 1a according to a second embodiment, which differs from the press-formed product 1 according to the first embodiment in that the first side panel portion 7A and the first bent portion 5A are
omitted.  In other respects, the press-formed product 1a has the same structure and substantially the same advantage as the press-formed product 1 according to the first embodiment does.  Where possible, the press-formed product 1a according to the
second embodiment may be modified in the same way as in the case of the press-formed product 1 according to the first embodiment.
 To be specific, the press-formed product 1a according to the second embodiment includes only one side panel portion 7 (7B) disposed on one side of the top panel portion 3, and the side panel portion 7 is connected to the top panel portion 3
through one bent portion 5.
 Thus, a cross section of the press-formed product 1a taken along a plane perpendicular to the direction in which the bent portion 5 extends (the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1a) has a shape (substantially L-shape) formed by
removing the first side panel portion 7A and the first bent portion 5A from the generally M-shaped press-formed product 1.
 The bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 has a curvilinear shape, and the bending line of the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 is curved in a direction opposite to a direction in which the bent portion 5 is curved.
 The press-formed product 1a will be described further.  As in the case of FIGS. 2B and 2C, the bending line 13 of the bent portion 5 is the ridge line of the bent portion 5.
 When the press-formed product 1a is seen in the width direction, although not illustrated, the side panel portion 7 has an elongated rectangular shape, and the bent portion 5 has a linear shape.  The bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9
also has a linear shape and extends parallel to the bent portion 5.
 As illustrated in FIG. 8A, when seen in the height direction of the press-formed product 1a (in plan view), the top panel portion 3 has a substantially sectoral shape.  The side panel portion 7 protrudes from the bent portion 5, which is formed
on one side of the top panel portion 3 in the width direction, toward one side of the press-formed product 1a in the height direction (for example, downward, toward the back side of the plane of FIG. 8A).
 In plan view, one end portion of the top panel portion 3 in the width direction (the bent portion 5; the side panel portion 7) has an arc shape, and the other end portion of the top panel portion 3 in the width direction also has an arc shape
(whose radius of curvature is larger than that of the one end portion).  The centers of the arcs of both end portions of the top panel portion 3 are the same as each other.
 As can be seen from FIG. 8A, in plan view, the centers of the arcs of both end portions of the top panel portion 3 in the width direction are located above and away from the top panel portion 3.
 In plan view, the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 has an arc shape (whose radius of curvature is larger than those of both end portions of the top panel portion 3 in the width direction), and the center of the arc of the bottom
portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 and the centers of the arcs of both end portions of the top panel portion 3 are located opposite each other with the top panel portion 3 therebetween (in FIG. 8A, the center of the arc of the bottom portion 11 is
located below the press-formed product 1a).
 The depth of the recessed portion 9 (the distance between the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 and the bent portion 5 in the height direction) is constant.
 The distance between the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 and the side panel portion 7 (the dimension of the press-formed product 1a in the width direction) is the largest at both ends of the press-formed product 1a in the
longitudinal direction, gradually decreases toward the center of the press-formed product 1a in the longitudinal direction, and is the smallest at the center of the press-formed product 1a in the longitudinal direction (see FIG. 8A).
 In the press-formed product 1a, the side panel portion 7 (the bent portion 5) may be disposed on the opposite side.  That is, the press-formed product 1a according to the second embodiment may differ from the press-formed product 1 according to
the first embodiment in that the second side panel portion 7B and the second bent portion 5B are omitted.
 Third Embodiment
 FIGS. 9 to 10C illustrate a press-formed product 1b according to a third embodiment, which differs from the press-formed product 1 according to the first embodiment in the manner in which the bent portions 5 and the like are curved.  In other
respects, the press-formed product 1b has the same structure and substantially the same advantage as the press-formed product 1 according to the first embodiment does.  The press-formed product, 1b according to the third embodiment may be modified in the
same way as in the case of the press-formed product 1 according to the first embodiment.
 In the press-formed product 1b according to the third embodiment, the bending line 13A of the first bent portion 5A lies in a plane that is parallel to the plane of FIG. 10A and that is located slightly away from the back side of the plane of
FIG. 10A.
 The bending line 13B of the second bent portion 5B is located at a position that is separated by a predetermined distance from the bending line 13A of the first bent portion 5A in a direction perpendicular to the aforementioned plane (in a
direction perpendicular to the plane of the FIG. 10A) (in a plane that is parallel to the plane of FIG. 10A and located farther away from the back side of the plane of FIG. 10A).
 To be more specific, the bending lines 13A and 13B of the bent portions 5A and 5B extend parallel to each other with a predetermined distance therebetween in the width direction of the press-formed product 1b.  Moreover, as illustrated in FIG.
10A, when seen in the width direction of the press-formed product 1b, the bent portions 5A and 5B (the bending lines 13A and 13B) overlap each other.
 However, the description above is not a limitation, and it is only necessary that each of the first and second bent portions 5A and 5B be curved so as to have an arc shape when seen in the width direction of the press-formed product 1b (in side
view).
 That is, it is only necessary that the press-formed product 1b be configured such that each of the first and second bent portions 5A and 5B is curved so as to have an arc shape in side view, and the center of the arc of the bottom portion 11 of
the recessed portion 9 and the centers of the arcs of the bent portions 5A and 5B are located opposite each other with the top panel portion 3 therebetween in side view.  The first bent portion 5A, the second bent portion 5B, and the recessed portion 9
may be partially curved.
 As in the case of FIGS. 2B and 2C, the bending lines 13 of the bent portions 5 are the ridge lines of the bent portions 5.
 As illustrated in FIG. 10A, when seen in a direction perpendicular to the aforementioned plane (in the width direction the press-formed product 1b) (in side view), the center of the arc of the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 and the
centers of the arcs of the bent portions 5 are located opposite each other with the top panel portion 3 (the press-formed product 1b) therebetween.
 When the press-formed product 1b is seen in the height direction (in plan view), although not illustrated, the top panel portion 3 has an elongated rectangular shape, and the bent portions 5A and 5B (the bending lines 13A and 13B) are each
linear and extend parallel to each other.  The bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 is also linear, and extends parallel to the bent portions 5A and 5B so as to pass through a point (for example, the midpoint) between the bent portions 5A and 5B.
 When the press-formed product 1b is seen in the width direction, as illustrated in FIG. 10A, the side panel portion 7 protrudes from the top panel portion 3 toward a side on which the centers of the arcs of the bent portions 5A and 5B (the
bending lines 13A and 13B) are located (downward in FIG. 10A).
 Each of the side panel portions 7A and 7B extends in the height direction and the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1b.  That is, the thickness direction of each of the side panel portions 7A and 7B is the same as the width
direction of the press-formed product 1b.  Thus, when the press-formed product 1b is seen in the height direction, the press-formed product 1b also has an elongated rectangular shape.  When the press-formed product 1b is seen in the width direction, as
illustrated in FIG. 10A, the press-formed product 1b has a substantially sectoral shape, and the side panel portions 7A and 7B overlap each other.
 When the press-formed product 1b is seen in the width direction, the center of the arc of the upper end portion of each side panel portion 7 (the bending line 13 of each bent portion 5) and the center of the arc of the lower end portion of the
side panel portion 7 are located below the top panel portion 3 and are the same as each other, and the radius of curvature of the arc of the upper end portion of each side panel portion 7 is larger than the radius of curvature of the arc of the lower end
portion of the side panel portion 7.  The center of the arc of the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 is located above the top panel portion 3 (see FIG. 10A).
 As illustrated in FIG. 10A, the depth of the recessed portion 9 (the distance between the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 and each of the bent portions 5 in the height direction) is the smallest at both ends of the press-formed
product 1b in the longitudinal direction and gradually increases toward the center of the press-formed product 1b in the longitudinal direction.  At the center of the press-formed product 1b in the longitudinal direction, for example, the depth of the
recessed portion 9 is substantially the same as the height dimension of the side panel portions 7 (see FIG. 10B).
 Here, a simulation result showing the amount of springback after the press-formed product 1b has been formed will be described.  As can be seen from FIG. 11A, the amount of springback of the press-formed product 1b is smaller than that of the
existing press-formed product 300 illustrated in FIG. 20A.
 For example, the maximum springback amount of the existing press-formed product 300 is 6.48 mm, while the maximum springback amount of the press-formed product 1b is 3.96 mm.
 Fourth Embodiment
 FIGS. 12 to 13C illustrate a press-formed product 1c according to a fourth embodiment, which differs from the press-formed product 1b according to the third embodiment in the manner in which the bent portions 5 and the like are curved.  In other
respects, the press-formed product 1c according to the fourth embodiment has the same structure and substantially the same advantage as the press-formed product 1b according to the third embodiment does.  The press-formed product 1c according to the
fourth embodiment may be modified in the same way as in the case of the press-formed product 1 according to the first embodiment.
 The bent portions 5 and the recessed portion 9 of the press-formed product 1c according to the fourth embodiment are curved in a direction opposite to the direction in which the bent portions 5 and the recessed portion 9 of the press-formed
product 1b according to the third embodiment are curved.
 When the press-formed product 1c is seen in the height direction, although not illustrated, as with the press-formed product 1b of FIGS. 9 to 10C, the top panel portion 3 has an elongated rectangular shape, and the bent portions 5 are linear and
extend parallel to each other.  The bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 is also linear and extends parallel to the bent portions 5 so as to pass through a point (for example, the midpoint) between the bent portions 5.
 When the press-formed product 1c is seen in the width direction, the side panel portions 7 protrude from the top panel portion 3 toward a side opposite to the side on which the centers of the arcs of the bent portions 5 are located (downward in
FIG. 13A).
 Each of the side panel portions 7 extends in the height direction and the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1c.  That is, the thickness direction of the side panel portion 7 is the same as the width direction of the press-formed
product 1c.  Thus, when the press-formed product is seen in the height direction, the press-formed product 1c also has an elongated rectangular shape.  As illustrated in FIG. 13A, when the press-formed product 1c is seen in the width direction, the side
panel portions 7A and 7B overlap each other.
 When the press-formed product 1c is seen in the width direction, as illustrated in FIG. 13A, each of the side panel portions 7A and 7B has a substantially sectoral shape.  The center of the arc of the upper end portion of each side panel portion
7 (the bending line 13 of each bent portion 5) and the center of the arc of the lower end portion of the side panel portion 7 are located above the top panel portion 3 and are the same as each other.  The radius of curvature of the arc of the upper end
portion of each side panel portion 7 is smaller than the radius of curvature of the arc of the lower end portion of the side panel portion 7.  The center of the arc of the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 is located below the top panel portion
3.
 As illustrated in FIG. 13A, the depth of the recessed portion 9 (the distance between the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 and each of the bent portions 5 in the height direction) is the largest at both ends of the press-formed
product 1c in the longitudinal direction and gradually decreases toward the center of the press-formed product 1c in the longitudinal direction.  For example, at both end portions of the press-formed product 1c in the longitudinal direction, the depth of
the recessed portion 9 is the largest and is slightly smaller than the height dimension of the side panel portions 7 (see FIG. 13C).
 Here, a simulation result showing the amount of springback after the press-formed product 1c has been formed will be described.  As can be seen from FIG. 14A, the amount of springback of the press-formed product 1c is smaller than that of the
existing press-formed product 300 illustrated in FIG. 20A.
 For example, the maximum springback amount of the existing press-formed product 300 is 6.48 mm, while the maximum springback amount of the press-formed product 1c is 2.59 mm.
 Fifth Embodiment
 FIGS. 15 to 16C illustrate a press-formed product 1d according to a fifth embodiment, which differs from the press-formed product 1 according to the first embodiment in the manner in which the recessed portion 9 and the like are curved.  In
other respects, the press-formed product 1d according to the fifth embodiment has the same structure and substantially the same advantage as the press-formed product 1 according to the first embodiment does.  The press-formed product 1d according to the
fifth embodiment may be modified in the same way as in the case of the press-formed product 1 according to the first embodiment.
 In the press-formed product 1d according to the fifth embodiment, the recessed portion 9, which is formed in the top panel portion 3, is curved so as to have an arc shape in such a way that the recessed portion 9 extends parallel to the bent
portions 5.
 That is, the recessed portion 9 is formed between the bent portions 5A and 5B, the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 has an arc shape, and the bending line of the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 is curved in the same
direction as the bent portions 5A and 5B (the bending lines 13A and 13B) are curved.
 The depth of the recessed portion 9 (the distance between the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion 9 and each of the bent portions 5 in the height direction) is constant, and the bending line of the bottom portion 11 of the recessed portion
9 extends through the central part, in the width direction, of the press-formed product 1d.
 Thus, the cross section of the press-formed product 1d taken along a plane perpendicular to a direction in which the bent portions 5 extend (the longitudinal direction of the press-formed product 1d) is substantially uniformly M-shaped (see
FIGS. 16B and 16C).
 Here, a simulation result showing the amount of springback of the press-formed product 1d after the press-formed product ld has been formed will be described.  As can be seen from FIG. 17A, the amount of springback of the press-formed product 1d
is smaller than that of the existing press-formed product 300 illustrated in FIG. 20A.
 For example, the maximum springback amount of the existing press-formed product 300 is 6.48 mm, while the maximum springback amount of the press-formed product 1d is 2.88 mm.
 The values of the amount of springback of each the press-formed products 1, 1b, 1c, and 1d are more symmetric than those of the existing press-formed product 300.  Therefore, the press-formed product 1c can be more easily used than the existing
press-formed product 300.
 As with the press-formed product 1a, one of the side wall portions may be omitted from each of the press-formed products 1b, 1c, and 1d.
 As can be understood from the description using FIGS. 4A to 4C and other figures, the press-formed product described above is an example of a press-formed product having a recessed portion that is formed in a top panel portion and that is curved
so as to have an arc shape.
 In the press-formed product, the recessed portion may extend nonparallel to the bent portion.  For example, the bending line formed at the bottom of the recessed portion may be nonparallel to the bending line of bent portion.
 For example, the bending line of the bent portion may be curved so as to have an arc shape and the bending line at the bottom of the recessed portion may be linear (see FIG. 4B).  Alternatively, the bending line of the bent portion and the
bending line at the bottom of the recessed portion may be curved so as to have arc shapes extending, not in opposite directions, but in the same direction; and the radius of curvature of the bending line of the bent portion may be larger than the radius
of curvature of the bending line of the recessed portion (see FIG. 4C).
 The foregoing is provided for purposes of illustrating, explaining, and describing embodiments of the present invention.  Further modifications and adaptations to these embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art and may be made
without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.  Different arrangements of the components depicted in the drawings or described above, as well as components and steps not shown or described are possible.  Similarly, some features and
subcombinations are useful and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations.  Embodiments of the invention have been described for illustrative and not restrictive purposes, and alternative embodiments will become apparent to
readers of this patent.  Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above or depicted in the drawings, and various embodiments and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the claims below.

 1.  Field of the Invention
 This invention relates to motor vehicles and in particular to a motor vehicle having a roof structure that can be stowed away to form an open top vehicle.
 2.  Related Art
 It is known, for example, from French Patent Publication FR-2856014 and German Patent Publication DE-19948746 to provide a motor vehicle having a roof structure which can be stowed away to convert the motor vehicle into an open top vehicle.
 It is a disadvantage of such prior art mechanisms that the roof is stowed in a luggage area of the motor vehicle, thereby reducing the space available for the transport of luggage when the roof is stowed.  It is a further problem with this type
of mechanism that it can only be used for motor vehicles having a separate luggage compartment and luggage compartment cover and is not suitable for use with a hatchback type of vehicle.
 It would be desirable to provide a motor vehicle in which the roof can be stowed without significantly reducing the volume of luggage that can be carried and which is applicable to a hatchback vehicle.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a motor vehicle having front and rear roof members moveable between raised and stowed positions, and a moveable flap located on each side of the motor vehicle to selectively bridge
a longitudinally extending gap between the front roof member and an upper edge of a rear outer panel when the front roof member is in its stowed position, wherein each flap is moveable from a stowed position in which it is positioned substantially
vertically in a storage compartment when the front roof member is in its raised position, to a deployed position in which the flap is positioned substantially horizontally so as to bridge the gap when the front roof member is in the stowed position.
 Each flap may be positioned in the stowed position when the rear roof is in a raised position.
 When the front and rear roof members are in respective raised positions, the front and rear roof members may form in combination a cover for a combined passenger and luggage compartment of the motor vehicle.
 The motor vehicle may have front and rear rows of seats and a front wall of the luggage compartment may be formed by the rear row of seats.
 The rear roof member may be stowed in front of the rear row of seats.
 Each flap may be pivotally connected to a support member to allow the flap to rotate from the stowed position to the deployed position.
 Each support member may be slidingly connected to part of a body structure of the motor vehicle so as to permit the support member to move between a raised position when the flap is in its deployed position and lowered position when the flap is
in its stowed position.
 The support member may be moveable between the lowered and raised positions by a cable connected to part of a mechanism used to stow the front roof member.
 The storage compartment for each flap may be defined by a cavity between the rear outer panel and a rear inner panel.
 The storage compartment for each flap may be formed by a cavity between the outer rear panel and a cover panel pivotally connected to an outer surface of the rear outer panel.
 The rear outer panel may have a recess formed therein which in combination with the cover panel forms the storage compartment.
 Each flap may be pivotally connected to part of a body structure of the motor vehicle by two spaced apart U-shaped arms, each of which is pivotally connected at one end to the body structure of the motor vehicle and is fastened at an opposite
end to the flap.
 At least one of the two arms may contact the cover panel to move the cover panel away from the outer rear panel during movement of the flap from the stowed position to the deployed position.
 At least one of the U-shaped arms may have a roller rotationally connected thereto for rolling contact with a corresponding rib formed on an inner surface of the cover panel to move the cover panel away from the outer rear panel during movement
of the flap from the stowed position to the raised position.
 Both of the arms may have a roller rotationally connected thereto for rolling contact with a respective rib on the cover panel.
 Each flap may be moveable between its stowed and deployed positions by a cable connected at one end to one of the two U-shaped arms and at an opposite end to part of a mechanism used to stow the front roof member.
 According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for stowing a roof of a motor vehicle having a moveable front roof member, a moveable rear roof member and a moveable flap located on each side of the motor vehicle to
selectively bridge a longitudinally extending gap between the front roof member and an upper edge of a rear outer panel when the front roof member is in a stowed position, the method comprising moving each flap from a stowed position in which it is
positioned substantially vertically in a storage compartment when the front and rear roof members are in their respective raised positions towards a deployed position in which the flap is positioned substantially horizontally so as to bridge the gap when
the front and rear roof members are moved from their respective raised position to their respective stowed positions.
 Each flap may be slid upwards from the stowed position and then rotated to reach the deployed position.
 Each flap may be moved upwards along an arc from the stowed position to the raised position. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
 Referring to the Figures, wherein like numerals indicate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views,
 With reference to FIGS. 1 to 11 there is shown a first embodiment of a motor vehicle 5 according to the invention.  The motor vehicle 5 has a body structure 3 including a pair of rear outer panels 9, one on each side of the motor vehicle 5, a
drop down lower tailgate 2, a rear roof member or panel 4 and a front roof member or panel 6.  The front and rear roof members 6 and 4 are moveable from raised positions, as shown in FIG. 1, where they form in combination a cover for a combined passenger
and luggage compartment 1 to stowed positions, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, where a two seat convertible vehicle is formed.  FIG. 2 shows an intermediate position in which the front and rear roof members 6 and 4 are partially stowed.
 To stow the two roof members 4 and 6, one of the two roof members 4 and 6 is firstly moved to disengage a rear edge of the front roof member 6 from a front edge of the rear roof member 4.  This can be achieved by sliding the rear roof member 4
rearwardly, by providing an inclined shut face, such that the forwardly and downwardly rotating rear roof member 4 disengages from any seals through its normal motion or by lifting the front roof member 6.  The rear roof member 4 is then rotated
forwardly, moved forwardly and then lowered down such that it lies below a waistline of the motor vehicle 5 this can be achieved as distinct operations or simultaneous motion.
 The motor vehicle 5 has two rows of seats located in the combined passenger and luggage compartment 1.  There is a front row of seats including a seat for a driver of the motor vehicle 5 towards the front of the combined passenger and luggage
compartment 1, and a rear row of seats which forms a front wall of the luggage compartment towards the rear of the combined passenger and luggage compartment 1.  Such a vehicle is often referred to as a two box vehicle because there is no dividing wall
between the luggage compartment and the passenger compartment, only a dividing wall between the passenger compartment and an engine compartment.
 When the rear roof member 4 is in its stowed position, it lies between the front and rear row of seats and does not reduce the volume of the luggage area.
 The front roof member 6 is moved at the same time as the rear roof member 4 from its raised position to its stowed position but the motions are phased such that the rear roof member 4 reaches its stowed position before the front roof member 6
reaches its stowed position.
 When the front roof member 6 is in its stowed position it lies substantially horizontally across the rear of the motor vehicle 5 to form a cover for the luggage compartment of the motor vehicle 5.  Access to the luggage compartment is still
possible by opening the tailgate 2, and because the rear roof member 4 is stowed in front of the rear row of seats there is substantially no loss of luggage compartment volume.
 However, when the front roof member 6 is in its stowed position, a longitudinally extending gap is present along each longitudinal edge of the front roof member 6 because the width of the front roof member 6 is less than the width of the motor
vehicle body at its waistline.
 In order to cover the longitudinally extending gaps, the motor vehicle 5 has two flaps 7, one on each side of the motor vehicle 5, which are deployed to cover the gaps when the front roof 6 is stowed.  The flaps 7 are stowed in respective
storage compartments when the front roof member 6 is in its raised position.
 With particular reference to FIGS. 6 to 11, one of the flaps 7 and an associated actuation mechanism is shown in greater detail.
 The flap 7 is pivotally connected by means of a piano hinge 17 to a support member in the form of a carrier plate 18, which is attached at a lower end to a cable 11 used to actuate the flap 7.
 The carrier plate 18 has a guide rail 24 attached thereto near to one side for sliding engagement with a U-shaped support 25 fastened to part of the body structure 3.  On an opposite side of the carrier plate 18 an outwardly extending finger 22
is formed as part of the carrier plate 18 for sliding engagement with a groove 21 formed in a second U-shaped support 20.  An upper end of the second U-shaped support is formed into a curved guide 23 for the flap 7.
 As is shown in FIG. 6, the cable 11 is connected at an opposite end to a pulley 15 fastened to an arm 14 used to move the front roof member 6 between its respective raised and stowed positions.  A second arm 13 is also connected to the front
roof member 6 to control the motion of the front roof member 6 so as to ensure that it is substantially horizontally arranged when it is in its raised and stowed positions.
 A spring 12 is positioned between the carrier plate 18 and the body structure 3 to bias the flap 7 into its stowed position, and the cable 11 is used to pull the carrier plate 18 upwardly so as to move the flap 7 into its deployed position. 
That is to say, when the arm 14 moves in the direction of arrow ""S"" on FIG. 6 to move the front roof member 6 towards the stowed position, the cable 11 is wrapped around the pulley 15 thereby pulling the carrier plate 18 upwards against the action of the
spring 12.  A further spring (not shown) can be attached between the flap 7 and the carrier plate 18 to ensure that the flap 7 is moved into a horizontal position when it is deployed.  When the front roof member 6 moves from its stowed position towards
its raised position, the cable 11 is unwrapped from the pulley 15, thereby allowing the flap 7 to move to its stowed position due to the action of the spring 12.
 As can be seen on FIG. 6, the flap 7 is stowed in a substantially vertical position in a storage compartment formed by a cavity defined between the rear outer panel 9 and a rear inner panel 8.  This cavity is also used to stow a drop down side
window 10 when the side window 10 is lowered.
 FIGS. 7, 8 and 10 show an alternative arrangement in which the cable 11 is connected directly to a lower edge of the carrier plate 18.  In this case the carrier plate 18 is biased by one or more springs (not shown) so as to move the flap 7 to
the deployed position, and is pulled back into the stowage compartment when the front roof member 6 moves towards the raised position.  The cable 11 in this case is wrapped further around the pulley 15 when the front roof member 6 moves towards its
raised position, and is unwrapped from the pulley 15 when the front roof member 6 moves towards its stowed position.  As before, a spring (not shown) may be attached between the flap 7 and the carrier plate 18 to bias the flap 7 towards its deployed
orientation of substantially 90 degrees to the carrier plate 18.
 Although in both of the examples described above the flap 7 is moved between its deployed and stowed positions by a cable 11 connected to the front roof stowage mechanism this need not be the case and the flap 7 could be moved independently by
any other suitable means.
 Each of the flaps 7 is arranged to be in its respective stowed position whenever the front or rear roof members 6 and 4 are in their respective raised positions and is only moved to the deployed position when the front and rear roof members 6
and 4 are stowed.
 It will be appreciated that the sequencing of the movement of the flaps 7 need not be simultaneous with the movement of the front roof member 6 and that the flaps 7 could also be arranged to be deployed so that they are already deployed when the
front roof member 6 reaches its stowed position, or be deployed after the front roof member 6 has reached its stowed position if independent actuation of the flaps 7 is used.
 FIG. 7 shows the flap 7 in its stowed position in which the flap 7 is substantially vertically arranged.
 FIGS. 8 and 9 show the flap 7 in a partially deployed position with the flap 7 resting upon the curved guide 23.  The curved guide 23 is used to control the rotation of the flap 7 as it transits between its stowed and deployed positions.
 FIGS. 10 and 11 show the flap 7 in its deployed position in which it is resting against the curved guide 23.  The flap 7 is in this position substantially horizontally disposed and is arranged at approximately 90 degrees to the carrier plate 18.
 With reference to FIGS. 12 to 17, there is shown a second embodiment of the invention which differs from that previously described in that the flap 107 is not stowed between inner and outer panels of the motor vehicle 5 but in a separate stowage
compartment located outside the rear panel, and the flap 107 is not actuated by a sliding mechanism as previously described but by a rotating arm arrangement that moves the flap 107 though an arc.
 With reference to FIG. 14 (which is diagrammatic and does not show in detail the actuation mechanism), the flap 107 is shown in its stowed position within a stowage compartment formed by a recess in the rear outer panel 9 and a moveable cover
panel 150 pivotally connected at its lower end to an outer surface of the rear outer panel 9.  The cavity defined between the outer rear panel 9 and the inner rear panel 8 is not in this case occupied by the flap 107 or its actuating mechanism, and so
there is more room for the drop down window 10 to be stowed in the cavity and, if required, more room for reinforcement of the body structure to be added in the cavity.
 As before, a cable 11 is connected at one end to the flap actuation mechanism and at an opposite end to the pulley 15 fastened to the arm 14 used to move the front roof member 6 between its respective raised and stowed positions.
 As before, a spring 12 is used to bias the flap 107 into its stowed position, and the cable 11 is used to pull the flap 7 into its deployed position.  That is to say, when the arm 14 moves in the direction of arrow ""S"" shown on FIG. 14 to move
the front roof member 6 towards the stowed position, the cable 11 is wrapped around the pulley 15 thereby pulling the flap 107 upwards against the action of the spring 12.
 The flap is connected to a first arm pivotable about the point ""V"" (corresponding to a pivot axis), and the cable 11 is attached to a second arm connected to the first arm so that the flap 107 is not slid up into position but is rotated into the
deployed position along an arc defined by the geometry of the flap actuating mechanism.
 Referring now to FIGS. 15 to 17, which show the actuating mechanism for the flap 107 in greater detail, the flap 107 is connected along one of its two longitudinal edges to a cross bar 39 used to connect two spaced apart arms 35, 36 to the flap
107.
 Each of the arms 35, 36 is U-shaped and is pivotally connected at one end to a respective bracket 51, 52 used to fasten the actuating mechanism to part of the body structure of the motor vehicle 5.  The two arms 35, 36 are therefore able to
pivot about a substantially horizontal pivot axis (corresponding to the point ""V"" on FIG. 14) extending between the two brackets 51, 52.  At an opposite end to where it is pivotally connected to one of the brackets 51, 52, each arm 35, 36 is fastened to
the cross bar 39.
 One of the arms 36 has a curved extension 40 formed with a groove (not shown) in which the cable 11 is located.  The cable 11 extends from the groove through an aperture (not shown) in the arm 36 and has a retainer cap 11A fitted to its free
end, which is used to transfer force from the cable 11 into the arm 36 when the cable 11 is pulled.
 Each of the arms 35, 36 has a respective roller 37, 38 attached thereto for engagement with a respective rib 33, 34 formed on an inner surface of the cover panel 150.  Each of the ribs 33, 34 forms a track along which the corresponding roller
37, 38 can roll.
 The cover panel 150 has an aperture 60 formed in an upper surface to conform with one edge of the flap 107 and, when the flap 107 is in its deployed position, the flap 107 is located within the aperture 60.  When the rear roof member 4 is in its
raised position, at least a portion of the rear roof member 4 overlies the aperture 60 and the upper surface of the cover panel 150 so that the cover panel 150 is held in a closed position while the rear roof member 4 is in its raised position.  The
cover panel 150 is pivotally connected at a lower end by two arms 31, 32 each of which is hingedly connected to an outer surface of the outer rear panel 9.
 As shown in FIG. 15, when the flap 107 is in its stowed position, the rollers 37, 38 are not in contact with the ribs 33, 34, and the cover panel 150 is in a closed position.
 When the flap 107 is moved towards its deployed position, the rollers 37, 38 come into contact with the ribs 33, 34 and open the cover panel 150 to allow the flap 107 to move up into its deployed position.  At the position shown in FIG. 16, the
cover panel 150 is fully open because the rollers 37, 38 are positioned at the maximum horizontal distance to the outside of the horizontal pivot axis of the two arms 35, 36 between the pivot axis and the cover panel 150.
 When the flap 107 reaches its deployed position as shown in FIG. 17, the rollers 37, 38 have gone over-centre and the horizontal distance between the rollers 37, 38 and the pivot axis of the arms 35, 36 is less than the maximum horizontal
distance, thereby allowing the cover panel 150 to move to its closed position.
 Depending upon the design of the arms 35, 36, the rollers 37, 38 are now, as shown, lightly resting against the ribs 33, 34 or are spaced apart from the ribs 33, 34 so that no contact occurs between the ribs 33, 34 and the rollers 37, 38.  One
or more springs (not shown) is provided to bias the cover panel 150 towards its closed position, the cover panel 150 being opened when it is acted against by the rollers 37, 38.
 It will be appreciated that when the flap 107 is moved from the deployed position to the stowed position, the cover panel 150 is opened to permit stowing of the flap 107 and then closed again before the rear roof member 4 reaches its raised
position.
 Although the flap 107 is described above as being moved between its deployed and stowed positions by a cable connected to the front roof stowage mechanism, this need not be the case, and the flap 107 could be moved independently by any other
suitable means.
 As before, each of the flaps 107 is arranged to be in its respective stowed position whenever the front or rear roof members 6 and 4 are in their respective raised positions, and are only moved to the deployed position when the front and rear
roof members 6 and 4 are stowed.
 It will be appreciated that the sequencing of the movement of the flaps 107 need not be simultaneous with the movement of the front roof member 6, and that the flaps 107 could also be arranged to be deployed so that they are already deployed
when the front roof member 6 reaches its stowed position, or be deployed after the front roof member 6 has reached its stowed position if independent actuation of the flaps is provided.
 Therefore in summary, a motor vehicle according to this invention is transformable from a hatch back type motor vehicle into a two seat type convertible vehicle with no substantial reduction in luggage capacity by stowing a front roof member
such that it forms a cover for the luggage compartment, and by providing a flap on each side of the motor vehicle that bridge gaps between the stowed front roof and rear outer panels of the motor vehicle.  Each flap is moved from a stowed position, in
which it is positioned substantially vertically in a storage compartment when the front and rear roof members are in their respective raised positions, towards a deployed position, in which the flap is positioned substantially horizontally so as to
bridge the gap, when the front and rear roof members are moved from their respective raised position to their respective stowed positions.
 It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that although the invention has been described by way of example with reference to one or more embodiments, it is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, and that modifications to the
disclosed embodiments or alternative embodiments could be constructed without departing from the scope of the invention.
 The foregoing invention has been described in accordance with the relevant legal standards, thus the description is exemplary rather than limiting in nature.  Variations and modifications to the disclosed embodiment may become apparent to those
skilled in the art and fall within the scope of the invention.  Accordingly the scope of legal protection afforded this invention can only be determined by studying the following claims.

 1.  Field of the Invention
 The present invention relates generally to vehicle armor for protection from explosive devices.  Further, the present invention relates to an armor system that protects vehicle occupants from land mines and improvised explosive devices.
 2.  Description of the Prior Art
 Typically, vehicle armor is used on military motor vehicles, such as a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV or Humvee).  The U.S.  Department of Defense defines three levels of protection for Humvees.  Level-one protection describes
a Humvee that comes directly from its manufacturing facility ""up-armored"" with bullet-proof glass and armor on the sides, front, rear, top, and bottom.  Level-two protection is achieved by ""add-on"" armor kits that are fitted to existing Humvees that were
originally unarmored or ""soft-skinned."" However, these kits only provide front, rear, side, and glass protection, while leaving the top and the bottom of the vehicle vulnerable.  Level-three armor refers to the use of steel plates that are welded or
bolted onto an unarmored Humvee and provides the least amount of protection to its occupants.  Even when equipped with level-one protection, however, most up-armored Humvees offer little protection against blasts from below and only sufficiently protect
against lateral attacks.
 Originally designed for personnel and light cargo transport, the basic Humvee has no armor or protection.  To provide a defense against ballistic weapons and more specifically, land mines and improvised explosive devices, prior art devices
commonly use various armor designs (see, e.g., U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,658,984; U.S.  Published Patent Application No. 2003/0010189; U.S.  Published Patent Application No. 2006/0201319; U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,663,520; U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,326,445; U.S.  Pat.  No.
7,114,764; U.S.  Published Patent Application No. 2006/0048641) and reactive elements (see, e.g., U.S.  Published Patent Application No. 2007/0017361; U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,345,563; U.S.  Published Patent Application No. 2006/0086243) to achieve the
aforementioned levels of protection.
 For example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,658,984 and U.S.  Published Patent Application No. 2003/0010189 describe an apparatus for providing anti-mine protection for an armored vehicle comprising a concave floor plate mounted to the outer hull of a
vehicle.  Similarly, U.S.  Patent Application No. 2006/0201319 describes a ""convex-shaped"" protection apparatus attached underneath a vehicle that is capable of resisting a force applied to it.  These documents, however, describe protection systems that
only use a form of hard armor.  They do not use any kind of reactive devices or deformable membranes to further protect vehicle occupants.
 On the other hand, U.S.  Patent Application No. 2007/0017361 describes an active armor system having two layers, where if the outer layer is attacked by projectile, one or more shaped charges are detonated in the opposite direction to degrade
the effectiveness of the projectile.  This system can be used on a lightly armored vehicle or retrofitted onto an unarmored vehicle.  Likewise, U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,345,563 describes a reactive armor system that contains armor plates with wells.  Within
each well, several holes hide explosive pills.  When one pill is detonated by a projectile, several pills around it are also detonated by means of an explosive sheet.  This armor system can be used for the bottom of a tank for protection against
armor-piercing land mines.  However, while these protection systems use reactive elements and outer shields, they do not use an additional deformable membrane layer in between the two components.
 Though all of these devices use armor, reactive explosive devices, or a combination of both, none of the aforementioned documents combine armor, a deformable membrane, and reactive blocks to protect the vehicle's occupants from land mines or
improvised explosive devices.  To minimize the danger to a vehicle's occupants, the protection system should not only provide an armor shield and reactive elements, but it should utilize a deformable membrane in between the armor and reactive elements to
trap residual explosive elements.
 Thus, there remains a need for a vehicle armor system that adequately protects occupants from land mines and improvised explosive devices.

having a contoured surface; a membrane juxtapositioned below the arc member contoured surface; reactive blocks constructed and configured outside the membrane away from the arc member; and an enclosure for covering the reactive blocks; wherein the arc
member is attached with the contoured surface facing downwardly; thereby providing a protective system for shielding and deflecting an explosive force away from the arc member to protect passengers in a vehicle.
 Methods for protecting vehicle occupants from external explosive forces and materials, in particular where positioned on or under the ground such that a vehicle passing overtop of it would be exposed to the force upwardly, the methods including
the steps of providing an apparatus attached to a vehicle underside to provide the protective system having an arc member having a contoured surface; a membrane juxtapositioned below the arc member contoured surface; reactive blocks constructed and
configured outside the membrane away from the arc member; and an enclosure for covering the reactive blocks; wherein the system functions to actively and passively shield the vehicle occupants from the external explosive force below the vehicle,
including automatically activating the reactive blocks when an external explosive force occurs underneath the vehicle surface, whether the vehicle is moving or stopped.
 Referring now to the drawings in general, the illustrations are for the purpose of describing a preferred embodiment of the invention and are not intended to limit the invention thereto.  As best seen in FIG. 1, an armor system 110 constructed
according to the present invention is shown from a perspective view, the system being attached to a vehicle 105 for protecting vehicle occupants from an explosive device beneath the vehicle by passively and actively shielding, deflecting and redirecting
the explosion away from those occupants; the system is also shown from a cross-sectional view, detached from or not connected to a vehicle in FIG. 2.
 The armor system 110 in FIG. 1 is mounted directly underneath the occupants of a vehicle 105; in a preferred embodiment provided by way of example and to provide corresponding dimensions to illustrate the present invention but not limit it
thereto, the system is shown mounted to a vehicle, in particular to a Humvee.  The armor system of the present intention may be adapted to other vehicles, including transport trucks and VIP vehicles; in these alternative embodiments, the armor system
would need to be scaled accordingly.  The location, construction and configuration of the armor system predominately preserves the safety of the occupants with little concern about the ultimate condition of the vehicle after an explosion, i.e., the
protective system does not provide shielding for overall vehicle body itself.  Preferably the armor system is bonded, mechanically fastened, welded, or placed on rails to mount to the bottom of the vehicle.  If the system is releasably attached to the
vehicle, then it may also be removed and used in defense of people outside the vehicle against, for instance, small arms or rocket attack.
 Key components of the protective system according to the present invention include an arc member, a membrane, reactive blocks, and an enclosure for covering the reactive blocks, all constructed and configured in appropriate relation for
providing a protective system for shielding and deflecting an explosive force to protect passengers in a vehicle.  This listing order defines their preferred order and configuration, listed from the mounting surface underneath a vehicle outwardly,
respectively.  As illustrated in FIG. 2 by way of example, an arc member 210 is the base or foundational component of the armor system 110 that is mounted to the underside of a vehicle 105 (attachment illustrated in FIG. 1); the total apparatus height is
between about 12 and about 15 inches, preferably about 13 inches as shown in the figures.  Preferably, the arc member is mounted directly to the underside of the vehicle and positioned continuously and completely underneath the driver and passenger
seating area, with the arc member having an arc or contoured surface that presents a substantially concave surface facing downwardly away from the vehicle (toward the ground or driving surface).  In alternatively embodiments, additional coverage for
rearward passengers and/or cargo is provided, with the arc member being constructed and configured to shield and deflect explosive forces downwardly away from the passenger seating area directly above the arc member.  Approximately 16 of clearance exists
between the bottom of the example vehicle, a Humvee, and the ground, as illustrated in the figures.  This clearance distance or space provides room for the other key components of the system, namely the membrane, reactive blocks, and the enclosure, all
of which are mounted to the arc member.  The arc member 210 is preferably attached to the underside of a vehicle 105 in FIG. 1 by any suitable means to provide secure attachment, such as welding, bolting, bolted clamps, a track and slide mechanism,
clamps, adhesive, and combinations thereof; more preferably, the arc member is retrofittable to any existing vehicle, and correspondingly the attachment is selected accordingly.  The arc member is also concave and faces downward to contain the explosion
and diverge fragments and shrapnel, where fragments are missiles that may be torn from an explosion and shrapnel are preformed pieces of metal placed in or around an explosive.  Furthermore, the arc member has no joints or seams; instead, it is a
continuous surface and has a unitary, integral construction in order to preserve its continuous nature and to ensure maximum shielding and deflection from an external explosive force.
 The arc has an inner length, measuring from endpoint to endpoint, that is approximately about one inch shorter than the length of the vehicle's occupant compartment.  An outer length is approximately the same length as the vehicle's occupant
compartment.  In the case of the Humvee example, the arc has an inner length that is about 47 inches, and an outer length that is about 48 inches.  Similarly, the width of the arc is substantially approximately the same width as the vehicle to which it
is attached to ensure maximum shielding effect of the overall system.  As shown in the figures and attached to a Humvee, the arc member is about 86 inches in width, which is approximately the distance to fully shield the driver and adjacent passenger
spaces for that example vehicle; relative height being about 13 inches The radius of the arc depends on the full length or distance of the vehicle intended to be protected with the apparatus of the present invention, and the ground clearance of the
vehicle.  The radius of the arc when attached to a Humvee is between about 50 and about 60 inches, more preferably between about 54 and about 56 inches, and still more preferably about 56.039 inches.
 Preferably, the arc member is formed from a hard ceramic material.  Boron carbide, the fifth hardest material on the Mohs scale and characterized by its chemical resistance, nuclear properties, and low density, is one possible compound to
consider when manufacturing the arc.  Other possible arc materials include composites and ceramic composites.  Other materials that can be used for forming the arc member include alumina, silicone carbide, titanium boride, and aluminium nitride.
 Constructed and configured below the arc member 210 as illustrated in FIG. 2 is a deformable membrane 220 that envelops explosion elements such as fragments and shrapnel.  The membrane is positioned on top of the reactive block enclosure 230. 
This location is also above the apexes of the top layer of pyramids in reactive blocks 240.  Consequently, an empty space exits between the arc 210 and the membrane 220.
 In one embodiment of the present invention, the membrane is optionally combined with the enclosure where both the membrane and the enclosure are made of the same material.  By way of example and not limitation, a Lexan box formed with the
reactive blocks disposed therein, with the box surrounded by the enclosure.
 The membrane is formed from polycarbonate resin thermoplastic (one such preferably material is sold as LEXAN.RTM.) or another type of viscoelastic material with similar functionality and characteristics.  Preferably the membrane is formed from a
highly durable polycarbonate resin thermoplastic material of the type that is most notably used in canopies of fighter aircraft, water bottles, etc.
 Positioned underneath the membrane 220 are reactive blocks 240 (shown in the various FIGS. 2, 3, and 4), which function to neutralize external explosive forces, such as those from a single 155 mm shell explosive or 155 mm shell explosives ""daisy
chained"" together.  A single reactive block 240 further comprises pyramids 310, 320, and 330 in FIGS. 3 and 4.  The three pyramids are stacked upon each other as shown in FIG. 3.  A multiplicity of the single reactive blocks are provided in spaced apart
distributed relation across a space that substantially matches the dimensions of the arc member foundation (length and width).
 Pyramids 310 and 330 in FIGS. 3 and 4 are made of ATI 425 titanium, a high-strength alloy known for its hot and cold workability.  Pyramid 320 is made of an explosive material, such as PBX, RDX, or HMX (Octogen) compositions, or the like. 
Preferably, it is a PBX (plastic-bonded explosive) having RDX (Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) and plasticizers as a component, which results in an extremely light chemical composition.  The reaction that produces this explosion is triggered by a
shockwave from a land mine or improvised explosive device.  A shockwave is a high-pressure wave that moves through a material at a faster speed than the speed of sound within that material.  Thus, small arms fire or the equivalent would not detonate the
reactive explosion of pyramid 320 since it does not produce a shockwave.  Small arms fire would simply melt a small amount of explosive in the pyramid 320, slowly oxidizing it at a sub-sonic level and not the super-sonic level needed for detonation.
 The term burn and detonate are very commonly used but many people don't really know the mechanics involved when using the terminology.  When a material burns the oxidation takes place slowly at a sub-sonic level.  Detonation however, burns the
material at a supersonic rate.  This is why small arms fire won't trigger the device.
 The previously mentioned reactive blocks 240 are housed in an enclosure 230 in FIG. 2.  In a preferred embodiment, it holds an array of about 8 reactive blocks by about 12 reactive blocks.  In such an embodiment, the enclosure is box-shaped and
mounted to the bottom of the arc member 210.  It covers the opening of the arc member 210 to form a covering or lid under the membrane 220.  However, the enclosure is releasably attached to the arc member such that it is operable to move during an
explosion to further dissipate the explosion's energy.  The enclosure is preferably made of Lexan, titanium, aluminum, or composite materials.  The enclosure can be mechanically fastened or bonded to the arc member.
 Preferably, the apparatus is retrofittable to existing vehicles for providing the hybrid protecting that is both active and passive, provided by the components of the apparatus set forth hereinabove.  When installed or mounted to a vehicle, the
present invention functions to automatically activate the active protection when an external explosive force occurs underneath the vehicle, either stopped or moving.  When moving, as the motor vehicle 105 illustrated in FIG. 1 passes over a land mine or
improvised explosive device that is ground-based or positioned on the ground, the explosive typically detonates once the pressure applied from above it, such as by a vehicle's tire, is relieved.  The explosive then sends energy in the form of a shockwave
and heat upward and into the underside of a vehicle 105.  Elements of the explosion first come into contact with the armor system 110 in FIGS. 1 and 2 via the first layer of pyramids 330 in FIGS. 3 and 4, which reside in the reactive block enclosure 230
in FIG. 2.  This layer of pyramids that forms the reactive blocks then directs the explosion energy into the pyramid apexes.  The pressure from this energy automatically triggers a smart sensor 350 and detonates the second layer of pyramids 320 in FIGS.
3 and 4.  This reaction creates another explosion that functions to neutralize and counteract the initial shockwave of the land mine or improvised explosive device explosion.  The third layer of pyramids 310 then further redirects the remaining energy of
the initial explosion into its apexes.  By this point, the majority of the initial explosion's energy is substantially defused.
 However, fragments and shrapnel from the initial explosion and fragments caused by the reactive explosion of the second layer of pyramids 320 may still be a threat to occupants of a vehicle 105 in FIG. 1.  Thus, the present invention functions
to ensure that fragments and the third layer of pyramids are degraded and trapped in the membrane 220 in FIG. 2 that lies above the apexes of the top layer of pyramids 310, illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4.  Furthermore, if any remaining fragments and
shrapnel continue to travel upward past the membrane 220 in FIG. 2, the arc 210 is constructed and configured to provide an additional and possibly last line of defense for the vehicle occupants from an explosion; the arc functions to completely block
these fragments from entering the occupant compartment of a vehicle 105 in FIG. 1, thereby shielding the occupants completely from any fragments that have not already been handled by the system of the present invention.  Consequently, the vehicle may be
damaged or rendered inoperable after a land mine or improvised explosive device explosion, but the vehicle occupants are shielded and safe from harm by the underside or land-based explosive device.
 According to one embodiment of the present invention, some of individual components of the present invention are individually shown in FIGS. 5-7.  FIG. 5 is a perspective view of the membrane 220.  FIG. 6 is a perspective view of the enclosure
230.  And, FIG. 7 is a perspective view of the arc member 210.
 FIG. 8 is a perspective view of the protective apparatus 110 shown in FIG. 2.  Reactive blocks 240 are contained within the enclosure (not shown) and positioned below the membrane 220 and subsequently below arc member 210.
 FIGS. 9 and 10 illustrate the mounting and orientation of one embodiment of the present invention.  FIG. 9 is a front view of the armor system 110 including the protective apparatus attached to a vehicle 105 shown in FIG. 1.  FIG. 10 is a front
view of the arc member 210 attached to a vehicle 105 according to one embodiment of the present invention.  This illustrates the orientation of the armor system with respect to the vehicle according to one embodiment of the present invention.
 Certain modifications and improvements will occur to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the foregoing description.  By way of example, protective skirts can be added to the sides of the armor system to protect bystanders near the vehicle
from discharged elements should an explosive detonate under the vehicle.  Also, a larger arc or a combination of connected arcs can be used to cover the entire underside of a vehicle instead of just a single arc covering the occupant compartment in the
present invention.  Similarly, the present invention could be placed at a different location on a vehicle than directly under the occupant compartment.
 Furthermore, sensors may be added to the enclosure or near the reactive blocks of the present invention to detect lands mines or improvised explosive devices near the vehicle.  This improvement to the present invention would be beneficial in
situations where the vehicle is left unattended for a period of time, allowing a person to set up a land mine or improvised explosive device near the vehicle.
 An additional modification to the present invention could be a higher packing density of reactive blocks.  This can be achieved by inverting half of the reactive blocks and alternating non-inverted and inverted reactive blocks within the
reactive block enclosure.  The inverted blocks use the same principle as the non-inverted blocks but have a slightly different geometry.  This embodiment will not alter the direction of the reactive explosions in the second layer of pyramids because the
explosive force will act equally in all directions.
 Still another embodiment of the present invention includes applying multiple apparatus in series or in spaced apart relation for protecting an extended region of the vehicle.  The arc span extends across the region to be principally protected;
multiple arcs or extended arc span for a given arc member extends the protected region of the vehicle.
 The above mentioned examples are provided to serve the purpose of clarifying the aspects of the invention and it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that they do not serve to limit the scope of the invention.  All modifications and
improvements have been deleted herein for the sake of conciseness and readability but are properly within the scope of the following claims.

     detected. A signal from an emitter outside the vehicle signals occupant
     presence. A photoelectric and/or optical device, audio receiver, and/or
     touch-sensitive sensor detects the response. The optical device projects
     a light beam, and breaking the beam with a gesture signals the response.
     An automatic closure panel opening apparatus has an RF receiver adapted
     to receive an RF signal to detect occupant presence, a sensor for
     detecting the occupant response, and an actuator for opening the closure
     panel when both the presence and occupant response are detected. A method
     for automatically opening the closure panel includes detecting an
     occupant presence and response, and automatically opening the closure
     panel when a predetermined response is detected.

power-assisted actuation of one or more vehicle closure panels.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Conventional automotive vehicles are typically entered by lifting or pulling on an exterior door handle to thereby actuate a lever contained within the door, thereby unlatching the door so that it may freely pivot about a hinge mechanism. 
Modern vehicle doors may include a remote access device such as a push-button key fob that an occupant may activate a short distance away from the vehicle in order to automatically unlock one or more vehicle doors.  Certain vehicles such as minivans may
include one or more power sliding side doors, which may be similarly activated using a button on the inside of the vehicle or on a push-button fob.  With such remote access devices, vehicle doors automatically lock or unlock, and sometimes open and
close, at the touch of a button, thus simplifying entry to and egress from the vehicle.  Additionally, passive entry mechanisms are also available with certain vehicles to allow automatic unlocking of an exterior door upon detection of the proximate
presence of the passive entry mechanism.
 While such remote access and passive entry devices are useful for some purposes, they may prove less than optimally efficient under certain circumstances.  For example, when using a standard manual door handle, at least one hand must remain free
or unencumbered in order to exert sufficient force on the door handle.  Likewise, the use of a button on a key fob requires depressing one or more buttons on the key fob, usually using a finger or thumb.  However, when an occupant approaches a vehicle
with full arms, such as when holding a child, or bags of groceries, packages, or other similar items, or with limited personal mobility, the manual actuation of a door handle and/or the depression of a manual button on a key fob may prove to be a
challenging maneuver.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 Accordingly, a vehicle is provided having a closure panel and an actuator configured for automatically opening and/or closing the closure panel.  At least one presence sensor is configured for detecting the presence of a potential occupant of
the vehicle, and at least one occupant response sensor is configured for detecting an occupant response.  The vehicle includes a controller having a stored expected occupant response, with the controller being operable for comparing the detected
occupant's response to the stored expected occupant response, and for activating the actuator to open or close the closure panel when the presence is detected and the detected occupant response equals the stored expected occupant response.
 In one aspect of the invention, the first sensor is a radio frequency (RF) receiver adapted to receive an RF signal emitted by an RF emitter positioned external to the vehicle.
 In another aspect of the invention, the second sensor is an optical presence sensor, an audio receiver, an ultrasonic sensor, a laser sensor, and/or a touch-sensitive sensor.
 In another aspect of the invention, the occupant response sensor has an emitter for projecting a light beam onto a surface, with the detected occupant response being interference with the path of the light beam using a gesture.
 In another aspect of the invention, the emitter generates a customizable logo and projects the logo onto the surface.
 In another aspect of the invention, the occupant response sensor is an audio receiver and the vehicle includes voice recognition software, with the expected occupant response being a predetermined word or phrase spoken by the occupant.
 In another aspect of the invention, an automatic closure panel opening apparatus is provided for use a vehicle having a closure panel and an actuator configured for automatically opening the closure panel.  The apparatus includes an RF receiver
adapted to receive an RF signal from an RF emitter positioned external to the vehicle to thereby detect the presence of an occupant of the vehicle, at least one sensor for detecting an occupant response, and a controller operable for comparing the
detected occupant response to the stored expected occupant response, and for activating the actuator when the presence is detected and when the detected occupant response equals the stored expected occupant response.
 In another aspect of the invention, a method for automatically opening a vehicle closure panel includes detecting the presence of an occupant of the vehicle, alerting the occupant that the presence has been detected, detecting an occupant
response, comparing the detected occupant response to a stored expected occupant response, and automatically opening or closing the vehicle closure panel when the detected occupant response equals the stored expected occupant response.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in FIG. 1 a vehicle 10 having a power-assisted or automatically actuatable side door or closure
panel 14A.  Closure panel 14A as shown in FIG. 1 is a preferred side-swinging side entry vehicle door having a window 11, although any moveable vehicle closure panel may be used in accordance with the invention, for example a rear lift glass and/or lift
gate 14B, a gas cap door 14C, a power sliding door (not shown), trunk (not shown), hood (not shown), or an internal closure such as a glove box or console (not shown).  For simplicity, preferred closure panel 14A will be referred to hereinafter.
 Closure panel 14A is operatively and/or electrically connected to an actuator mechanism or actuator 54 that is configured or adapted to automatically move closure panel 14A, as represented by bidirectional arrow A, to thereby open and/or close
closure panel 14A as described in detail hereinbelow.  Vehicle 10 as shown in FIG. 1 is a sport utility vehicle (SUV) having a hinged or swing-type closure panel 14A, however vehicle 10 may be any type of passenger or cargo vehicle equipped with one or
more closure panels 14A.  Additionally, vehicle 10 is preferably provided with an obstacle detection means, such as a light-touch or a non-contact obstacle detection means, sufficient for detecting the presence of an obstacle (not shown) within the path
or range of motion of closure panel 14A, with controller 32 being operable for modifying the movement of closure panel 14A in response to such obstacle detection in order to avoid or minimize contact with an obstacle.
 Within the scope of the invention, actuator 54 may be any hydraulic, electromechanical, rack and pinion, sector gear, electromagnetic, electromechanical-pneumatic, electromechanical-hydraulic, and/or other automatic or power-assisted actuating
device or system capable of alternately exerting a sufficient opening and/or a sufficient closing force on closure panel 14A as needed.  Preferably, actuator 54 is operable in its most basic embodiment for ""popping open"" closure panel 14A, i.e. opening
closure panel 14A a sufficient distance to enable an occupant 12 or other passenger or user of the vehicle 10 to insert an elbow or other suitable body part or object partially into vehicle 10 to thereby leverage closure panel 14A and open it completely. This capability is particularly desirable in the event occupant 12 has full arms or hands as shown in FIG. 1, or other situations in which the use of hands requires an impossible, difficult, or undesirable maneuver.  For example, a spring and/or powered
release pin, latch, and/or other mechanism suitable for achieving the ""pop open"" or ajar position may be used alone or in conjunction with actuator 54 and closure panel 14A.  Additionally, actuator 54 and/or closure panel 14A are also preferably operable
for holding open or sustaining an ajar position of closure panel 14A, for example via a detent in a conventional, integral, or continuous check link.
 In addition to the basic ""pop-open"" functionality described hereinabove, actuator 54 is preferably selectively operable for automatically powering closure panel 14A to either or both of a fully opened and a fully closed position.  Depending on
the particular construction of closure panel 14A, actuator 54 may also include a multi-power option, i.e. a power-assisted or automatic opening and/or closing of closure panel 14A through multiple directions, planes, or geometries.  This may occur, for
example, by the pivoting or swinging of closure panel 14A through a portion of the available range of motion of closure panel 14A, and then sliding or rolling through another portion of the available range of motion of closure panel 14A via linkages,
tracks, guide rails, or other comparable mechanisms as needed.
 Likewise, an actuation device or mechanism (not shown) such as a button, lever, knob, or other similar device or mechanism is preferably positioned at a convenient location within vehicle 10 (see FIG. 1), and may be manually depressed to open or
close closure panel 14A as previously described hereinabove.  Actuator 54 may also be configured for closing closure panel 14A once occupant 12 has traveled a sufficient predetermined distance away from vehicle 10, such as by sensing the proximity of
occupant 12.  Integral situational programmability and occupant-input options may be included to ensure an occupant-preferred response in a particular predetermined situation, such as while parking in a garage or other such confined space.  Finally,
instantaneous occupant override or bypass capability is preferably available to occupant 12 at all times, for example by an attended control operation or functionality similar to the attendant operation of a power window switch, or via a bypass mode
temporarily enabling only a standard or manual operation of closure panel 14A if so desired.
 Still referring to FIG. 1, vehicle 10 includes a programmable control module or controller 32 that is programmed or otherwise configured to detect both the presence of a potential occupant 12, such as a potential driver or passenger of vehicle
10, and a predetermined occupant response upon such detection.  To that end, when vehicle 10 is approached by occupant 12 having limited use or mobility of his or her hands such as depicted in FIG. 1, an emitter 25 transmits or emits a signal 28 that is
recognizable by controller 32 as uniquely identifying occupant 12.  Emitter 25 is preferably a radio-frequency (RF) emitter sized to be easily carried on or within a key chain, fob, tag, or similarly transportable device.  Vehicle 10 is therefore
equipped with an RF receiver 30, along with an audio receiver 41 described later hereinbelow, positioned at an appropriate location on or within the body of vehicle 10, for example housed or contained within an integrated antenna 29, which is shown for
illustrative purposes in FIG. 1 as a convex structure, but which in operation would preferably be integrated into the structure of vehicle 10, such as an external body panel, so as not to be visible or readily discernable.  Alternately, RF receiver 30
may be positioned on a B-pillar 18, a rear view mirror housing 13, a handle 15 of closure panel 14A, along a bottom 16 of closure panel 14A, and/or other suitable location on or within vehicle 10.  Vehicle 10 may also include a touch-sensitive sensor 43,
as will be described later hereinbelow with reference to FIG. 3.
 Signal 28 is preferably confined to a limited bandwidth, and/or sufficiently modulated or otherwise securely encoded to ensure the uniqueness of signal 28 with respect to occupant 12.  Signal 28 may be user-selected or randomly generated using a
rolling code in synchronization with RF receiver 30.  Preferably, the bandwidth of the signal generated by emitter 25, and the tuned frequency of RF receiver 30, are configured to provide a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio at a distance of
approximately 5 to 10 feet from vehicle 10, or at a similar distance to that currently used to actuate an automatic lock using a standard key fob, so that proper authentication of occupant 12 may occur while occupant 12 is still positioned within a
comfortable range or distance from vehicle 10.
 Turning to FIG. 2, controller 32 is shown having sufficient memory 34, with memory 34 containing optional voice recognition software 49 and a method or algorithm 100.  Voice recognition software 49 is described later hereinbelow with reference
to FIG. 3, and algorithm 100 is described later hereinbelow with reference to FIG. 5, with algorithm 100 including all of the necessary control logic required to enable the invention.  As explained hereinabove, emitter 25, also labeled ""E"" in FIG. 2, is
preferably an RF emitter, and signal 28 is preferably a unique RF signal having a relatively narrow or restricted bandwidth.  RF receiver 30, also labeled ""R"" in FIG. 2, is preferably tunable to the specific frequency or bandwidth of signal 28.  One or
more occupant response sensors 40, also labeled ""S"" in FIG. 2, are in electrical communication with controller 32, such as via hard wiring 46 and/or via datalink, and are initiated or activated upon receipt of signal 28 to thereby detect a predetermined
occupant response.
 Turning to FIG. 3, occupant response sensors 40 may include one or more of an audio receiver 41, a photoelectric or optical sensor 42, a touch-sensitive sensor 43, an ultrasonic sensor 44, and/or a laser sensor 45, each of which is operable
alone or in conjunction with the other sensors 40 to detect or otherwise determine a response of occupant 12 (see FIG. 1).  The term ""occupant response"" as used herein refers to a response of occupant 12, such as a spoken or physical command, gesture, or
series of gestures or commands, used to signal approval of execution of a particular predetermined vehicle response, such as the locking/unlocking and/or opening/closing of closure panel 14A.
 Audio receiver 41 may be any sensory device or system capable of capturing a unique audible sound, word, and/or phrase spoken by occupant 12, and of relaying the captured or detected audio data to controller 32, where it is compared to a
previously recorded or stored expected sound, word, and/or phrase, such as by using voice recognition software 49 stored in memory 34 (also see FIG. 2).  Audio receiver 41 is preferably integrated into RF receiver 30 with an integrated antenna 29, as
shown in FIG. 1, to maximize component efficiency, but which also may be a separate device as deemed appropriate by a user of the invention.  The stored expected occupant response is preferably variably user-programmable or selectable, and stored within
memory 34 of controller 32 to allow customization.  Optical sensor 42 may be any sensory device or system capable of photo electrically and/or optically detecting the relative position and/or motion of occupant 12 relative to the position of optical
sensor 42.
 Turning briefly to FIG. 4a, optical sensor 42 may utilize a combination of an emitter 47A and a receiver 47B (see FIG. 4a).  Such an emitter 47A may take the form of a laser projection diode or module capable of generating and projecting a
concentrated light beam 20 (see FIGS. 4a and 4b) onto a stationary surface, such as surface 19 of the ground on which vehicle 10 rests or an internal surface (not shown) within vehicle 10, with receiver 47B being capable of detecting the presence,
absence, and/or directional motion of an object or body part by detecting the breaking, interference with, or interruption of light beam 20, as will be discussed in detail hereinbelow.
 As described above regarding audio receiver 41, a stored expected occupant response is preferably preprogrammed, selected, or otherwise stored in memory 34 of controller 32, with controller 32 being operable for comparing the occupant response
detected by optical sensor 42 to the stored expected occupant response or responses to determine their equivalence or sameness.  Alternately, as shown in the FIG. 4b, emitter 47A may be used in conjunction with one or more ultrasonic sensors 44
positioned at or in proximity to vehicle underside 56, in lieu of or in combination with receiver 47B, as described hereinbelow.
 Turning back to FIG. 3, touch-sensitive sensor 43 (also see FIG. 1) may be any touch or proximity sensitive button, pad, surface, or other such pressure, proximity, and/or heat-sensitive surface positioned on or within vehicle 10, and which
occupant 12 may touch or approach with any object or body part to signal his or her intended response, such as by touching or pressing an elbow to an exposed pad or surface (not shown) in the event of having full hands.  Additionally, touch-sensitive
sensor 43 may incorporate vibration sensing capabilities, such as the ability to detect the presence or change in a natural or an induced vibration on an operatively connected flat surface, such as window 11 (see FIG. 1), a relatively flat surface of
closure panel 14A, or another similar and appropriate surface of vehicle 10.
 Alternately, touch-sensitive sensor 43 may include electromagnetic field (EMF) sensing capabilities, i.e. the ability to detect an interruption or change in a generated EMF generated around touch-sensitive sensor 43, and/or a capacitance
dimensional sensor of the type known in the art that is operable for detecting a change in capacitance between two proximate conductors, i.e. a body part of occupant 12, or an object held by occupant 12, and touch-sensitive sensor 43, upon the proximate
approach of the object or body part.  As described hereinabove regarding audio receiver 41 and optical sensor 42, a stored expected occupant response is preferably preprogrammed, selected, or otherwise stored in memory 34 of controller 32, with
controller 32 being operable for comparing the occupant response detected by touch-sensitive device 43 to the stored expected occupant response or responses to determine their equivalence or sameness.
 Finally, laser sensor 45 is any laser sensor capable of generating a concentrated beam of blue, green, red, and/or infrared light, such as available using conventional laser diodes.  Emitter 47A (see FIGS. 4a and 4b) of optical sensor 42 and
laser sensor 45 may utilize shared laser technology or components to minimize the number of components used.  Laser sensor 45 in particular is preferably operable at least for detecting a discrete, non-patterned gesture, such as interruption or breakage
of a generated beam such as light beam 20 (see FIGS. 4a and 4b) from any direction.  Laser sensor 45 preferably is a Vertical Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) of the type known in the art in order to maximize reliability while minimizing costs and
power consumption.
 Turning to FIG. 4a, an illustration of a preferred optical sensor 42 is shown having an emitter and detector 47A and 47B, respectively.  Emitter 47A is configured to generate a light beam 20, such as a red, green, blue, or infrared laser or
other suitably concentrated beam of light as described hereinabove, separately or in conjunction with laser sensor 45, and to project light beam 20 as a specific ""hot spot"" or detection zone marker onto surface 19.  Emitter 47A and detector 47B may each
be attached to a suitable location, such as underside 56 of vehicle 10 (see FIG. 1), closure panel 14A, or alternately attached or positioned on or near other vehicle components, such as to rear-view mirror 13, handle 15 (see FIG. 1), or at any other
suitable position on the exterior of vehicle 10.
 According to one embodiment, emitter 47A may be configured to project a customizable logo 21 onto surface 19, with customization of logo 21 preferably being easily user-definable via programming of controller 32 (see FIGS. 1 and 2).  For
example, logo 21 may include the name or initials of occupant 12, a company logo, crest, personal photograph, and/or any other image or writing desired by a user of the invention to provide a personal, customizable experience.  In the event a customized
logo 21 is not desired, occupant 12 preferably has the option of turning off the customized logo, in which case light beam 20 would simply form a spot of light on surface 19.  Once occupant 12 has learned the location of logo 21, occupant 12 preferably
has the option of shifting emitter 47A to an invisible spectrum, such as infrared, or turning off emitter 47A entirely to thereby enter a ""stealth"" mode so that light beam 20 and logo 21 would not be detectable to a casual observer.
 Once light beam 20 is projected onto surface 19, occupant 12 signals his or her intent with regard to automatically unlocking and/or opening of closure panel 14A, and/or another closure panel or closure panel equipped according to the invention,
by making a gesture, usually with a foot 12A, as represented by arrow B. A ""gesture"" may be the interrupting, interference with, or breaking of light beam (see arrow C of the bottom illustration of FIG. 4) by moving a foot 12A in a specific direction or
pattern of directions through the path of light beam 20.  Alternately, a ""gesture"" may be selectively limited or fixed to equal the interrupting of light beam 20 from any direction, i.e. by stepping on the surface 19 within the path of the light beam 20. A specific expected gesture may programmed or stored in memory 34 of controller 32, and may be as simple or as complex as desired by occupant 12 in order to provide a unique coded command for ensuring security of vehicle 10 (see FIG. 1), thus minimizing
the chances of unauthorized or unintended entry of vehicle 10.
 Alternately, emitter 47A may be used in conjunction with one or more ultrasonic sensors 44 (also see FIG. 3), with ultrasonic sensors 44 providing the sensing capability and emitter 47A, marking only the precise location, ""hot spot"", or path of
ultrasonic detection waves 48, which are shown in FIG. 4b.  Occupant 12 may then gesture in the path of light beam 20 marked by customizable logo 21 to signal an occupant response.  Accordingly, ultrasonic sensors 44 are preferably operable for detecting
a gesture of occupant 12 by sensing and measuring an interruption or disturbance in ultrasonic detection waves 48, preferably via their measurable reflection (represented in FIG. 4 by arrows D) off of an object in the path of ultrasonic detection waves
48, such as a foot 12A.  Preferably, a sufficient number of ultrasonic sensors 44 are used to properly determine or measure accurate time and directional information of the gesture of occupant 12, and to thereby accurately determine the response of
occupant 12 for comparison to the stored expected response.
 With a sufficient number of optical sensors 42 and/or ultrasonic sensors 44, logo 21 described hereinabove may also include or take the form of a graphic representation of all available responses of closure panel 14, and/or multiple closure
panels 14 or other closures usable with the invention.  For example, symbols or text indicative of various closure panels 14A, gas cap covers 14C, or lift gate 14B (see FIG. 1), or other interior closures such as glove compartment doors, may be projected
onto surface 19, with occupant 12 merely having to step on a particular projected symbol to thereby signal to controller 32 to open the corresponding closure, as described hereinabove.
 In order to ensure that closure panel 14A opens only when desired, and does not automatically open simply because occupant 12 carries emitter 25 in proximity to vehicle 10, controller 32 is preferably adapted to default to a second predetermined
vehicle response after passage of a designated interval or duration.  After receiving no response within the designated duration, such as 5 to 10 seconds, or after receiving an incorrect or unrecognized response when compared to a stored expected
occupant response, closure panel 14A is preferably unlocked and/or opened, or locked and/or closed, only using standard available methods, such as a key fob button or closure panel key.  However, as the second predetermined vehicle response is
determinable by occupant 12 and programmable into controller 32, the actual vehicle response may be any response desired by occupant 12, such as unlocking, locking, and/or complete or partial opening or closing of one or more closure panels 14A or other
closures.
 Alternately, audio receiver 41 (see FIGS. 2 and 3) as described hereinabove may capture or detect a spoken sound, word, or phrase of occupant 12 and relay the captured data to controller 32.  Using audio receiver 41, a spoken sound, word, or
phrase of occupant 12 may be used in place of or in addition to a gesture (arrow B of FIG. 4) to signal the occupant response.  For example, occupant 12 may signal the desire to open or close closure panel 14A with a gesture, and by using a spoken word
or phrase may signal unlocking a different closure panel, trunk, or other such closure.
 Similarly, touch-sensitive sensor 43 (see FIGS. 1 and 3) may be used in place of or in addition to a gesture and/or audio receiver 41 to signal the desired vehicle response.  In this instance, occupant 12 may signal a desire to open or close
closure panel 14A with a bump or touch of an elbow against or near touch-sensitive sensor 43, but use a unique gesture and/or spoken word or phrase to signal for the unlocking/locking and/or opening/closing of a separate closure panel, trunk, or other
such vehicle closure.
 Turning to FIG. 5, algorithm 100 of the invention is shown, with algorithm 100 being programmed or otherwise stored in memory 34 of controller 32 (see FIG. 2).  Algorithm 100 begins with step 102, with controller 32 detecting the proximate
presence of occupant 12 (see FIG. 1), or more precisely, of emitter 25 on the person of occupant 12.  As previously described hereinabove, detection step 102 is preferably accomplished using RF receiver 30 that is positioned in an appropriate location on
or within vehicle 10.  Once the presence of occupant 12 has been detected or otherwise verified, algorithm 100 proceeds to step 104.
 At step 104, algorithm 100 alerts occupant 12 of successful detection (see step 102) and the activation of one of the various occupant response sensors 40 (see FIG. 3).  Such activation may occur in conjunction with a visible and/or audible
alarm or indicator (not shown), or in the instance of optical sensor 42, by way of customizable logo 21 (see FIG. 4).  In this way, occupant 12 is made aware of both his or her detected presence and the activation of one or more occupant response sensors
40.  Algorithm 100 then proceeds to step 106.
 At step 106, algorithm 100 detects the occupant response.  As described hereinabove, such a response may take the form of a gesture (arrow B of FIG. 4a), and/or a spoken word or phrase, and/or contact with a touch-sensitive sensor 43.  Once an
occupant response is detected, or after passage of a preset duration without a detected occupant response, algorithm 100 proceeds to step 108.
 At step 108, algorithm 100 compares the detected occupant response (or passage of preset duration) to stored expected occupant response or responses in memory 34.  In the event that the detected occupant response equals a predetermined occupant
response, algorithm 100 proceeds to step 110.  In the event the detected occupant response does not equal the predetermined occupant response, algorithm 100 proceeds to step 112.  This may occur when, for example, motion of a foot 12A (see FIG. 4) across
light beam 20 is detected in a right-to-left direction when the stored expected gesture is the motion of the same foot 12A in the opposite or left-to-right direction.  Likewise, algorithm 100 proceeds to step 112 if a preset duration passes without
detection of any occupant response at all.
 At step 110, algorithm 100 executes a first predetermined vehicle response.  Since at step 108 it was determined that the detected occupant response equals the stored expected occupant response, the ""first predetermined vehicle response"" of
algorithm 100 preferably is the unlocking and/or opening of closure panel 14A automatically, thus allowing for ""hands full"" entry of vehicle 10 (see FIG. 1).  Once inside vehicle 10, occupant 12 may then close closure panel 14A manually or automatically
as desired.
 At step 112, algorithm 100 executes a second predetermined vehicle response.  Since at step 108 is was determined that the detected occupant response did not equal the stored expected occupant response, or that a preset interval of time has
passed without any detected occupant response at all, the ""second predetermined vehicle response"" of algorithm 100 is preferably maintenance of the status quo of closure panel 14.  For example, if closure panel 14A is determined to be locked at the
initiation of occupant detection step 106, at step 112 closure panel 14A preferably will remain locked until occupant 12 unlocks and/or opens closure panel 14A manually or automatically.
 An audio warning may also sound to provide notice that an incorrect or no response was determined.  However, within the scope of the invention both the first and second predetermined vehicle responses may be programmed and modified as desired by
occupant 12.  In this manner, the invention may provide enhanced entry/egress to vehicle 10 without requiring occupant 12 to empty his or her hands, which may also prove beneficial for facilitating access to vehicle 10 by young children, the elderly,
and/or disabled drivers or passengers.
 While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention within the
scope of the appended claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
 Referring to FIGS. 2 through 9, a detachable body and mounting system for a motorcycle trike is shown.
 FIG. 2 is an oblique view of a detachable body 25 for a motorcycle trike 27, which is shown in FIG. 3 from the rear and with body 25 removed.  Trike 27 is constructed similarly to trike 11, described above, and has one front wheel assembly (not
shown) and left and right rear wheel assemblies 29 (both shown in phantom in FIG. 2).  A frame 31 provides for mounting of an engine and drivetrain (neither are shown), seat 33, and suspension components 35.  Trike 27 has fenders 37 for covering rear
wheel assemblies 29.  Fenders 37 are carried by an outboard portion of suspension components 35 and are not directly connected to body 25, allowing fenders 37 to move vertically with wheel assemblies 29 and relative to body 25.
 Body 25 is formed from a rigid material and is preferably formed from a fiber-reinforced plastic, such as a fiberglass or carbon-fiber composite.  Body 25 comprises a trunk section 39, which encloses a trunk volume 41 within a rear portion of
trunk section 39.  An aperture 43 is formed in trunk section 39 and communicates volume 41 with the exterior of body 25.  Aperture 43 may be formed in an upright, rearward-facing portion of trunk section 39, as shown, or aperture 43 may be formed in an
alternative location, such as a top portion of trunk section 39.  A door 45 is installed adjacent volume 41 so as to cover aperture 43 and provide for selective access to volume 41.  Door 45 may be hinged or otherwise connected to trunk section 39 to
provide for movement relative to body 25 to allow access to volume 41, or door 45 may alternatively be configured to allow for removal from body 25.  In FIG. 2, door 45 is shown in phantom in one of the possible open positions, the position shown being
the open position when door 45 is hinged near a lower edge portion of door 45.
 In addition to trunk section 39, the embodiment of body 25 shown in FIG. 2 has a pair of optional suspension covers 47.  Covers 47 may be formed as integral features of body 25 or may be formed as separate components that are attached to trunk
section 39.  Covers 47 extend laterally outward from opposing lateral sides of trunk section 39 for covering suspension components 35.  Covers 47 also extend longitudinally for a selected distance and may extend forward of trunk section 39, as shown in
the present embodiment and visible in the top view of FIG. 6.  As shown, covers 47 are preferably formed to extend over and then in front of and behind suspension components 35, so that components 35 are hidden from view.  Each cover 47 is formed to have
an inner periphery 49 that is shaped to prevent interference with the operation of the drivetrain of trike 27 and allow for movement of suspension components 35 relative to covers 47.  In an alternative embodiment, suspension covers 47 may be formed to
have a greater lateral width to extend over wheel assemblies 29, eliminating the need for separate fenders 37.
 Referring now specifically to FIGS. 3 through 6, a rear mounting system is provided for allowing body 25 to be easily installed and removed from trike 27.  A mounting rack 51 is detachably connected to frame 31 by insertion into a receiver 53,
which is attached to a lower frame rail 55 of frame 31.  Optionally, rack 51 may be releasably retained within receiver 53 using friction or fasteners.  FIG. 4 is an oblique view of rack 51, which comprises a longitudinal central bar 57 and two cross
bars 59, 61.  Cross bars 59, 61 are mounted to central bar 57 so as to be generally perpendicular to central bar 57, cross bars 59, 61 being located toward a rear end portion of central bar 57 and spaced along central bar 57 from each other.  In the
embodiment shown, two fastener components 63 are mounted at opposing outer end portions of cross bar 61.  It is preferred that fastener components 63 are of a twist-lock type or a similar type of fastener that provides for ease of installation and
removal without the use of tools.  In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, fastener components 63 each have a lock feature 65 that is configured to engage a corresponding lock feature 67 on a twist-lock pin 69.  Pin 69 has a slotted head 71 and a ring 73
pivotally attached to head 71, ring 73 providing for the ability of a user to rotate pin 69 without the use of tools.  With the end of pin 69 inserted into component 63, rotation of pin 69 in one direction causes feature 67 to engage feature 65, whereas
rotation in the opposite direction releases pin 69 from component 63.
 FIG. 6 is a top, partial cutaway view of body 25 installed on rack 51.  As mentioned above, rack 51 is releasably inserted into receiver 53, which is mounted to frame 31.  To mount body to rack 51, body is then placed on top of rack 51, with
body centered laterally over central bar 57.  In the embodiment shown, two holes 75 (shown in phantom in FIG. 5) are formed in a lower surface 77 of trunk volume 41 so that each hole 75 is generally coaxial with one of locking features 67 when body 25 is
moved into the desired position.  One of pins 69 is then installed through each of holes 75 from within trunk volume 41 and inserted into a fastener component 63.  Pins 69 may then be rotated without tools to engage lock features 65, 67 with each other,
thereby securing body 25 to rack 51 and to trike 27.  Body 25 may be easily removed from trike 27 by rotating pins 69 to disengage lock features 65, 67 and removing pins from components 63 and from holes 75, allowing body to be removed from rack 51.
 FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate the preferred method for mounting the front of body 25.  A pin 79, such as a bolt or screw, is used to secure a grommet 81 to a lower portion of frame 31 forward of suspension components 35 on each lateral side of frame
31.  Grommet 81 is preferably formed from rubber or a similar elastomeric material to prevent damage or excessive wear to body 25.  As shown, grommet 81 comprises a circumferential groove 83, and a similarly sized and shaped notch 85 is formed in a
trailing edge of a lower portion of the front of each suspension cover 47.  To mount the front portion of body 25, each notch 85 is inserted into groove 83 of the corresponding grommet 81, no tools being required for the installation.  In the embodiment
shown, the order of operations during installation is to mount the forward portion of body 25 on grommets 81 and then to mount the rear portion of body 25 to rack 51, as described above.
 It should be noted that the above description of one embodiment of a detachable body 25 mentions specific types and numbers of fasteners or mounts.  However, it should be noted that more or fewer fasteners and similar alternative means may be
used to mount body 25 to trike 27.  For example, one fastener may be used to attach body 25 to rack 51.  Also, rather than using twist-lock type pins to attach body 25 to rack 51, other types of fasteners not requiring tools to be operated may be used,
e.g., pins having spring-biased detents, friction-type fasteners, etc.
 FIG. 9 shows trike 27 with mounting rack 51 installed in receiver 53 and a drivetrain cover 87 installed on frame 31 rearward of seat 33.  Use of drivetrain cover 87 precludes use of body 25, as described above, as body 25 cannot be mounted to
trike 27 due to interference with cover 87.  However, FIG. 10 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a detachable body 89 for a trike, body 89 being constructed similarly to body 25, described above.  Body 89 has a trunk section 91 and suspension
covers 93 on opposing sides of trunk section 91.  Trunk section 91 encloses a trunk volume (not shown), which can be accessed by opening door 95 in aperture 97.  Body 89 is installed on trike 27 using front and rear mounts like those described above for
body 25.
 To allow for use of a separate drivetrain cover 87 mounted to frame 31, a generally rectangular opening 99 is formed in the front central portion of trunk section 91.  Opening 99 is sized to allow opening 99 to receive cover 87 when body 89 is
installed on trike 27.  Opening 99 is preferably oversized, so that there is minimal or no contact between body 89 and cover 87.
 Another alternative embodiment of a detachable body 101 for a trike is shown in FIG. 11.  Body 101 is constructed similarly to body 25, described above, and installed on trike 27.  Body 101 has an integral drivetrain cover 103 formed on a
central forward portion of a trunk section 105, and suspension covers 107 extend from opposing sides of trunk section 105.  Trunk section 105 encloses a trunk volume (not shown), which can be accessed by opening door 109 in aperture 111.  Body 101 is
installed on trike 27 using front and rear mounts like those described above for body 25.
 Referring again to FIGS. 3 and 9, an optional tail lamp component 113 is shown attached to rack 51.  Component 113 may be mounted in any appropriate manner to rack 51, and electrical wires (not shown) may be run through or around the members of
rack 51 to provide power for operation of component 113.
 The detachable body described above provides several advantages, including: (1) providing a useful body for a trike allowing for storage of items; and (2) providing for easy attachment and detachment of the body.
 FIG. 12 shows an additional embodiment of a detachable body 115 for a trike 117, body having integral fenders 119 that extend over rear wheel assemblies 121, eliminating the need for separate fenders that move with the wheel assemblies, such as
like fenders 37 on trike 27, as described above.  Trike 117 is a tilting type, wherein frame 123 is configured for tilting about a generally longitudinal roll axis during cornering.  Because body 115 is attached to frame 123 and fenders 119 are integral
to body 115, tilting of frame 123 also causes fenders 119 to move vertically relative to wheel assemblies 121.  This motion requires that the upper surface of the inside of each fender 119 be positioned a sufficient height (as measured at zero tilt
angle) above the top of the corresponding wheel assembly 121, as shown, so that the fenders 119 do not contact wheel assemblies 121 when frame 123 is tilted to the maximum angle.  Additional height may be required to ensure that suspension travel caused
by bumps or cornering forces while at the maximum tilt angle do not cause contact between the inside of fenders 119 and wheel assemblies 121.
 While this invention has been described with reference to illustrative embodiments, this description is not intended to be construed in a limiting sense.  Various modifications and combinations of the illustrative embodiments, as well as other
embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description.

",,"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
 This application claims priority to German Patent Application No. 102008029259.1, filed Jun.  19, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
 The invention relates to a fixture element, in particular for motor vehicles, with an upwardly open casing for accommodating at least one receptacle.  The casing exhibits a floor and at least one lateral clamping element, and the casing
incorporates at least one hinged support, which is parallel and spaced apart from the floor in a first latchable setting, as well as essentially perpendicular to the floor in a second setting, and the respective clamping element is further arranged above
the support relative to its first setting.
BACKGROUND
 A fixture element is described in German Patent Application 10 2007 061 203.8.
 At least one object of the present invention is to further develop this fixture element in such a way as to enable a space-saving accommodation of the fixture in its second setting in the area of one side of the casing.  In addition, other
objects, desirable features, and characteristics will become apparent from the subsequent summary and detailed description, and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background.
SUMMARY
 The at least one object, other objects, desirable features, and characteristics, are achieved by virtue of the fact that the hinged support can be pivoted around an axis mounted in the casing, and the support exhibits two support sections
interconnected so that they can pivot around an axis situated parallel to the casing axis, and the two support sections are folded toward each other when the support is moved from the first setting to the second setting.  Therefore, it possible to toggle
the support from its first setting to its second setting.
 In the first setting of the support, two support planes are formed in the casing for the at least one receptacle.  If the foldable support is in the first setting and latched, and the support is placed under the upper lower end of the opening of
the casing, an area for holding the at least one receptacle is formed in the casing above the support.  Another area for holding one or more additional objects is then created under the support.  By contrast, if the hinged support is in its second
setting, a holding area with a grater overall depth is created, thereby extending from the upper end of the opening in the casing to the floor of the casing.  In this case, the casing can accommodate a larger receptacle, viewed in its extension
perpendicular to the floor area of the casing.
 The toggling support sections preferably fold backward into their second setting relative to the orientation of the motor vehicle.  This movement of the support sections corresponds to the ergonomically convenient movement when the fixture
element is situated next to the vehicle passengers oriented in the traveling direction, in particular the driver.
 In particular, the pivoting hinge of the two support sections is designed in such a way that the two support sections abut each other flatly in the second setting of the section.  This enables a very space-saving accommodation of the support in
its second setting inside the casing.
 From the standpoint of an ergonomically convenient access to the casing, and hence the at least one receptacle accommodated by the casing, it is viewed as especially advantageous if the support section pivoted in the casing is swiveled by an
angle of up to about 120.degree.  in the second setting of the support relative to the position of this support section in the first setting of the support.  This slightly inclined position of the support section relative to the perpendicular in its
second setting makes it possible to reach into this area of the casing at a corresponding incline, making objects arranged inside the casing especially easy to get to.
 The pivoting axis of the two support sections in the second setting of the support is preferably spaced a greater distance away from the floor than in the first setting of the support.  Consequently, the two support sections are preferably
folded up from the flat position in the first setting of the support.  Hence, the support sections are situated closer to the casing opening in the second setting of the support, thereby making them especially easy to grasp when returning the support
back to the first setting.
 In particular to provide a structurally especially advantageous manufacturing process and minimize the plurality of parts, it is provided that the two support sections are essentially identical in design.
 To enable easy and reliable grasping of the support, one advantageous embodiment provides that at least one of the support sections exhibit a recess open toward the pivoting axis of the two support sections or toward the casing.  In the area
where the support can be folded, or in the area of the free end of the support, it therefore becomes possible to grasp and pivot one of the support sections, whether it is from the first setting to the second setting or from the second setting to the
first setting.
 According to an embodiment of the invention, the at least one receptacle is held by means of the at least one lateral clamping element.  In this regard, the casing exhibits an upper frame, in particular, one that can be clamped with the casing
section exhibiting the floor and walls of the casing.  The frame preferably exhibits the at least one lateral clamping, which in particular is elastic.  If the frame can be clamped with the casing section, the frame with the clamping element can be
removed from the casing section.  This type of use is indicated in cases where receptacles held by the casing need not be fixed in place. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit application and uses.  Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background and summary or the following
detailed description.
 Depicted is a section of a middle console 1 with a horizontally sliding roller blind 2 located above the fixture element 3 according to an embodiment of the invention mounted in the middle console 1.  The roller blind 2 covers the opening 4 of
the casing 5 of the fixture element 3 in the setting shown on FIG. 1; the roller blind 2 is not shown on FIG. 2 to FIG. 5.
 The fixture element 3 is designed as a module, and hence can be inserted into an opening in the middle console 1 depending on how the vehicle is outfitted.  The casing 5 of the fixture element 3 is box-shaped, with a front face wall 6 extending
substantially perpendicular to the floor 9 of the casing, a rear face wall 22 extending at an angle of roughly 110.degree.  relative to the floor 9, and also lateral walls 7 and 8 arranged perpendicular to the front face wall 6, which connect the two
face walls 6 and 22.
 A hinged support 23 is arranged inside the casing 5, and here formed by two lamellar support sections 10 and 11.  The support section 11 can be pivoted around an axis 24 situated in the rear lateral wall 22.  This axis 24 is arranged parallel to
the floor 9, and located slightly under half the height of the casing 5.  The end of the support section 11 facing away from the axis 24 is pivoted with the other support section 10 by means of another axis 25.  As opposed to the axis 24 arranged in the
upper area of the support section 11, the pivoting axis 25 is situated between the two support sections 10 and 11 in the lower area of the support sections 10 and 11 in relation to their extended arrangement corresponding to the first setting of the
support 23.  In this first, horizontal setting of the support 23 arranged parallel to the floor 9, the end area of the support section 10 facing away from the axis 25 abuts a stop 26 of the front face wall 6.  In this setting, the facing front surfaces
of the support sections 10 and 11 come into contact above the axis 25, so that this extended setting of the support 23 represents its lower end setting.
 The support 23 can be folded by toggling into the end setting also shown on FIG. 5 via the intermediate setting illustrated on FIG. 4.  In this end setting corresponding to the second setting of the support 23, the support section 11 abuts the
rear face wall 22, and the support section 10 is folded against the support section 11.  In this second setting, the axis 25 is positioned slightly below the roller blind 2.
 The support 23 can be folded especially easily if in particular the support section 10 exhibits a recess 27 open toward its free end, through which this support section 10 can be grasped and in particular moved from the first setting to the
second setting of the support 23.  The support 23 is moved from the second setting to the first setting either manually, or latching means are provided to fix the support 23 in its second setting, keeping the support 23 in this position pre-stressed by a
spring, wherein the support 23 is moved to its first setting by force of the spring during manual release of the latching mechanism.
 The casing 5 exhibits an upper frame 28, which can be clamped with the casing section that exhibits the floor 9 and walls 6, 7, 8 and 22 of the casing 5.  The frame 28 accommodates several lateral clamping elements 29, which extend parallel to
the floor 9, and project into the clear space of the frame 28.  These clamping elements 29 are lip-shaped and elastic.  As a consequence, these clamping elements 29 can reliably hold one or more receptacles in the fixture element 3.
 While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing summary and detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist.  It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or
exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration in any way.  Rather, the foregoing summary and detailed description will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for
implementing an exemplary embodiment, it being understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements described in an exemplary embodiment without departing from the scope as set forth in the appended claims and their
legal equivalents.

 The present invention relates generally to collapsible and portable ice houses.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Ice fishing is a popular winter past time in northern climates.  Ice fishing is the activity of catching fish through an opening in the ice on a frozen body of water such as a lake, river, or pond.  Ice houses, also known as ice shanties in some
locations, are small shelters that are used to protect an ice angler from the elements including wind and blowing snow.  Typically, an ice house includes room for one to six anglers and their gear.  Some ice houses are more permanent structures, and are
towed to their location using a vehicle such as a truck or four-wheeler.  Other ice shelters are portable and can be easily moved by the anglers themselves and quickly set-up at different locations.  Various ice house structures mounted on sleds are
disclosed in U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,239,247, 6,397,870 and U.S.  Patent Publication No. US2006/0238005, which are hereby incorporated by reference.
 In order to quickly assemble and take-down the frame of a portable ice house, the ice angler must typically remove their gloves to improve dexterity and to avoid getting pieces of their gloves caught in the frame assembly.  Even with gloves
removed anglers often find it difficult to operate latch mechanisms that are coated with ice and snow or frozen.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention is directed to an ice house with a collapsible frame assembly that facilitates quick set-up and take-down, without the need for the ice angler to remove their winter protective gear.  The frame members are telescopically
engaged to facilitate quick assembly and disassembly.  The connecting end of the frame members are connected by a plunger assembly housed in an actuator assembly.  The actuator assembly protects the plunger assembly from the elements and facilitates
operation with gloved hands.  The frame assembly can be secured to a sled or free-standing.  According to another embodiment, the ice house can also include a seat assembly secured to the frame assembly and a cover including at least one door provided
over the frame assembly.
 In one embodiment, the ice house includes collapsible frame assembly including at least one first pole with a connecting end having a plunger assembly.  At least one second pole has a hollow end sized to telescopically engage with the plunger
assembly and the first pole.  The second pole has at least one detent proximate a connecting end sized to releasably engage with a plunger on the plunger assembly.  The actuator assembly includes a first end secured to the connecting end of the second
pole and a second end adapted to telescopically receive the plunger assembly and the first pole.  The actuator assembly includes an actuator located over the detent and configured to flex between a relaxed position and a depressed position that
disengages the plunger from the detent.  A seat assembly is secured to the frame assembly and a cover having at least one door is attached to the frame assembly.
 The actuator assembly preferably shields the plunger assembly from ice and snow.  The actuator can be connected to the actuator assembly by a living hinge, a mechanical hinge, a flexible web, or a variety of other mechanisms.  In one embodiment,
the actuator includes a protrusion opposite the detent that depresses the plunger into the hollow end of the second pole.  A distal end of the actuator is preferably located over the detent so that a force applied to an external surface of the actuator
is concentrated on the plunger.  An external surface on the actuator is preferably at least 10 times larger than a surface area of a distal end of the plunger.  A raised feature aligned with the plunger is preferably provided on an external surface of
the actuator.
 In one embodiment the plunger assembly includes a housing having a diameter sized to fit in a hollow end of the first pole and a spring located in a recess in the housing that is configured to bias the plunger through a hole in the connecting
end of the first pole.  In another embodiment, the plunger assembly includes an alignment member extending beyond the connecting end and sized to fit in the hollow end of the second pole.  The actuator assembly permits one handed operation of the plunger
assembly.
 The present invention is also directed to an actuator assembly for an ice house having a collapsible frame assembly with a plurality of first and second poles.  The actuator assembly includes a plunger assembly attached to a connecting end of at
least one first pole.  The plunger assembly includes at least one plunger protruding through a hole in the connecting end of the first pole.  The actuator assembly includes a first end secured to a connecting end of at least one second pole.  A second
end of the actuator assembly is adapted to telescopically receive the plunger assembly and the first pole.  The actuator assembly includes an actuator located over a detent in the second pole sized to receive the plunger.  The actuator is configured to
flex between a relaxed position and a depressed position that disengages a plunger from the detent.
 The present invention is also directed to a method of disassembling telescopically engaged first and second poles of a collapsible frame assembly for an ice house.  The method includes the steps of grasping an actuator assembly attached to the
second pole.  The actuator assembly overlaps a plunger assembly attached to the first pole.  The plunger assembly includes a plunger that extends from the first pole through a detent on the second pole.  The actuator assembly shields the plunger assembly
from ice and snow.  The actuator on an actuator assembly that is aligned with a plunger in the plunger assembly is depressed a sufficient amount to disengage the plunger from the detent on the second pole.  The first pole is then slide relative to the
second pole.  The first and second poles can remain telescopically engaged or can separate. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING

 In some embodiments, the cover 15 may also include one or more outer pockets (not shown) for displaying a fishing license or other appropriate permit.
 FIG. 3A is a perspective view of a collapsible frame assembly 20 according to an embodiment of the present invention.  FIG. 3B illustrates an exploded view of the collapsible frame assembly 20 mounted on sled 48.
 As shown in FIG. 3A, a seat assembly 25 is secured to the frame assembly 20.  In one embodiment, the seat assembly 25 is a folding seat assembly.  As shown in FIG. 3B, the frame assembly 20 and seat assembly 25 can be secured to a sled 48 using
a plurality of fasteners known to those of skill in the art.  The sled 48 provides a supportive base for the seat assembly 25, and can be used for transporting the ice house 10 from one location to another.  In some embodiments, the sled 48 may include
at least one pair of runners (not shown).  The runners may be added to the sled 48 after manufacture using a kit.
 As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the frame includes a pair of canopy brackets 52 secured to either side of the sled 48 via a pair of mounting brackets 54.  According to one embodiment, three pairs of straight poles 56 are rotatable with respect to
canopy brackets 52 located on either side of the sled 48 such that the straight poles 56 are able to rotate to a raised configuration.  Additionally, a pair of bent poles 58 is coupled to a lower, front portion 60 of each of the canopy brackets 52.  Each
of the bent poles 58 includes a bent portion 62 and a straight portion 64.  In one embodiment, the straight portions 64 of each of the bent poles 58 are configured to lie flat on the surface where the ice house 10 is being erected
 The frame assembly 20 also includes a plurality of cross-brace poles 66 adapted to couple to the each pair of straight poles 56 and an additional front cross-brace pole 68 adapted to couple to the straight portions 64 of each of the bent poles
58.  Additionally, as shown FIG. 3A and 3B, the frame assembly 20 includes a pair of front spreader poles 72, at least two roof spreader poles 74, and a rear spreader pole 76.  The length of spreader poles 72 and/or 76 may be adjustable.  Each of the
spreader poles 72, 76 is adapted to be coupled to the appropriate cross-brace pole 66, 68.
 The poles 56, 58, 66 and/or 68 can be made of metal such as aluminum, aluminum alloys, titanium and titanium alloys, and other suitable materials known in the art.  Additionally, the poles 56, 58, 66, and 68 can have any suitable cross-sectional
configuration to provide strength and minimal weight.  For example, the poles can have a circular, square, diamond, or a hexagonal cross-section.  According to one embodiment, the poles 56, 58, 66, and 68 have a circular cross-section.
 According to various embodiments, the straight poles 56 and the straight portions 64 of the bent poles 58 have a smaller diameter than the cross-brace poles 66 and 68.  The straight poles 56 and the straight portions 64 are configured to be
inserted or to telescope into the larger diameter cross-brace poles 66 and/or 68.  FIG. 3C is an exploded view of the collapsible seat assembly 25 shown in FIG. 3A.  The seat assembly is intended to be mounted to the mounting brackets 54.
 According to various embodiments of the present invention, actuator assembly 80 are preferably located at one of the connecting ends 78 to facilitate engagement of the poles 56, 58, 66, 68.  FIG. 4A through 4D illustrate various views of an
actuator assembly 80.  The actuator assembly 80 are preferably secured to the connecting ends 78 of the larger diameter cross-brace poles 66 and/or 68 using a variety of techniques, such as for example by mechanical fasteners, adhesives, and the like.
 The actuator assembly 80 includes a tubular member or sleeve 82 having a first end 84, a second end 86, and an upper portion 88.  An actuator 90 is attached to the sleeve 82 at upper portion 88.  Fastener 92 (e.g., screw) is provided for
securing the clip 80 to the connecting end 78 of the poles 66, 68.
 As best illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B, the larger diameter poles 66, 68 include detent 70 and fastener hole 71.  The detent 70 is preferably sized and shaped to receive plunger 98.  In the illustrated embodiment, the detent 70 is a hole in the
sidewall of the poles 66, 68.  The fastener 92 engages with fastener hole 71 to attach the actuator assembly 80 to the larger diameter poles 66, 68.
 Plunger assembly 106 is attached to connecting end 78 of smaller diameter poles 56, 58 with fastener 108.  The plunger assembly 106 includes housing 120 with a recess 122 that retains spring 96 and the plunger 98 configured to releasably engage
with detent 70 in the larger diameter poles 66, 68.  Housing 120 also includes alignment member 104 extending past the connecting end 78.  The alignment member 104 is sized to engage with hollow end 73 of the poles 66, 68.  The alignment member 104 can
be a separate piece or may be integrally formed with the housing 120.
 In the illustrated embodiment, the plunger assembly 106 is attached to the connecting end 78 of the poles 56, 58 by depressing plunger 98 into recess 122.  The plunger assembly 106 is inserted into hollow end 124 in one of the poles 56, 58 until
the plunger 98 engages with hole 126 at connecting end 78.  Fastener 108 is then inserted though hole 128 into hole 130 in the housing 120.
 In operation, the alignment member 104 is inserted into the second end 86 of the actuator assembly 80.  Curved surface 100 at the second end 86 depresses the plunger 98 to permit further insertion into the actuator assembly 80 until the plunger
98 is aligned with the detent 70 in one of the poles 66, 68.  Once aligned, the spring 96 automatically pushes the plunger 98 into engagement with the detent 70, mechanically locking one of the poles 56, 58 to one of the poles 66, 68.
 In the mechanically locked position illustrated in FIG. 5B, the actuator 90 is aligned with the plunger 98.  The actuator 90 is configured to flex in region 102 between a relaxed position and a depressed position within the tubular member 82. 
The actuator 90 can be coupled to the actuator assembly 80 via one or more mechanical hinges.  In another embodiment, the actuator 90 is integrally formed with the actuator assembly 80 so that the region 102 comprises a living hinge or a flexible web. 
The region 102 is preferably located offset from the plunger 98 so that any force applied to external surface 110 of the actuator 90 is concentrated on the plunger 98.
 External surface 110 of the actuator 90 includes raised portion 94 that facilitates operation with the user's thumb or one or two fingers on a single hand.  The raised portion 94 serves as a guide for pressing on the actuator 90 and focuses the
compressive force F on the spring loaded button plunger 98.  The raise portion 94 is preferably located directly over the plunger 98 to concentrate the force F at that location.  The external surface 110 has a surface area at least 10 times the surface
area of a distal end of the plunger 98, facilitating operation while wearing gloves.
 Protrusion 112 on the actuator 90 is positioned over the plunger 98.  The protrusions 112 preferably has a diameter less than the diameter of detent 70 in the poles 66, 68.  Consequently, force F advances the protrusion 112 into the detent 70
and depresses the plunger 98 below the hollow end 73 of the poles 66, 68, permitting the poles 56, 58 to slide telescopically within the poles 66, 68 and/or be disengaged from the actuator assembly 80.
 Quick assembly and take-down of the frame assembly 20 minimizes an ice angler's prolonged exposure to the weather elements and maximizes the amount of time for fishing.  The actuator assembly 80 permits an ice angler wearing gloves or other
winter protective gear to operate the plunger 98, avoiding the potential of an ice angler's bare fingers getting stuck to the pole or pinched between the hole and the spring loaded button.  The actuator assembly 80 also protects the plunger assembly 106
from the elements, minimizing the risk of the plunger 98 freezing in the locked position.

A seal for retaining liquid between two relatively rotatable members of which one member carries the seal and the other member has a cylindrical surface engaged by the seal,
comprising a sealing ring having a static sealing portion carried by said one member and spaced from the said surface of the said other member, a flexible flange extending from the static sealing portion, generally in the direction in which the said
surface of said other member extends and towards the liquid to be sealed, to an outer end portion of the sealing ring, two mutually-inclined surfaces on said outer end portion defining a circular sealing lip, and a plurality of circumferentiallyspaced
projections raised on that inclined surface which is the closer of the two inclined surfaces to the static sealing portion and which is remote from the liquid, each projection having a surface which is generated by movement, about the central axis of the
ring, of a line which, when the seal is carried by the first said member and is in its free state prior to assembly of the said other member, is substantially parallel to the operative direction of the said surface of said other member and which, at one
position, is contiguous with the sealing lip and which, on opposite sides of said one position, recedes from the sealing lip in a direction toward said static sealing portion so that when said seal is in said free state said surface of said projection
lies entirely at the same radial distance as the sealing lip or on the same side of said sealing lip as said static sealing portion, said surface of said projection having a substantial width at said one position, the sealing lip and the portion of the
said surface of each projection which is contiguous with the sealing lip engaging the said surface of the said other member with an interference fit, whereby upon assembly of the sealing ring between said members, the flange is deflected from its free
state, about the static sealing portion, the part of the surface of each projection in the vicinity of that part which is contiguous with the lip consequently engaging the said surface of the said other member over an area having opposite sides which
extend away from the sealing lip and which diverge away from each other and with a pressure which increases as the distance from the sealing lip in a direction at right angles to the plane of the sealing lip increases.
2.  A seal according to claim 1, wherein the said surface of each projection at the side of said one position not only recedes from the sealing lip but merges circumferentially into the corresponding surface of the adjacent projection.
3.  A seal according to claim 1, wherein the said surface of each projection is convex in a direction radially inwardly of said sealing lip adjacent and on both sides of one position.
4.  A seal as claimed in claim 1, in which said sealing lip is on the radially innermost part of the seal.
5.  A seal as claimed in claim 1, in which said sealing lip is on the radially outermost part of the seal.  ",,"This invention relates to a seal for use between two relatively-rotating
surfaces, for preventing the leakage of fluid therebetween.  One such seal is a rotary shaft seal.
It is well known to provide helical grooves or threads adjacent the sealing lip of a rotary shaft seal in order to provide sealing of fluid under dynamic conditions.  These have been found to operate reasonably well when the direction of rotation
is in one direction only, but have the serious disadvantage of providing a leakage path for the fluid when the direction of rotation is reversed.
It is an object of this invention to provide a seal for use between two relatively-rotating surfaces which not only has a more effective sealing function but also has such sealing function irrespective of the direction of relative rotation.
The invention provides a lip seal for fluids, for use between two relatively-rotatable surfaces, having a surface-engageable sealing lip portion and projections spaced at intervals around the sealing lip portion on the side thereof intended, in
use, to be remote from the fluid to be sealed, each projection being adapted to engage the surface engageable by the sealing lip portion with a contact area of which two opposite sides extend away from the lip portion and diverge away from each other so
that each side is inclined at an acute angle to the part of the sealing lip portion adjacent thereto.  When assembled between two relatively-rotating parts, the force under the projection increases as the axial distance from the sealing lip portion
increases. In the accompanying drawings
FIG. 1 is a view, partly in section, of a rotary shaft seal, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, mounted in sealing relationship with the shaft of an automobile gear box.
FIG. 2 is a perspective view of part of the rotary shaft seal shown in FIG. 1,
FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 show the cross section of the sealing ring in radial planes containing the lines 3--3, 4--4 and 5--5 respectively, of FIG. 2,
FIG. 6 is a developed view of the contact area of the seal with the shaft,
FIG. 7 is a sectional view of part of another rotary shaft seal in accordance with an embodiment of the invention,
FIG. 8 is a sectional view of part of an axial face seal, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, and
FIG. 9 is a sectional view of part of another axial face seal, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Referring to FIGS. 1 to 5 of the drawings, the rotary shaft seal 1 is mounted in a housing 2 formed at one end of a gear box
casing 3.  A shaft 4 projects from the gear box casing and has a suitable means 5 for connecting it to a device to be driven by the shaft.  The shaft 4 is supported in the gear box casing by a bearing 6.  The seal 1 seals the space between the shaft and
that wall of the housing which is parallel to the axis of the shaft, so as to prevent leakage of liquid from the gear box to the exterior thereof.
Referring more particularly to FIGS. 2 to 5, the seal 1, which is described merely to show one example of a seal in accordance with the invention is of generally annular construction, is conveniently moulded to shape, and is made from any
suitable sealing material such as rubber or a rubber-like material.  It comprises a static sealing portion formed as an outer holding annulus 7 which is stiffened by an inserted metal ring 8, and an inner flexible flange 9.  A garter spring 10 embraces
the flange 9.
The inner flexible flange 9 has an outer end portion formed with two surfaces 11 and 12 each of which is inclined at an angle to the axis of the seal so as to meet the other and define a sealing lip 13.
As can be seen in FIG. 1, the surface 11 lies in use, adjacent to the liquid to be sealed.  The surface 11 is, therefore, on the ""oil"" side of the seal and the surface 12 is, therefore, on the ""air"" side of the seal.
Surface 12 has thereon and spaced therearound a plurality of projecting parts which join together to form an integral projection 14 with an undulating side wall 15.  This side wall 15 is substantially parallel to the axis of the seal in its free
state as moulded and the distance of this side wall 15 from the axis of the seal varies cyclically around the surface 12 having its minimum distance equal to the radius of the lip 13.  As seen in FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 the axial length of the side wall 15
varies from a maximum at the lip 13 to a minimum (which may be zero) at its points most remote from the lip 13.
When the seal is fitted in a housing and engages with a shaft, as shown in FIG. 1, the engagement with the shaft will be an interference fit.  The contact area of the sealing lip portion 13 with the shaft will be thin and continuous, and the
contact area of the projection 14 with the shaft will be a number of spaced-apart contact areas 15' (see FIG. 6).  Each such contact area 15' has two opposite sides 15"" which extend away from the lip portion and diverge away from each other.  Thus each
of the opposite sides 15"" is inclined at an acute angle to the part of the sealing lip portion which is adjacent thereto.  Under static conditions, the force under the projection on the shaft increases as the distance from the sealing lip portion, at
right angles thereto, increases, substantially up to the outer edge of the contact area.
In operation, any fluid which leaks past the lip to the air side thereof will be carried around by the rotating shaft.  When it approaches one side 15"" of the contact area of the projection, the liquid by reason of the shape of the contact area,
will be moved towards the seal lip, building up as a wedge-shaped pocket of liquid.  Due to the rotation of the shaft, pressure will be developed in the wedge-shaped pocket of liquid.  This pressure will overcome the contact pressure between the lip 13
and the part of the projection adjacent the lip 13 on the one hand, and the shaft 4 on the other hand.  However, the force under the projection increases as the axial distance from the lip 13 increases and thus the leakage liquid will undergo a dynamic
pumping action and will tend to be forced back under the lip to the oil side thereof.  The formation of the wedge-shaped pocket is aided by the side wall 15 which converges towards the surface of the shaft in the region of the side of the contact area. 
Any residual film of liquid not forced back under the lip 13, will be carried round by the shaft to the next wedge-shaped pocket.
This dynamic pumping effect will be obtained irrespective of the direction of rotation of a shaft because of the two opposite diverging sides 15"" of the surface contact area 15' of the projection with a shaft.  Furthermore, efficient sealing will
be provided even when the shaft is stationary because the engagement of the sealing lip portion with the shaft is continous.
In use of the shaft seal just described with reference to the drawings, there will be a continuous circulation of liquid under the sealing lip portion and under a substantial part of each projection in contact with the shaft.  This circulation of
liquid will not only tend to act as a lubricant and prevent undue wear of the sealing lip portion and a part of the projection, but will also tend to act to cool the sealing lip portion and the projection.
The seal shown in FIGS. 1 to 6 has a lip which engages a rotating surface during operation, and the sealing lip is located internally of the seal.  FIG. 7 shows a seal which rotates with a shaft 16 during operation.
The seal comprises an inner holding annulus 17 which is stiffened by an inserted metal ring 18 and an outer flexible flange 19.  An endless spring 20 under compression is associated with the flange 19.  The outer flexible flange 19 has two
surfaces 21 and 22, each of which are inclined at an angle to the axis of the seal so as to meet and define a sealing lip 23.
The surface 22 has thereon an integral projection 24, with a side wall 25, which is similar to the projection 14 shown in FIGS. 2 to 5, except that the distance of the side wall 25 from the axis of the seal is at a maximum at the lip 23.
The sealing lip 23 and the projection 14 are circumferentially compressed upon assembly within the stationary housing surface 26.
The operation of the seal is the same as that described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 6.
In FIG. 8 there is shown an axial face seal in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.
This axial face seal 27 of FIG. 8 has a holding annulus 28 which fits on a rotatable shaft 29, and a flexible flange 30.  The annulus 28 is stiffened by two cup-shaped washer-like pressings 31, 32 between which is held a spring member 33.  The
cup-shaped pressing 31 is an interference fit on the annulus 28 and the cup-shaped pressing 32 is an interferencee fit on the spring member 33.  The spring member 33 urges the flange 30 against a static surface 34 of a housing.
The outer end portion of the flexible flange 30 has two surfaces 35 and 36 which are inclined at an angle to each other and meet to form a sealing lip 37.  The surface 36 has an integral projection 38 which is similar to the projections 14 and 24
of the two previously-described embodiments.  Thus, when the sealing ring is in its free state as moulded, the generating surface of each projection is substantially parallel to the static surface 34 and transverse to the central axis of the shaft.
FIG. 9 shows an axial face seal in accordance with another embodiment of the invention.  This axial face seal 39 has a holding annulus 40 which fits on the surface 41 of a stationary housing 42.  The annulus 40 is stiffened by two cup-shaped
washer-like pressings 43, 44, between which is held a spring member 45.  The cup-shaped pressing 43 is an interference fit on the surface 41 and the cup-shaped pressing 44 is an interference fit on the spring member 45.  The spring-member 45 urges the
flange 46 against a surface of a rotatable member 47.
The outer end portion of the flexible flange 46 has two surfaces 48 and 49 which are inclined at an angle to each other and meet to form a sealing lip 50.  The surface 48 has an integral projection 51 which is similar to the projections 14, 24
and 38 of the three previously-described embodiments and which is arranged to provide a contact area in a manner similar to that previously described.
In the embodiments of the invention described with reference to the drawings, each contact area 15 is formed by simple continuous projection on the inclined surface 12.  Such a continuous projection is not essential.  A number of spaced-apart
discrete projections, each providing one or more contact areas, similar to a contact area 15, could be formed integrally on the inclined surface which in use of the seal is remote from the fluid to be sealed.
Lip seals for fluids in accordance with this invention may readily be designed to give an optimum or required pumping action by suitable choice of the length (in a direction at right angles to the sealing lip portion) of the contact surface of
the projection with a shaft or other member and/or by suitable choice of the wedge angles.
With a lip seal for fluids in accordance with this invention intended for use as a shaft seal a greater degree of lack of concentricity between the shaft axis and the housing axis can be tolerated than heretofor.
A seal in accordance with the invention can be split into two or more parts which abut against each other to form the seal.

 This invention relates to golf cart canopies, more specifically, a vertically attached golf cart canopy having a folding canopy which allows other accessories, such as coolers and sand bottles, to be mounted underneath the device.
 The use of golf carts has become commonplace in the game of golf.  Golf carts have not only permitted golfers to get to the next hole quicker, but have also allowed golfers to bring along more items to the course to make the game more enjoyable,
such as more clubs, tees, golfballs, beverages, sand bottles and the like.  The golfers simply place the items in the back of the golf cart and drive the cart from hole to hole, enjoying the game of golf.
 However, a perfect golfing day can quickly change into an imperfect day when inclement weather occurs.  Although most golf carts have roofs which provide some shelter from rain for the players, all of the items in the back of the golf car are
susceptible to being rained upon.  The rain could not only damage the items in the back of the cart, but it could also ruin them altogether as well.  This is especially unfortunate when the items ruined includes expensive golf clubs.
 However, in order to protect these items, vertically attachable golf cart canopies have been created.  Currently, there many vertically attachable golf cart canopies in use.  However, major disadvantages to using the current canopies is that
they either must be attached to the golf cart roof, are difficult to use or impede the amount of storage space beneath the cover.  In addition, many of the currently used canopies require some sort of modification or alteration to the golf cart in order
to secure the cover device to it.  Not only is this difficult, but it could also affect the aesthetic appearance of the golf cart.
 Thus, the need for a vertically attachable golf cart canopy which has an easy to use folding canopy which allows other accessories to be mounted underneath the cover and does not require modification to the golf cart is needed.
 The relevant prior art includes the following patents:

 Although the above patents teach various types of vertically attachable golf cart canopies, none teach a vertically attachable golf cart canopy designed to have a folding canopy which allows other accessories, such as coolers and sand bottles,
to be mounted underneath the cover.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The primary object of the present invention is to provide a vertically attached golf cart canopy that has a folding canopy.
 A further object of the present invention is to provide a vertically attached golf cart canopy that allows other accessories, such as coolers and sand bottles, to be mounted underneath the cover.
 An even further object of the present invention is to provide a vertically attached golf cart canopy that is easy to use.
 A further object of the present invention is to provide a vertically attached golf cart canopy that is durable.
 An even further object of the present invention is to provide a vertically attached golf cart canopy that is easy to attach to a golf cart.
 A further object of the present invention is to provide a vertically attached golf cart canopy that can be attached to a golf cart without altering or modifying the golf cart.
 The present invention fulfills the above and other objects by providing a vertically attached golf cart canopy having three components: a securing frame, canopy support bars and a canopy.  The securing frame is shaped so as to have two vertical
legs and a horizontal top bar.  Securing tabs are located on the securing frame so as to secure the vertically attached golf cart canopy to a golf cart bag holder.  Tabs are located at a predetermined location on the legs wherein the support bars are
pivotally attached to the securing frame.  The securing frame and canopy support bars are made of a rigid and durable material, preferably steel, so as to withstand rain and other outdoor elements, such as wind and hail, without affecting the structure
of the securing frame and bars.  The top of the securing frame has a canopy holder which holds the canopy to the securing frame.  The canopy, preferably made of a waterproof material, is attached to the canopy support bars and is removably attached to
the legs of the securing frame by using fastening means, preferably hook and loop type fastening material.  The canopy holder also contains a canopy flap and a canopy fastener to allow the user to keep the vertically attachable golf cart canopy in an
upright position.
 To use the present invention, the user first takes the securing frame and positions the securing tabs on the golf bag support bar so the legs of the securing frame are located beneath the roof of a golf cart.  The user then inserts a long bolt
into the holes located on the securing tabs and uses threaded nuts and bolts to secure the securing frame onto the golf bag support bar.  The user then takes the sides of the canopy and fastens each side to the securing frame by using a fastening means,
such as hook and loop type fastening material.  When the user desires the canopy to be down, he or she simply grabs the bottom canopy support bar and pulls downward.  To raise the canopy, the user simply pushes the bottom canopy support bar upwards.  In
addition, the user can keep the canopy in an upright position by using the canopy flap and canopy fasteners.  The flap has a fastening means, preferably snaps, while the canopy fasteners have the corresponding fastening means.  While the canopy support
bars are in the upright position, the user positions the canopy flap so it is extending away from the securing frame.  The user then takes the canopy fasteners and matches the fastening means on the fasteners to the fastening means on the flap.
 Because the frame is constructed so as to freely stand parallel to the cart support bar, no modifications to the golf cart are necessary for the installation of the present invention.  However, an optional bracket located on the securing frame
may also be used to maintain the vertically attached golf cart canopy in an upright position.
 In addition, because the pivoting point of the canopy support bars are located at a distance above attachment area, more room is available in the golf cart storage area for other items, such as coolers and/or sand bottles, to be mounted.
 The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention should become even more readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings wherein
there is shown and described illustrative embodiments of the invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

rear canopy 5 and side canopy 16, although only the side canopy 16 is shown.
 In FIG. 9, a perspective view of the present invention secured to a golf cart is shown.  The golf cart has two golf cart support bars 17, a golf bag support bar 18 and a storage area 19.  The vertically attached golf cart canopy is designed so
as the legs 21 of the securing frame 1 are a predetermined distance away from the golf cart support bars 17 when the securing tabs 6 are secured to the golf support bar 18.  Thus, there is no need to secure the vertically attached golf cart canopy to the
roof of the golf cart or, in fact, make any alterations to the golf cart.
 Finally, with reference to FIG. 10, a side view of the present invention secured to a golf cart is shown.  When the present invention is installed on a golf cart, the canopy holder 11 is located under the golf cart roof and legs 21 are a
predetermined distance away from the golf cart support bars 17, thus, making it difficult for rainwater to enter the storage area 19.  The securing tabs 6 secure to the golf bag support bar 18 by using bolts 7.  The optional bracket 22, which is
preferably L-shaped and extends away from the securing frame 1, may also be used to assist in maintaining the vertically attached golf cart canopy in an upright position by positioning a roof extension 25 which hangs from the golf cart roof between the
securing frame 1 and the bracket.
 The use of the present invention will allow users to mount other accessories, such as coolers and sand bottles, beneath a canopy cover which acts as a protective cover from wind, rain, sun and other elements of nature.
 It is to be understood that while a certain form of the invention is illustrated, it is not to be limited to the specific form or arrangement of parts herein described and shown.  It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various
changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention and the invention is not be considered limited to what is shown and described in the specification and drawings.

2005, the entire content of each application is incorporated herein by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The invention relates to a convertible vehicle having a movable roof provided with a cover and having a sun roof part.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 It is known to provide a sun roof part in a convertible soft top which can be raised when the top is closed.  The total size of such a sun roof part must, however, be disposed within a roof region which does not fold when the top opens and the
soft cover folds.  The area available for the sun roof part is therefore small.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention provides a convertible with a sun roof part that may extend close to the front edge so that its area is increased.
 The front edge of the sun roof part may form a part of the front edge of the convertible roof and thus extend its area completely to the front.
 The front edge region of the sunroof part may be supported from beneath by a front crossmember of the frame part which is lower than the side and rear members of the frame part.  The frame part is preferably one piece for simple manufacturing
and for optimized roof stability.  Since the crossmember is lowered, a large amount of light is admitted.  In addition, the sunroof looks continuous from the outside since the crossmember may be completely covered by the sun roof part.
 The sun roof surface may be maximized when it directly adjoins the windshield when the roof is closed.  It is not bounded by any upper transverse frame part visible from the outside.  The windshield then visually merges uniformly into the sun
roof part.
 Portions of the roof to the sides of the recess may include a cover that extends up to the front edge of the roof and integrates visually with the rest of the covered roof.  The side and rear members of the frame part ma be configured as water
channels for sealing.
 The sunroof part may have a light-sensitive glass tint.  Alternatively, a blind or a similar shading unit can be associated with the sun roof part.  The blind may also be closable automatically when the roof is opened in order to prevent a view
of the roof parts disposed under the opened roof when the front portion of the roof remains facing upwardly in the original orientation.
 The sun roof part may be formed of polycarbonate for good break resistance at low weight. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 A convertible vehicle 1 is shown schematically in FIG. 1.  The vehicle includes a movable roof 2 which can be stowed in the rearward body region when the roof is open.  The roof 2 can be configured differently than shown and may include
generally rigid roof parts.  In each embodiment, when the roof is closed a front region faces a windshield frame 4 with a windshield 9 disposed therein.  The roof includes a cover 3 which is at least partly supported by a rigid assembly 5 disposed under
the cover 3.  The assembly 5 forms a frame part for a sun roof part 6 and the sunroof part 6 can be raised out of the plane of the roof cover 3.
 The roof 2 shown in the drawing has a relatively long design.  This design is not compulsory, but is suitable, for example, to cover the passenger compartment of a station wagon, a van or a SVU having two or more rows of seats behind one another
and to cover back to a trunk or a hatchback of the vehicle.
 To permit the sunroof part 6 to be embedded into the outer surface of the roof cover 3, a U-shaped recess is provided in the roof cover 3.  The U-shaped recess is open to the front, with respect to the direction of vehicle travel F. In the
illustrated embodiment, the cover 3 has two lateral, narrow longitudinal side regions 7 without a front transverse connection.  These longitudinal side regions 7 of the cover 3 extend up to the front roof edge.  The longitudinal side regions 7 of the
cover 3 are engaged from behind over most of their surface so that these regions are not tensioned in a freely movable manner.
 The front edge 8 of the sun roof part 6 itself forms the outer front roof edge in the center transverse region.  The sun roof part 6 therefore directly adjoins the windshield 9 when the roof is closed.  As shown in FIG. 2, this provides a
uniform appearance of the sun roof part 6 and windshield 9 so that they look continuous.  Preferably, the width of the windshield 9 and the sun roof part 6 is the same so that there is no step at the sides.  The covered longitudinal side regions 7 are
therefore correspondingly narrow.  Nor does the windshield frame 4 have to have any transverse frame part--or none which is visible from the outside--at its upper edge.  The windshield 9 then appears visually continuous with the movable sun roof part 6.
 The assembly 5 supporting the sun roof part 6 can be manufactured simply, in one piece and, for example, as a cast light metal part.  The assembly 5 includes a frame part 10 disposed under the sun roof part that extends to the sides and rear of
the sun roof part.  The frame part has a generally U-shaped cross section so as to provide a water channel.  The frame part 10 may include a front crossmember 12, which is lower than the side and rear members of the frame part 10.  The front cross member
12 forms a closed contour to increase the stability of the frame part.  The front cross member also provides a support surface for front pivot holders 11 for the sun roof part 6.  This front crossmember 12 can be covered by the sun roof part 6 since it
is lower than the other portions of the frame part.  Therefore, the front cross member is not visible from the outside if the sun roof part 6 is tinted.
 Front pivot holders 11 for the sun roof part may not be needed if the lateral lifting mechanisms are sufficiently stable, in particular in the front region, or additional holders are provided in the lateral region.
 Respective lifting mechanisms for the sun roof part 6 are arranged in the lateral sections of the frame part 10 so that the rear edge of said sun roof part can be moved upwardly, as shown in FIG. 6.  The cover 3 also extends deep into the
channels of the frame part 10.  As can be seen in section through the longitudinal side region 7 of the cover 3 (FIG. 4), the cover is held in place by a clamping rail 14 disposed at the bottom of the water channel.  The relationships are similar in the
rear section of the frame part 10.  FIG. 5 provides a cross section at the transverse center of the vehicle.
 Though not shown, the lifting mechanism may include displacement devices to move the sun roof part rearwardly.  The sun roof part 6 would then also become a sliding roof.  The displacement devices may include sections which are mutually
displaceable telescopically and can therefore be accommodated in a short and space-saving manner in the lateral water channels of the frame part 10 when they are retracted.
 The crossmember 12 described above can also serve in a dual function to receive a blind 15 or a similar shading unit.  In embodiments not including the cross member 12, another crossmember can be provided to receive a blind or shade.  In the
illustrated embodiment, the blind 15 is disposed somewhat behind the crossmember 12 and can be pulled out to the rear, which is opposite to the direction of travel F. The movement of the blind can take place manually or via an electric drive, for
example.
 The blind 15 is preferably automatically moved when the roof is opened such that it is disposed under the sun roof part 6.  Therefore, a view through the sunroof to parts of the roof located below it and/or to the roof mechanisms is blocked, as
shown in FIG. 10.
 The sun roof part 6 itself can be one piece or have a multipart design, and may be formed partially or entirely of a light and break-resistant material, for instance polycarbonate.
 The invention has been described in an illustrative manner.  It is, therefore, to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation.  Many modifications and variations of
the invention are possible in light of the above teachings.  Thus, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced other than as specifically described.

",,"This invention relates to automotive vehicle tilt cab latching devices.  It is desirable in automotive vehicles particularly commercial vehicles to provide as great a load carrying space on the
vehicle as possible without rendering servicing of the vehicle unduly difficult or expensive in time or rendering difficult the access to parts such as the engine or steering gear.  One way of achieving these ends is to provide the vehicle with a tilt
cab, that is, one which can be raised about a hinge axis at the front of the vehicle to permit easy access to the engine and other mechanism normally shrouded by the cab when it is in the down position on the vehicle frame, as it would be for normal use. With such a tilt cab arrangement it is essential to provide a latching device to ensure that the cab will not unlatch and tilt forward.
In an automotive vehicle cab latching device according to the invention a portion of a member of the tilt cab is adapted to be engaged with a portion of a frame member of the vehicle and clamped thereto by means of an over-centre or toggle clamp
comprising a pivot bar pivotally mounted in a latch housing secured on one of said members and pivotally movable therein by means of a lever fixed on one end of said bar, and an over-centre link fixed at one end on said bar and connected at its other end
by a link pin to one end of a hook of greater length than said over-centre link, said housing and a portion of said hook intermediate the ends of the hook being interconnected by a guide-pin and slot connection arranged so that angular movement of said
lever into a first predetermined position effects movement of the link and hook into a position in which the link is at an angle to a line joining said pivot bar and the point of engagement of said members, and a line joining the ends of the hook is at
an angle to said link, and movement of said lever from said first position towards a second position pivots said over-centre link and link pin from their first said positions into a slightly over-centre position relative to a line joining said pivot bar
axis and said point of engagement of said members and moves said hook angularly about said link pin relative to said over-centre link so that the free end of the hook is brought from a position disengaged from the other of said members into a position in
which it engages said other member and clamps it against the first member.
Preferably two such devices are provided, one on each side of the vehicle and a linkage interconnects the two devices so that operation of one device also operates the other.
The slot of the pin and slot connection may be curved along its length and the curvature at one end portion of the slot may be such that relative movement between said one end portion and said guide-pin results in a greater angular movement of
the hook than results from the relative movement of the remainder of the slot and the guide-pin.
The length of the guide-pin may be such as to permit of its flexing as the hook is moved to and from its first and second positions and by such flexing the guide-pin can accommodate the lengthwise displacement of the hook as it pivots about the
link pin and said other member. The appended claims define the scope of the monopoly claimed.  How the invention can be performed is hereinafter particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a device according to the invention;
FIG. 2 is a side view, to a smaller scale, showing the device of FIG. 1 assembled and indicating the disengaged position of its hook;
FIG. 3 is a view, similar to FIG. 2, with the hook in its engaged position; and
FIG. 4 is a view from the rear of the vehicle and looking forward to the front of the vehicle and showing two devices according to the invention located at the rear of the cab and connected to one another by a linkage. FIGS. 1 to 3 show
an automotive tilt cab latching device 1 according to the invention; the vehicle however is not shown in these Figures.  The device shown in these Figures has a cab member 2 adapted to be engaged with a frame member 4 of the vehicle and clamped thereto
by a toggle clamp 6.  The cab member comprises a channel-shaped plate 8 securable at its open edges to a resilient mounting 10 on the vehicle cab (not shown).  The channel plate 8 has an aperture 12 in one side through which can pass a hook 40 of the
device, as will be later described, and the closed base portion 14 of the channel plate is engageable in a complementary trough shaped portion 18 of a latch housing 16 fixed on, and constituting a portion of, the frame member 4 of the vehicle.  The latch
housing 16 conveniently is formed as a casting the general shape of which is that of a box in which said trough shaped portion is the upper wall, and in which one side wall adjacent the two end walls 20, 22 connected to said trough shaped portion is
omitted.  The base 24 of the housing is adapted to be secured on the frame member 4 of the vehicle in a position such that when the vehicle cab is in the down position bearing on the frame member, the closed base portion 14 of the cab member is received
in the trough portion 18 of the latch housing 16.  The cab member 2 is clamped to the frame member 4 by means of a toggle clamp 6 comprising a pivot bar 26 pivotally mounted in the side walls 20, 22 of the latch housing and pivotable by means of a lever
28 fixed on one end of the bar, and an over-centre link 30 fixed at one end 32 on said bar and connected at its other end 34 by a link pin 36 to one end 38 of a hook 40 of greater length than said over-centre link 30.  The hook 40 has a curved slot 42
intermediate its ends 38, 44 and a guide-pin 46 journalled in the side walls 20, 22 of the housing outboard of the pivot bar 26 extends through the slot 42 in the hook 40.  A domed adjuster bolt 48 is located in the other or free end 44 of the hook 40
and forms a curved end portion or the head of the hook.
The operation of the device 1 is as follows, it being assumed that the cab is in the down position resting on the vehicle frame 4 and the cab member 2 is engaged in the trough-like wall portion 18 of the latch housing 16.  The hook 40 at this
point is seen to be swung away from the cab member 2 (as shown in FIG. 2).  In this first predetermined position the link 30 and the hook 40 are in a position in which the link is at an angle to a line joining the pivot bar 26 and the point of engagement
of the members 2, 4 (for convenience this may be considered to be on the centre line of the base of the trough-like wall of the latch housing) and a line joining the ends 38, 44 of the hook 40 is at an angle to said link 30.  Movement of the lever 28
(clockwise as viewed in the drawing) from the first position towards a second position (shown in FIG. 3) pivots the over-centre link 30 and link pin 36 clockwise from their first said positions into a slightly over-centre position relative to a line
joining said pivot bar axis and said point of engagement of said members 2, 4 and the engagement of the slot 42 in the hook 40 with the guide-pin 46 moves said hook 40 anti-clockwise about said link pin 36 relative to said over-centre link 30 so that the
free end 44 of the hook is brought from its first position, disengaged from the cab member 2, into a second position in which it is engaged with the cab member 2 and clamps it against the latch housing 4, thereby securing the cab to the vehicle frame.
The slot 42 has a sharper curvature at its end portion 50 adjacent the link pin 36 than over the rest of its length so that movement of that end portion 50 about the guide-pin 46 results in a greater angular movement of the hook 40 for movement
of that length of the slot relative to the guide-pin than results from movement of the remainder of the slot relative to the pin.  The effect of this is to move the hook 40 rapidly into or out of engagement with the cab member 2 depending upon whether
the hook is being engaged or disengaged from the cab member.
The length of the guide-pin 46 (FIG. 1) is such that the pin can flex to accommodate the slight lengthwise movement of the hook 40 as it pivots about its over-centre position when being engaged or disengaged from the cab member 2.  In the
slightly over-centre position, the hook 40 is in tension between the point of engagement of its curved head 48 with the cab member 2 and the link pin 36, and the over-centre link 30 is in compression between the link pin 36 and the pivot bar 26.  Further
movement of the toggle clamp 6 is prevented by the guide-pin 46 abutting the end 52 of the slot 42.  Because of this over-centre position of the toggle clamp 6 any attempt to move the cab member 2 away from the frame member 4 without moving the toggle
clamp 6 out of its slightly over-centre position serves only to latch the two members 2, 4 more securely together.
The domed head bolt 48 at the contoured free end 44 of the hook can be adjusted to take up manufacturing tolerances and wear to ensure that there is no play between the hook and the cab member when the hook is in the engaged position. 
Additionally, as the hook is moved into or out of engagement with the cab member the domed head bolt rolls into or out of engagement with the cab member, thus minimizing wear of the contacting parts.  The guide slot 42 may be widened at its other end 52
remote from the over-centre link 30, to permit a slight change in the angular movement of the hook 40 so that the bolt 48 can pivot and ensure that its domed head rolls over the cab member 2 without straining the slot 42 against the pivot bar 26.
As shown in FIG. 4, two devices 1, 11 according to the invention are mounted on the vehicle, and in the Figure, a portion of the cab 56 is shown latched to the frame members 4.  These two devices are interconnected by a rigid link 54 so that
operation of one device also operates the other.  The guide-pin 46 and slot 42 connection ensures that in each device 1, 11 the hook 40 moves in a predetermined path thus ensuring that the two devices can be operated in unison.
The positions of the first or cab member 2 and the latch housing 16 could be reversed so that the first member 2 was secured to the frame 4 and the latch housing to the cab 56.
If desired, a stop member could be provided on the pivot bar 26 for movement into or out of engagement with a stop surface on the device 6 to ensure that with the pin slot connection only the design angular movement of the hook 40 will occur.
An automotive vehicle tilt cab latching device as described above provides a convenient and effective way of securing a vehicle tilt cab to the vehicle frame when the cab is in the down position and which restrains the cab from tilting during
normal use of the vehicle.
Additionally, when two devices are used they can be interconnected for operation from one side of the vehicle, which is a great convenience to the operator.

",,"FIELD OF INVENTION
This invention relates to enclosure structures for converting vehicles either into security or detention carriers or into a means of transportation wherein the driver or passengers or both are protected from persons outside the vehicle.
BACKGROUND
Prior to this invention, van-type vehicles have been specially manufactured to transport prisoners or to protect passengers against outsiders.  Frequently, however, such specially constructed vehicles are not available or readily obtainable or do
not have sufficient capacity to handle different situations such as the transportation of prisoners from a battle zone, the transportation of detained rioters from a disturbed area, or the transportation of armed service personnel or security personnel
(such as police) in dangerous areas.  Make-shift constructions to meet emergency conditions usually are inadequate to meet the needs arising from the types of situations mentioned above.  Furthermore, vans which are permanently and specially constructed
to meet security needs, are not versatile primarily because the security enclosure cannot be dissembled or removed.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION, OBJECTS AND DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
The present invention contemplates the provision of a novel modular security enclosure construction which fulfills the foregoing needs and which comprises a series of knockdown panels in the form of a conversion kit for easily and quickly
converting nonsecurity and unprotected type vehicles so that they can be used as security carriers to transport detained persons or to protect personnel being transported through dangerous or disturbed areas.
In one embodiment, the kit of this invention is constructed to convert an army-type truck having an open load or passenger-carrying bed and a partially enclosed driver's compartment.  The panels in the kit are detachably assembled on the truck to
define side, front, and rear walls and a roof for enclosing the passenger of load receiving space on the bed.  Additional protective panels are provided in the kit for detachable assembly over the windshield, side windows and roofless or canvas top of
the driver's cab.
The panels defining the enclosure over the bed of the truck are interlocked in such a manner that they cannot be dissembled from either inside or outside the enclosure without first removing or opening at least one panel which, in this embodiment
is a door providing an ingress and egress opening for the enclosure.  The door may be latched or locked from the outside to prevent egress, or it may be constructed to be latched or locked from the inside to prevent ingress.
According to a further feature of this invention the enclosure-defining knockdown panels are interlocked without the use of any kind of fasteners such as, for example, screws or nut and bolt assemblies.  This is accomplished by providing
interlocking formations or parts on the panels so that each panel interlocks with one or more adjacent panels.  The interlock construction prevents removal of the panels without first removing at least one predetermined panel and is such that the panels
must be assembled and dissambled in a predetermined sequence.  Furthermore, the interlocking construction of this invention and the construction detachably mounting the array of panels on the vehicle avoid the necessity of making any modification to the
vehicle in order to assemble the enclosure-defining panels on the vehicle.  The interlock construction comprises an arrangement of locking tabs or flanges on the panels.
The panel conversion kit of this invention is furthermore lightweight and can be packaged for shipment in a relatively small container.  For example, a typical conversion kit for a 21/2 ton, armed service 6 by 6 truck weighs approximately 650
pounds and can be packaged in a container that is 21/2 feet high, 8 feet long, and 3 feet wide.  It therefore can easily and readily be transported by aircraft or ground surface carriers to a desired location.
Owing to the fact that no separate fasteners of any kind are needed to assemble the kit on a vehicle, that the individual panels are lightweight, and that there is a simplified, predetermined sequence of assembly, the panels in the kit are
quickly and easily assembled on the vehicle.  For example, an untrained crew of three men can assemble the panels on a 21/2 ton armed service truck in about 5 minutes, and a trained crew of three men can do the same job in about 2 minutes.  Furthermore,
one man can assemble the panels on the vehicle if necessary, and since there are no tool-manipulated fasteners, no tools of any kind are needed to assemble the panels.  The absence of such fasteners in the security enclosure conversion kit is
additionally advantageous because fasteners such as screws or nut and bolt assemblies are easily lost, particularly in the field or battle areas.
According to a further feature of this invention, the enclosure panels are constructed with steel mesh faced with a special, semi-reflective louver screen which eliminates any view of the enclosed space from outside the vehicle.  This prevents
outsiders from sighting enclosed passengers to fire at them with firearms.  The steel mesh construction and framing provides a strength equivalent to that of a modern jail.  Also the mesh and screen afford air circulation for the comfort of passengers in
the enclosure, but prevents, substantially, the passage of liquids.  Objects such as rocks, firebombs (Molotov cocktails), and other throwable items are repelled by the spring effect of the outside louver screens on the panels.
With the foregoing in mind it is a primary object of this invention to provide a knockdown assembly of panel-like modular units for quickly and easily assembling a security enclosure on a vehicle to convert the vehicle into a carrier for
transporting prisoners or for protecting passengers to be transported from persons outside the vehicle.
A more specific object of this invention is to provide a novel knockdown enclosure assembly which is assembled on the vehicle without the use of tool-manipulated fasteners of any kind.
Another more specific object of this invention is to provide a novel knockdown, vehicle conversion, security enclosure kit comprising a series of panels which are interlocked in such a manner as to prevent the removal of the panels when at least
one panel providing an ingress-egress opening for the enclosure is closed.
Still another more specific object of this invention is to provide the panels of the enclosure-defining security with a strong mesh faced with a louver screen which provides for air circulation through the enclosure, but which is strong enough to
repel thrown objects and to prevent prisoners from breaking out.  Also the louver screen obscures a view of the interior of the enclosure for the previously mentioned advantageous reasons. Further objects of this invention will appear as the

The preferred embodiment of this invention is described for use with a 21/2 ton armed service 6 .times.  6 truck.  It will be appreciated, however, that the security conversion kit of this invention is also applicable to other types of vehicles.
Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to FIGS. 1 and 2, the vehicle to be converted with the conversion kit of this invention is, as mentioned above, shown to be a standard 21/2 ton armed forces truck 20 having a driver's cab 22
(FIG. 1) and an open load or passenger receiving bed structure 24 (FIG. 2) extending rearwardly from cab 22.  The conversion kit of this invention is divided into two assemblies 26 and 28.
Assembly 26, as shown in FIGS. 2-4, comprises a series of separately formed panels 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, and 46 for enclosing the truck bed structure 24 which is regarded to be open owing to the fact that
it is either exposed or merely covered only with a standard, unshown canvas roofing.  Assembly 28 provides protection for the occupants of cab 22 and comprises a pair of protective panels 47 and 48 (see FIGS. 1 and 3) for the side windows of the cab and
a protective panel 49 for the cab's windshield which is indicated at 51 in FIG. 1.  For a truck of the type shown in FIG. 1, only a canvas roof is provided for cab 22, and assembly 28 consequently includes a further roof or top wall panel 50 for the cab
as best shown in FIG. 3.  Panels 30-50 are of rectangular configuration as shown.
The enclosure defined by the assembly of panels 30-46, as best shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, is of inverted box-shaped configuration having a top wall or roof, two opposed side walls, and opposed front and rear endwalls.  Panels 30 and 31, as shown in
FIG. 1, define the front end wall of the enclosure.  Panels 32-35 define one of the side walls of the enclosure as shown in FIG. 1, and panels 36-39 form the other of the two side walls as shown in FIG. 3.  Panels 40-43 define the top wall of the
enclosure as shown in FIG. 3, and panels 44-46 define the rear end wall of the enclosure as shown in FIG. 2.
The bed structure 24 conventionally includes a pair of side panels 54 (one shown in FIGS. 1 and 2), a forward end panel 56 (FIG. 1), and a rear tailgate 58 (FIG. 2).  Panels 54 and 56 are of relatively short height and extend upwardly from the
edges of bed 53 in the usual manner.  Panel assembly 26 cooperates with the truck bed structure 24 to enclose the load or passenger receiving space on bed 53.
As shown in FIG. 4, panel 30 comprises a rectangular, rigid metal frame 62 which is divided into three sections of essentially equal area by two vertical, intermediate structural members 63 and 64.  Frame 62 may be formed from any suitable
structural members of sufficient strength such as, for example, angle irons.  Mounted on the three framework sections defined by frame 62 and structural member 63 and 64 is a stiff, strong screen 65 which is preferably formed from suitable expanded metal
mesh and which is preferably welded or otherwise suitably fixed to frame 62 and structural member 63 and 64.  Structural members 63 and 64 add rigidity to frame 62 and strengthen the expanded metal screen 65.
With continued reference to FIG. 4, structural members 63 and 64 are respectively provided with extensions in the form of rigid, downwardly extending support posts 70 and 71 which are interfittingly received in existing stanchion holes 73 and 74. Stanchion holes 73 and 74 are formed in the upper edge of the forward, truck bed panel 56 as shown.  A pair of rigid pins 76 and 77, which are fixed to the bottom horizontally extending portion of frame 62 adjacent to the opposite sides of the frame, are
interfittingly received in existing holes 78 and 79 which are also formed in the upper edge of panel 56.  Posts 70 and 71 are slidably insertable into stanchion holes 73 and 74 respectively, and pins 76 and 77 are slidably inserted into their respective
holes 78 and 79.  When assembled on the truck, the bottom horizontally extending portion of frame 62 seats on the upwardly facing edge of panel 56.  Panel 30 is substantially coextensive with panel 56 and spans the truck bed side panels 54.
To removably mount panel 30 on the truck bed structure 24, posts 70 and 71 need only be aligned with stanchion holes 73 and 74, and pins 76 and 77 need only be aligned with holes 78 and 79.  Upon effecting this alignment, panel 30 then is simply
dropped into place to seat on the upper edge of panel 56 as previously described.
It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that no fasteners of any kind are required for mounting panel 30 on the truck bed structure 24.  Furthermore, no modification of truck 20 is required for mounting panel 30 on the truck bed
structure.
Posts 70 and 71, when received in stanchion holes 73 and 74 provide a separable interlock that prevents the lower edge of panel 30 from being pushed outwardly from the inside of the enclosed space or from being pushed inwardly from the outside of
the truck.  Pins 76 and 77 when received in holes 78 and 79 prevent the ends of panel 30 from being bent or pushed inwardly or outwardly respectively by forces exerted from outside the enclosure and from inside the enclosure.  To remove panel 30, it is
only necessary to lift the panel until the ends of posts 70 and 71 clear the stanchion hole 73 and 74.  Frame 62 is sufficiently rigid that its upper edge cannot be bent forward to any significant degree when assembled and interlocked with other panels
of the enclosure as will presently appear.
Panel 31, which seats on top of panel 30, is similar to panel 30, and to the extent that panel 31 is like panel 30, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter a have been used to identify the parts of panel 31.  Panel 31 differs from panel 30
mainly in that it does not have any pins such as pins 76 and 77 and in that the support posts 70a and 71a instead of being aligned with structural member 63a and 64a are aligned with and extend downwardly from the vertically extending portions of frame
62a.
As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the lower, horizontally extending portion of frame 62a is seated on the horizontally extending legs of two L-shaped locking flanges 82 and 83.  The horizontally extending leg portions of flanges 82 and 83 are preferably
welded or otherwise suitably fixed to the upwardly facing edge of the upper horizontally extending portion of frame 62.  Flanges 82 and 83 are thusly fixed to frame 62 preferably equidistantly from the vertically extending portions of frame 62.  The
vertical leg portions of flanges 82 and 83 extend upwardly in overlapping relation to the inwardly facing side edge of the lower, horizontally extending portion of frame 62a.  Flanges 82 and 83, in addition to supporting panel 31 on panel 30, coact with
the inwardly facing edge of the lower horizontally extending portion of frame 62a to provide an interlock between panels 30 and 31 which prevents the lower edge of panel 31 from being pushed inwardly by exterior forces.
Posts 70a and 71a are slidably received in existing, front corner stanchions 86 and 87 which form a standard part of truck 20.  Panel 31 is readily and easily assembled in place by positioning it over panel 30, by aligning posts 70a and 71a with
the openings in stanchions 86 and 87 and by dropping panel 31 downwardly to insert posts 70a and 71a into stanchions 86 and 87.  Thus, it will be appreciated that to mount panel 31 in place, no fasteners of any kind are required, and no modifications to
truck 20 are required.  Panel 31 is substantially coextensive with panel 30.
As best shown in FIG. 6, panel 32 is a rigid, dual frame construction having an inner frame 90 and an outer frame 92.  Both frames 90 and 92 are of rigid, rectangular construction and are fabricated from suitable, rigid structural members.
Inner frame 90 is formed by a pair of parallel spaced apart horizontally extending structural members 94 and 95 and a pair of vertically extending, rigid structural members 96 and 97 which are preferably welded to the opposite ends of members 94
and 95 as shown.  Members 96 and 97 are provided with extensions in the form of legs 98 and 99 respectively.  Legs 98 and 99 project vertically downwardly from member 95, and leg 99 is slidably received in corner stanchion 86 as best shown in FIG. 7. 
Leg 98 is slidably received in an existing, intermediate stanchion 102.
Leg 99 when received in stanchion 86 abuts post 70a, and the assembly of post 70a and leg 99 interfits in stanchion 86 so that abutment of the post and the leg against each other and the inner stanchion hole surfaces prevents the right hand
portion of panel 31 from being pushed into or out of the enclosure.  Confinement of leg 99 between post 70a and the opposed internal surface of stanchion 86 prevents edgewise displacement of panel 32.  Also, abutment of legs 99 and 98 with internal
stanchion hole surfaces prevents the lower portion of panel 32 from being pushed into or out of the enclosure.
Frame 92 is rigidly fixed to frame 90 by a plurality of block-shaped spacers which are indicated generally at 104.  Fixed on the inside face of frame 92 is a relatively stiff, flat screen 106 of strong expanded metal.  Frame 92 is a two-piece
construction having an inner frame part 107 and an outer frame part 109 which are suitably rigidly fixed to each other by rivets or the like as best shown in FIG. 13.  An outside screen 108 is securely clamped between frame parts 107 and 109 and is
spaced from screen 106, again as shown in FIG. 13.
Screen 106 serves to confine detained persons or to protect passengers in the enclosure.  Screen 108 which is more resilient than screen 106 is spaced from screen 106 so that it is springy to repel thrown objects.
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 7, the lower horizontally extending portion of frame 92 interfittingly seats on the border flange 110 of the truck bed side panel 54.  Thus, frame 92 and screen 108 are disposed exteriorly of stanchions 86 and 102.  This,
as will become apparent from the subsequent description, provides a neat uninterrupted side exterior surface wherein the opposed side edges of panels 32, 33, 34, and 35 abut or are positioned very closely adjacent to each other to preclude the insertion
of objects into the enclosure as well as precluding objects from being thrown out of the enclosure.
As best shown in FIG. 8, the construction of panel 36 is identical to that of panel 32.  Accordingly, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter a have been applied to the parts of panel 36 which correspond to the previously described parts
of panel 32.  Legs 99a and 98a are respectively slidably received in stanchion 87 and a further existing, intermediate stanchion 102a.
To mount panel 32 in place after panels 30 and 31 are assembled on the truck bed structure, panel 32 is first positioned over flange 110 to align legs 99 and 98 with the holed in stanchions 86 and 102 respectively.  The panel is then dropped into
place sliding legs 99 and 98 respectively into stanchions 86 and 102 as previously described.  Panel 36 is assembled on the truck bed structure in the same manner as just described for panel 32.
From the foregoing it is clear that no fasteners of any kind are required to mount panels 32 and 36 in place.  Furthermore, no modifications of any kind are required for mounting panels 32 and 36 on the truck bed structure.  Panels 32 and 36 are
readily and easily removed after panels 33-35 and 37-46 are removed simply by raising the panels until their legs clear their respective stanchions on the truck bed structure.  Panel 36 may be assembled or removed before panel 32 is assembled or removed. Alternately, panels 32 and 36 may be assembled or removed concomitantly.
The assembly of post 71a and leg 99a interfits in stanchion 87 so that the abutment post 71a and leg 99a against each other and against the opposed internal surfaces of stanchions 86 prevents the left hand portion of panel 31 from being pushed
into or out of the enclosure.  Confinement of leg 99a between post 71a and the opposed internal surface of stanchion 87 prevents edgewise displacement of panel 36.  Also, abutment of legs 99a and 98a with internal stanchion hole surfaces prevents the
lower portion of panel 36 from being pushed into or out of the enclosure.  Frame 92a seats on the flange 110 of the left hand truck bed side panel 56, with frame 92a and screens 106a and 108a being disposed exteriorly of stanchions 87 and 102a.
Panel 43 in some respects is similar to panel 30, and to the extent that panels 43 and 30 are alike, like reference numerals, suffixed by the letter b have been applied to designate the parts of panel 43.  Panel 43 differs from panel 30 in that
it does not have parts corresponding to pins 76 and 77 and posts 70 and 71.  Panel 43 instead has a locking tab 111 for a purpose to be described in detail later on.
The side portions of frame 62b seat on the upper edges of the upper horizontally extending portions of frames 90 and 90a, and the forward or front portion of frame 62b seats on the upper edge of the upper horizontally extending portion of frame
62a as best shown in FIGS. 3, 7, 8 and 10.  This prevents panel 43 from being pushed or pulled inwardly.  The side portions of frame 62b either abut or are positioned closely adjacent to the upper horizontally extending portions of frames 92 and 92a. 
Abutment of frame 62b with frames 92 and 92a prevents sideward displacement of panel 43 by forces exerted from inside or outside the enclosure.  Also abutment of frames 92 and 92a with frame 62b prevents the upper portions of panels 32 and 36 from being
pushed or pulled inwardly.
A pair of locking flanges 115 and 116 are provided for interlocking the adjacently disposed corners of panels 31, 32, 36, and 43.  An additional locking flange 114 provides a further interlock between panels 31 and 43.
With reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, flange 114 is of inverted L-shaped configuration having a vertical leg fixed as by welding to the upper horizontally extending portion of frame 62a equidistantly between the sides of frame 62a.  The horizontally
extending leg portion of flange 114 overlaps the forward transverse or end portion of frame 62b so that the forward portion of frame 62b is confined between the horizontally extending leg portion of flange 114 and the upwardly facing edge of the upper
horizontally extending portion of frame 62a.  Abutment of frame 62b with the horizontally extending leg portion of flange 114 prevents the central portion of the forward edge of panel 43 from being pushed or pulled upwardly.
Flange 115, as best shown in FIG. 6, comprises an inverted L-shaped portion 120 and a plate-like portion 121.  The vertical leg of portion 120 is fixed as by welding to the inwardly facing surface of the upper, horizontally extending part of
frame 92, and the horizontally extending leg of portion 120 overlaps the right hand forward corner of frame 62b as best shown in FIGS. 3 and 10.  Abutment of the right hand, forward corner of frame 62b with the overlapping horizontal leg of portion 120
prevents the right hand corner of panel 43 from being pushed or pulled upwardly.  Portion 121, which is preferably welded to portion 120, extends at right angles to the legs of portion 120 and overlaps the upper, right hand corner of frame 62a.  This
interlocking construction prevents the upper, right hand corner of panel 31 from being pushed or pulled outwardly from the enclosure.
As best shown in FIGS. 3 and 8, the construction of locking flange 116 is the same as that just described for flange 115, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter a being applied to the portions of flange 116.  As shown, the vertical leg of
portion 120a is fixed as by welding to the upper horizontally extending part of frame 92a, and the horizontal leg of portion 120a overlaps the forward, left hand corner of frame 62b to prevent the forward, left hand corner of panel 43 from being pushed
or pulled upwardly.  Portion 121a, which overlaps the upper, left hand corner of frame 62a, prevents the upper, left hand corner of panel 31 from being pushed or pulled outwardly.
Except for locking flange 115, panel 33 is essentially of the same construction as panel 32, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter b being applied to designate the parts of panel 33 as best shown in FIGS. 1 and 7.
With continued reference to FIG. 7, leg 99b is slidably received in stanchion 102 along with leg 98.  Leg 98b is slidably received in another, existing, intermediate, upwardly opening stanchion 130.  It will be noted that all of the previously
described truck stanchions as well as those yet to be described are vertical and open upwardly.
The assembly of legs 98 and 99b in stanchion 102 as well as the confinement of panel 33 between panels 32 and 34 prevents edgewise displacement of panel 33.  Also, engagement of legs 99b and 98b against the interior surfaces of stanchions 102 and
130 prevent the lower portion of panel 33 from being pushed or pulled inwardly or outwardly.  The lower horizontally extending portion of frame 92b seats on the flange 110 of the right hand truck bed side panel 56.
The construction of panel 37 is the same as that just described for panel 33.  Accordingly, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter c have been applied to designate those parts of panel 37 which correspond to panel 33.
As shown in FIG. 8, leg 99c is received in stanchion 102a, and leg 98c is received in another existing vertical, upwardly opening stanchion 130a.  The lower horizontally extending portion of frame 92c seats on the border flange 110 of the left
hand truck bed side panel 56.  The assembly of legs 98a and 98c interfit in stanchion 102a to confine panel 37 against edgewise displacement.  Also, panel 37 is confined against edgewise displacement between panels 36 and 38.
The assembly of frames 92b and screens 106b and 108b is disposed exteriorly of stanchion 102 and 130.  Similarly, the assembly of frame 92c and screens 106c and 108c is disposed exteriorly of stanchions 102a and 130a.
In place of flange 115, panel 33 is provided with a locking flange 132 having an inverted L-shaped configuration.  The vertical leg of flange 132 is fixed as by welding to the inside face of the forward, upper corner of frame 92b and projects
forwardly into the space between frames 90 and 92 in the region of the rearward upper corner of panel 32 to thus interlock the adjacent upper corners of panels 32 and 33 and to thereby preclude either panel from being pushed or pulled inwardly or
outwardly relative to the other.  The horizontal leg portion of flange 132 overlaps the right, rear corner of frame 62b.  Abutment of the right rear corner of frame 62b with the horizontal leg of flange 132 prevents the right rear corner of panel 43 from
being pushed or pulled outwardly.
Panel 37 also is provided with a flange 132c which is identical to flange 132.  Flange 132c is fixed to frame 92c in the same manner as that described for flange 132.  The vertical leg portion of flange 132c extends between frames 92a and 90a in
the region of the rear upper corner of panel 36 to thus interlock panels 36 and 37 and thereby prevent the adjacently disposed regions of either panel from being pushed or pulled inwardly or outwardly relative to the other panel.  The horizontal leg of
flange 132c overlaps the left rear corner of frame 62b.  Abutment of frame 62b with the horizontal leg of flange 132c prevents the left rear corner of panel 43 from being pushed or pulled upwardly.
The horizontal legs of flanges 115 and 132 and the opposing surface of the upper horizontally extending portion of frame 92 provide a right hand channel for slidably receiving the right marginal side edge of panel 43.  Similarly, the horizontal
legs of flanges 116 and 132c and the opposing surface of the upper horizontally extending portion of frame 92a define a left hand channel for slidably receiving the marginal left hand edge of panel 43.  To mount panels 43 in place, therefore, it is
merely slid into the right and left hand channels mentioned above.  Abutment of the forward corners of frame 62b with flange portions 121 and 121a prevent panel 43 from being slid forwardly from its illustrated position by forces exerted interiorly or
exteriorly of the enclosure.
After panels 30-32, 36 and 43 are assembled, panels 33 and 37 are then assembled by positioning each panel with its legs aligned over its respective stanchion holes and by dropping the panel down into place.  It thus will be appreciated that no
fasteners of any kind are required to mount panels 33 and 37 in place.  Furthermore, no modifications to truck 20 are required for mounting panels 33 and 37 on the truck bed structure 24.  Panels 33 and 37 are readily and easily removed after panels 34,
35 and 38-46 are removed simply by raising the panels until their legs clear their respective stanchions on the truck bed structure.  Panel 37, of course, may be assembled or removed before panel 33 is assembled or removed.
With the exception of the locking tab construction, panel 42 is of the same construction as panel 43.  Accordingly, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter c have been applied to designate corresponding parts of panel 42.
As shown in FIGS. 3 and 9, panel 42 has three plate-like locking tabs 134, 135 and 136 which extend forwardly from the forward transverse portion of frame 62c.  The adjacently disposed portion of frame 62b overlaps tabs 134-136 so that abutment
of tabs 134-136 with the rearward transverse portion of frame 62b prevents the forward edge of panel 42 from being pushed or pulled upwardly.  Tabs 134-136 also prevent the rearward edge of panel 43 from being pushed or pulled downwardly.
Tab 111, which is fixed to frame 62b, extends over the forward transverse portion of frame 62c.  As a result, abutment of frame 62c with tab 111 prevents panel 42 from being pushed or pulled upwardly along its forward edge.  Also, abutment of tab
111 with frame 62c prevents the rearward edge of panel 43 from being pushed or pulled downwardly.
The horizontally extending legs of flanges 132 and 132c overlap the forward right and left corners of frame 62c.  Thus abutment of the right and left corners of frame 62c with the horizontal legs of flanges 132 and 132c prevent the right and left
forward corners of panel 42 from being pushed or pulled upwardly.
The side portions of frame 62c seat on the upwardly facing edge surfaces on the upper horizontally extending portions of frames 90b and 90c.  This prevents panel 42 from being pushed or pulled downwardly.  Abutment of frame 62c with opposing
surfaces on frames 92b and 92c prevents sideward displacement of panel 42.  Abutment of frames 92b and 92c with the side portions of frame 62c prevent panels 33 and 37 from being pushed or pulled inwardly.
With continuing reference to FIGS. 3 and 7, panel 34 is of substantially the same construction as panel 33.  Accordingly, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter d have been applied to designate the corresponding parts of panel 34.  As
shown in FIG. 7, leg 99d is slidably received in stanchion 130, and the assembly of legs 98b and 99d interfit in the stanchion to restrain displacement of panel 34 in the same manner described in connection with panel 33.  Also, panel 34 is confined
against edgewise displacement by confinement between panels 33 and 35.  Leg 98d is slidably received in another existing, intermediate vertical, truck stanchion 136.  The lower horizontally extending portion of frame 92d seats on flange 110 of the right
hand bed structure side panel 56.
As shown in FIG. 8, panel 38 is of identical construction as panel 37.  Accordingly, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter e have been applied to designate the corresponding parts of panel 38.  Legs 99c and 98e are slidably received in
stanchion 130a and another existing intermediate, vertical, upwardly opening stanchion 136a.
The reception of legs 99d and 98d in stanchions 130 and 136 as well as the confinement of panels 34 between panels 33 and 35 prevent edgewise and sideward movement of panel 34 in the manner similar to that described for panel 33.  Similarly,
edgewise and sideward movement of panel 38 is prevented by reception of legs 99e and 98e in stanchions 130a and 136a as well as confinement of panel 38 between panels 37 and 39.  After panels 30-33, 36, 37, 42 and 43 are assembled, each of the panels 34
and 38 are readily and easily mounted in place by positioning the legs of each panel in alignment with its respective stanchions and by dropping the panel down into place.  After panels 35, 44-46 are removed, panel 34 is simply and easily removed by
lifting it until its legs 99d and 98d clear stanchions 130 and 136.  After panels 35, 39, 40, 41 and 44-46 are removed, panel 38 is simply and easily removed simply by lifting it until its legs 99e and 98e clear stanchions 130a and 136a.  It therefore
will be appreciated that no fasteners of any kind are required for mounting panels 34 and 38 in place.  Also, no modification of any kind is required for mounting panels 34 and 38 on truck 20.  Panels 34 and 38 may be assembled and removed in any
selected order or they may be assembled and removed concomitantly.  The screens and outer frames of panels 34 and 38 are disposed exteriorly of their respective stanchions.
As shown in FIG. 3, panel 41 is of the same construction as panel 42.  Accordingly, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter d have been applied to designate those parts of panel 41 which correspond to panel 42.
As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the right and left side portions of frame 62d seat on the upper horizontally extending portions of frame 90d and 90e.  This prevents panel 41 from being pushed or pulled downwardly.  Abutting engagement of the side
portions of frames 62d with the opposed surfaces on frames 92d and 92e prevent sideward movement of panel 41.  Also, abutment of frames 92d and 92e with the opposing side portions of frame 62d prevent the upper edges of panels 34 and 38 from being pushed
or pulled inwardly.
Locking tabs 134d and 136d as well as the unshown tab corresponding to locking tab 135 are fixed to the forward transversely extending portion of frame 62d and extend under the adjacent transversely extending rearward portion of frame 62c. 
Abutment of these tabs, which are welded to frame 62d, with frame 62c thus prevents the forward edge of panel 41 from being pushed or pulled upwardly.  Tab 111c which is fixed as by welding to the rearwardly extending transverse portion of frame 62c
extends over the forwardly extending transverse portion of frame 62d to thus prevent the rearwardly extending edge of panel 42 from being pushed or pulled downwardly.
The horizontal leg of flange 132d overlaps the right hand forward corner of frame 62d.  Thus, abutment of the right forward corner of frame 62d with the horizontal leg of flange 132d prevents the right hand corner of panel 41 from being pushed or
pulled upwardly.  Similarly, the horizontal leg of flange 132e overlaps the left hand forward corner of frame 62d.  As a result, abutment of frame 62d with the horizontal leg of flange 132e prevents the left hand corner of panel 41 from being pushed or
pulled upwardly.
As best shown in FIGS. 7 and 11, the construction of panel 35 is essentially the same as that just described for panel 34 with the exception that a further locking tab 140 has been added on the top rearward corner of the panel 35.  Accordingly,
like reference numerals suffixed by the letter f have been applied to designate the corresponding parts of panel 35.
Legs 99f and 98f are, as shown in FIG. 7, respectively slidably received in stanchion 136 and a further, existing, vertical, right rear corner truck stanchion 142.  The lower horizontally extending portion of frame 92f seats on flange 110 of the
right hand truck bed structure side panel 56.  Sidward and edgewise movement of panel 35 is restrained by abutment of legs 99f and 98f with opposing surfaces in stanchions 136 and 142.  The assembly of frame 92f and screens 106f and 108f is disposed
exteriorly of stanchions 136 and 142 as best shown in FIG. 1.
The vertical leg of flange 132f extends between frames 90d and 92d in the region of the rearward upper corner of panel 34.  This interlocks panel 34 and 35 to prevent either of the two panels from being pushed or pulled inwardly or outwardly
relative to the other.  The horizontal leg of flange 132f overlaps the rearward right corner of frame 62d.  Thus, abutment of frame 62d with the horizontal leg of flange 132f prevents the rearward right corner of panel 41 from being pushed or pulled
upwardly.
As best shown in FIG. 8, the construction of panel 39 is the same as that described for panel 38 except that a furtherlocking flange 144 has been added to the upper rearward corner of panel 39.  Accordingly, like reference numerals suffixed by
the letter g have been applied to designate corresponding parts of panel 39.
Legs 99g and 98g are slidably and interfittingly received in stanchions 136a and a further existing vertical, upwardly opening, left rear corner truck stanchion 142a.  The lower horizontally extending portion of frame 92g seats on flange 110 of
the left hand truck bed structure side panel 56.  Confinement of panel 39 against edgewise and sideward movement is similar to that described for panel 35.
The vertical leg portion of flange 132g extends between frames 90e and 92e in the rearward upper corner of panel 38.  This interlocks panels 39 and 38 to prevent either of the two panels from being pushed or pulled inwardly or outwardly relative
to the other.  The horizontal leg of flange 32g overlaps the left corner of frame 62d.  Thus, abutment of frame 62d with the horizontal leg of flange 132g prevents the left rear corner of panel 41 from being pushed or pulled upwardly.
The horizontal legs of flanges 132d and 132f cooperate with the upper horizontally extending portion of frame 90d to provide a right hand channel which slidably receives the right hand marginal side edge of panel 41.  Similarly, the horizontally
extending legs of flanges 132e and 132g cooperate with the upper horizontally extending portion of frame 90e to provide a left hand channel which slidably receives the left hand marginal edge of panel 41.  Thus the right and left hand sides of panel 41
are easily slid into the channels mentioned above to position panel 41 in the manner shown in FIG. 3.  It therefore will be appreciated that no fasteners of any kind are required to mount panel 41 in place.
After panels 30-34, 36-38, and 41-43 are assembled, panel 35 is simply and easily assembled in place by aligning legs 99f and 98f with stanchions 136 and 142 respectively and by dropping the panel down into place.  After panels 30-34 and 36-38
and 41-43 are assembled, panel 39 is easily removably assembled in place by aligning legs 99g and 98g respectively with stanchions 136a and 142a and by dropping the panels down into place.  Panels 35 and 39 may be assembled in any selected order, or they
may be assembled concomitantly.
After panels 44-46 and 40 are removed, panels 35 and 39 may be removed concomitantly or in any selected order simply by lifting each panel until its legs clear its respective stanchions.  From the foregoing it will be appreciated that no
fasteners of any kind are required to mount panels 35 and 39 in place.  Also, no modification of truck 20 is required for mounting or removing panels 35 and 39.
As shown in FiG. 3, the construction of panel 40 is the same as panel 41 with the main exception that the tab corresponding to locking tab 111d has been eliminated.  Accordingly, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter e have been applied
to designate the corresponding parts of panel 40.
As shown in FIG. 3, the locking tabs 134e and 136e as well as the unshown locking tab corresponding to tab 135 are fixed to the forward transversely extending portion of frame 64e and are overlapping by the rearward transversely extending portion
of frame 62d.  Abutment of these locking tabs with the rearward transversely extending portion of frame 62d prevents the forward edge of panel 40 from being pushed or pulled upwardly.
Locking tab 111d overlaps the forward transversely extending portion of frame 62e.  Thus, abutment of locking tab 111d with frame 62e prevents the rearward edge of panel 41 from being pushed or pulled downwardly.
The side portions of frame 62e seat on the upper horizontally extending portions of frame 90f and 90g.  This prevents panel 40 from being pushed or pulled downwardly.  Sideward movement of panel 40 is prevented by abutting engagement of the side
portions of frame 62e with opposing surfaces on frames 92f and 92g in a manner similar to that previously described for the other top or roof panels.  Also, abutment of frames 92f and 92g with the side portions of frame 62e prevent the upper portions of
panels 35 and 39 from being pushed or pulled inwardly.
As shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, flange 140 is formed with an inverted, L-shaped configuration having a vertical leg fixed as by welding to the inside face of the upper rear corner of frame 92f.  The horizontal leg of flange 140 overlaps the right
rear corner of frame 62e as shown in FIG. 3.  Thus, abutment of frame 62e with the horizontal leg of flange 140 prevents the right rear corner of panel 40 from being pushed or pulled upwardly.  Flange 144 is of the same construction as flange 140 and has
a vertical leg which is fixed as by welding to the inside face of the upper rear corner of frame 92g.  The horizontal leg of flange 144 overlaps the left rear corner of frame 62e.  Thus, abutment of frame 62e with the horizontal leg of flange 144
prevents the left rear corner of panel 40 from being pushed or pulled upwardly.
The horizontal legs of flanges 132f and 140 cooperate with the upper horizontal portion of frame 90f to provide a right hand channel for slidably receiving the right hand side portion of panel 40.  Similarly, the horizontal legs of flanges 132g
and 144 cooperate with the upper horizontal portion of frame 90g to provide a left hand channel which slidably receives the left hand side portion of panel 40.  Panel 40 is thus assembled by slidably inserting the panel into the channels mentioned above
after panels 30-39 and 41-43 have been assembled.  It therefore will be appreciated that no fasteners of any kind are required for mounting panel 40 in place.
The assembly of frame 92f and screens 106f and 108f are disposed exteriorly of stanchions 136 and 142 as best shown in FIG. 1.  Similarly, the assembly of frame 92g and screens 106g and 108g is disposed exteriorly of stanchions 136a and 142a. 
Panels 40-42 are coextensive with panel 43, and all four panels 40-43 span the space between the side walls defined on the right side by panels 32-35 and on the left side by panels 36-39.
As shown in FIG. 7, a further locking tab 150 is fixed as by welding to the rearward vertical portion of frame 92 and extends between frames 90b and 92b to provide a further interlock between panels 32 and 33 in the same manner that the vertical
leg portion of flange 132 interlocks the two panels.  A similar locking tab 150a is fixed to panel 36 as shown in FIG. 8 and extends between frames 90c and 92c to provide a further interlock between panels 36 and 37 in a manner similar to the interlock
provided by locking tab 150.
Referring back to FIG. 7, a locking tab 152b is fixed to frame 90b and extends between frames 90d and 92d to provide an interlock between panels 33 and 34 in the same manner as described in connection with locking tab 150.  A similar locking tab
152c is fixed as by welding to frame 92c and extends between frames 90e and 92e to provide another interlock between panels 37 and 38 in the manner similar to that described in connection with locking tab 150a.
Referring again to FIG. 7, still another locking tab 154d is fixed as by welding to frame 92d and extends between frames 90f and 92f to provide a further interlock between panels 34 and 35 in the manner similar to that described in connection
with locking tab 150.  Also, a locking tab 154e (see FIG. 8) is fixed to frame 92e and extends between frames 90g and 92g to provide a further interlock between panels 38 and 39 in the manner similar to that described in connection with locking tab 150a.
As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, truck 20 is conventionally provided with right hand and left hand wooden bench seats 160 and 162 which are pivotable between their illustrated seating positions and raised or upright positions.
The backrests for bench seats 160 and 162 are respectively indicated at 164 and 166.  As shown, bench seats 160 and 162 and backrests 164 and 166 are contained within the enclosure defined by panels 30-46.
As shown in FIG. 2, panel 45 comprises a two-piece frame 170 having two frame parts 171 and 172 which are securely fixed to each other by rivets or other suitable means, an outer screen 174 which is clamped between frame parts 171 and 172, and an
inner screen 176 which is fixed as by welding to the inner face of frame part 172 in spaced relation to outer screen 174.
Screen 174 is preferably made from the same material as screens 108, 108a, 108b, 108d, 108e, and 108g.  The material for these screens is conventional and preferably is a woven, louvered, bronze shade screen material manufactured by Coolshade
Corporation of Glendale, Calif.  Inner screen 176 preferably is made from relatively stiff, strong expanded steel mesh.
Fixed to the right hand edge of frame 170 are a pair of hinges 180 and 181 which are formed from suitable steel rods and which are received in rigid vertical metal sleeves 182 and 183.  Sleeves 182 and 183 are fixed as by welding to the rearward
vertical portion of frame 90f.  Sleeves 182 and 183 are axially aligned to thus provide a vertical pivot axis about which panel 45 is pivotable between the illustrated closed position and an outwardly-swung open position.
Panel 45 may be locked in its illustrated closed position by a spring biased bolt lock assembly 177 which is fixed to the upper left corner of frame 170.  The lock bolt of assembly 177 is normally spring biased into a catch comprising a bracket
175 which is welded or otherwise suitably fixed on the rearward edge of frame 62e.  A chain 178 secured to the bolt of assembly 177 extends downwardly and has a free end fixed by any sutiable means to frame part 171.  By pulling chain 178, the bolt of
assembly 177 is withdrawn from bracket 175 to release the lock provided between panel 45 and 40.
Still referring to FIG. 2, an additional latch is provided in the form of a locking tab 179 which is pivotably mounted on a support bracket 173 to be positioned over the upper flange of tailgate 58 when the tailgate is swung to its illustrated
closed position.  Bracket 179 is welded or otherwise suitably fixed to frame part 171 as shown.
Panel 44 and the latching or locking structure therefor is the same as that just described for panel 45.  Accordingly, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter a have been applied to designate corresponding parts of panel 44.  Sleeves 182a
and 184a are fixed as by welding to frame 90g, and bracket 175a is fixed to the rearward edge of frame 62e.  Panels 44 and 45 are thus hinged to swing outwardly from their illustrated closed positions.
Panel 46 in some respects is similar to panel 45, and to the extent that panels 46 and 45 are alike, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter b have been applied to designate the corresponding parts of panel 46.  Panel 46 differs from panel
45 mainly in its hinge construction and in the latching construction for securing panel 46 in its illustrated closed position.
As shown in FIG. 14, panel 46 is provided with a pair of hinges 190 and 191.  Hinges 190 and 191 comprise rigid metal rods which are fixed as by welding to frame 170b and which are received in aligned, rigid, metal sleeves 193 and 194
respectively.  Sleeves 193 and 194 are fixed as by welding to the underside of the rearward transversely extending portion of frame 62e.  Panel 46 is thus swingable about a horizontal axis between its illustrated closed position and an inwardly swung
open position where the lower end of the panel is raised.
Still referring to FIG. 14, panel 46 is latched to panels 45 and 44 by slide bolt lock assemblies 196 and 197 respectively.  Assembly 196 is conventional and comprises a bolt 198 which is slidable in a sleeve 199 for insertion into an axially
aligned latching sleeve 200.  Sleeve 200 is fixed as by welding to the underside of frame 170, and sleeve 199 is fixed as by welding to the lower portion of frame 170b.
Assembly 197 is of the same construction as assembly 196.  Accordingly, like reference numerals suffixed by the letter a have been applied to designate corresponding parts of assembly 197.  Sleeve 200a is fixed to the underside of frame 170a as
by welding, and sleeve 197a is fixed as by welding to the lower portion of frame 170b.
After panels 30-39 and 40-43 are assembled in the previously described manner, panels 44-46 are assembled in any selected order, or they may be assembled concomitantly.  Assembly of panel 45 is readily and easily effected by aligning hinges 180
and 181 with sleeves 182 and 183 and by lowering the panel to insert hinges 180 and 181 into sleeves 182 and 183.  Similarly, panel 44 is readily and easily assembled by aligning its hinges with sleeves 182a and 184a and by lowering the panel to insert
the hinges into the sleeves.  With panels 44 and 45 either removed or in their opened positions, panel 46 is readily and easily assembled by aligning its hinges 190 and 191 with sleeves 193 and 194 and by sidewardly moving the panel to insert hinges 190
and 191 into sleeves 193 and 194.  Panel 46 cannot be removed except by opening panel 44 or by removing panel 44.  Panel 46 is swingable about its hinge axis into the interior of the enclosure defined by the assembly of panels 30-46.
As shown in FIG. 2, the upper flanged portion of tailgate 58 overlaps the lower portions of panels 44-46 when the tailgate is swung to its illustrated closed position.  To open any one or more of the panels 44-46, it is therefore first necessary
to swing locking tabs 179 and 179a away from their illustrated tailgate locking positions and to then swing tailgate 58 down to its opened position.  Panel 46 then may be opened by sliding bolts 198 and 198a back to their unlocked positions and also by
pulling on chains 178 and 178a to remove the bolts of assemblies 175 and 175a from the locking brackets 177 and 177a.  All three panels now may be opened to provide ingress into and egress from the enclosure.
It will be appreciated from the foregoing that no fasteners of any kind are required for mounting panels 44-46 on panels 39, 43 and 35 respectively.  Also, no modifications of any kind are required to truck 20 for assembling panels 44-46.
Owing to the interlocking construction previously described for panels 30-46, panels 30-46 can only be assembled and removed in a predetermined sequence.  In assembly, it is necessary to assemble the panels in the following order: panel 30, panel
31, the sub-assembly of side panels 32 and 36, panel 43, the sub-assembly of side panels 33 and 37, panel 42, the sub-assembly of side panels 34 and 38, panel 41, the sub-assembly of side panels 38 and 39, panel 40, and finally the sub-assembly of panels
44-46.  Removal of panels 30-46 is the reverse of the order for the assembly just described.
From the foregoing, it will further be appreciated that when panels 30-46 are assembled and when panels 44-46 are latched closed, none of the panels 30-39 may individually be disassembled or opened sufficiently to provide ingress or egress of
objects or persons.  Furthermore, it will be appreciated that no modification of any kind is required to truck 20 for mounting panels 30-46 in place.  In addition, no separate fasteners of any kind are needed for assembling the panels in the manner just
described.  More particularly, no fasteners that require manipulation by tools (such as threaded type fasteners) are required for assembling panels 30-46.
As shown in FIG. 2, rigid bars 219 and 219a are welded to the underside of frame 62e to provide stops for limiting inward movement of panels 45 and 46 beyond their illustrated closed positions.  This stop construction also prevents panel 40 from
being displaced rearwardly when panels 44 and 45 are latched in their closed positions.
As shown in FIG. 8, an L-shaped locking flange 218 has a vertical leg welded to the inside face of frame part 172 and a horizontal leg which overlaps the rearward marginal edge of bench seat 160 when the bench seat is in its lowered, seating
postion.  Thus when panels 44-46 are latched closed and when the tailgate 58 is latched in its raised position, bench seat 160 cannot be raised and prevents the lower portion of panel 45 from being pulled inwardly.  This interlock prevents detained
persons from reaching outside to manipulate any of the locks for panels 44-46.
As shown in FIG. 8, locking flange 218a is of the same construction as flange 218, is welded to the inside face of frame part 172a, and coacts with bench seat 162 in the same manner as described in conjunction with flange 218 and bench seat 160.
The full opened positions of panels 44 and 45 may be such that in their fully opened positions panels 44 and 45 block removal of panel 40.  It will be appreciated, however, that panels 44 and 45 may alternately be swingable sufficiently far to be
out of the removal path of panel 40, thus allowing panel 40 to be disassembled while panels 44 and 45 are still hinged to panels 39 and 35 respectively.
From the foregoing description it will be appreciated that the assembly of panels 30-46 are detachably mounted on bed structure 24 without the use of fasteners of any kind.  The assembly of panels 30-46 cannot be lifted as a unit off bed
structure 24 owing to the frictional engagement of legs 70, 71, 70a, 71a, 98, 99, 98a, 99a, 98b, 99b, 98c, 99c, 98d, 99d, 98e, 99e, 98f, 99f, 98g, and 99g in their respective stanchion holes and also owing to the fact that it would be extremely difficult
to keep the panel assembly centered or properly aligned with the bed structure stanchion holes to prevent the panel legs from canting and thereby interlocking with the internal stanchion hole surfaces.
From the foregoing description it will also be appreciated that the outer frames and screens of panels 32-39 are disposed exteriorly of the bed structure stanchions.  This, in addition to providing a neat exterior, also provides two exterior side
wall surfaces which are only interrupted by the relatively small clearance spaces between adjacently disposed ones of panels 32-39.
Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 15, panel 49 comprises inner and outer rigid rectangular frames 220 and 222.  Frames 220 and 222 are constructed from any suitable structural members.  Frame 222 has inner and outer frame parts 223 and 224 which are
rigidly fixed together by rivets or other suitable means.  Clamped between frame part 223 and 224 is an outer screen 226 which is preferably made from the same material as screen 108.  An inner screen 228 is fixed as by welding to the inwardly facing
side of frame 220 in spaced parallel relation to screen 226.  Screen 228 is preferably formed from relatively stiff, strong expanded metal mesh.
Frame 220 is rigidly fixed to frame part 223 by any suitable means such as welding.  An upstanding structural member 230 extends perpendicularly between the horizontally extending portions of frame 220 about midway between the side portions of
frame 220.  Structural member 230 is welded or otherwise suitably fixed to the horizontally extending portions of frame 220 to add rigidity to the frame and to provide further support for screen 228.
Still referring to FIGS. 1 and 15, a pair of rigid pipe sections 232 and 234 are fixed as by welding to the lower horizontally extending portions of frame 220 and respectively interfittingly seat in existing hood hinges 236 and 238 on the hood of
truck 20.  Corresponding ends of a pair of coiled springs 240 and 241 (see FIG. 3) are respectively anchored to the upper left and right hand corners of frame 220 by any suitable means.  Springs 240 and 241 extend downwardly and have lower, hooked ends
which are hooked over the existing windshield adjustment handles 244 on opposite sides of windshield 51.  Springs 240 and 241 are tensioned to bias the upper edge of panel 49 downwardly into separable, firm seating engagement with the upper horizontally
extending edge of the windshield frame and to further exert a downward force on panel 49 to firmly seat pipe sections 232 and 234 in hood hinges 236 and 238.  Springs 240 and 241, by exerting the downwardly extending force just described, thus firmly
wedge panel 49 between the upper edge of the windshield frame and hood hinges 236 and 238 to secure panel 49 in place.
From the foregoing it will be appreciated that no modifications of any kind are required to truck 20 for mounting panel 49 in place.  To assemble panel 49, pipe sections 232 and 234 are first separably seated on hood hinges 236 and 238.  Springs
240 and 241 are then extended to hook over the windshield adjustment handles 244.  Pipe sections 232 and 234, being separably seated in hood hinges 236 and 238, provide a horizontal pivot axis extending along the lower edge of frame 220 to enable panel
49 to be swung rearwardly as springs 240 and 241 are extended, thus firmly wedging panel 49 between the upper edge of the windshield frame and hood hinges 236 and 238.  Panel 49 is readily and easily removed by unhooking springs 240 and 241 and by
lifting panel 49 off the vehicle.
As best shown in FIG. 15, panel 47 comprises a rectangular frame assembly 260 having inner and outer frames 261 and 262.  Frame 262 is formed with inner and outer frame parts 264 and 265 which are securely fixed together by rivets or other
suitable means.  A screen 268 is securely clamped between frame parts 264 and 265 and is preferably fabricated from the same material used to form screen 108.  An inner screen 270 is fixed as by welding to the inside face of frame 261 in spaced
parallelrelation to screen 268.  Screen 270 is formed from relatively stiff, strong expanded metal mesh.  Frame 262 is rigidly fixed to frame part 264 by any suitable means such as welding.
Still referring to FIG. 15, the forward vertical portion of frame 262 is provided with an extension in the form of a leg 272 which extends downwardly along the exterior of the cab door 274 adjacent to the hinged end of the door.  Fixed to leg 272
as by welding are a pair of aligned, support hinge members 276 and 277 which are slidably received in aligned, existing metal side door hinge sleeve members 278 and 279.
When hinge members 276 and 277 are received in sleeve members 278 and 279, the subassembly of frame assembly 260 and screens 268 and 270 are positioned in front of the side window of cab door 274 in overlapping relation thereto.
As shown in FIG. 16, a rigid, horizontally extending structural member 278 has an upper vertically extending leg 279 fixed as by welding to the lower horizontally extending portion of frame 262.  Structural member 278 is further formed with a
downwardly extending vertical leg 280 and a horizontal leg 281 extending between and integrally joining legs 279 and 280.
When panel 47 is assembled on door 274, leg 280 is received in the window channel 284 which is formed between the inner and outer panels 285 and 286 of the door.  Leg 281 seats on the upper edge of the outer door panel 286 as shown in FIG. 16. 
Leg 280 extends between the inside flanged end 288 of outer door part 286 and the window which is indicated at 290 in FIG. 16.  Thus, member 278 does not interfere with the cranking of window 290 between its illustrated open position and its closed
position.
Also fixed, as by welding, to frame 262 adjacent to the handle end of door 274 is a leg 292 which extends downwardly from frame 262 along the exterior of door 274 as shown in FIGS. 15 and 16.  The lateral distance between leg 292 and leg 280 is
just slightly greater than the width or thickness extending between the outer surface of door panel 286 and the inwardly facing, channel defining surface of the flanged end 288.  Legs 292 and 280 thereby coact to provide an interlock which prevents the
lower edge of the framed portion of panel 47 from being pushed or pulled inwardly or outwardly relative to door 274.  In addition, seating engagement of leg 281 on the upper edge of outer door panel 286 provides further support for panel 47 on door 274.
Hinge members 276 and 277 coact with the existing hinge sleeve 278 and 279 to keep the upper edge of the framed portion of panel 47 from being pushed inwardly and outwardly.  Also, the length of leg 272 is sufficiently long so that when it bears
against the outer door panel 286 it also assists in preventing the upper edge of the framed panel portion from being pushed outwardly.  Leg 292, in bearing against the outer surface of door panel 286, also assists in preventing the upper edge of the
framed panel portion from being pushed outwardly.  Engagement of hinge members 276 and 277 in sleeve members 278 and 279 also prevents edgewise movement of panel 47 in either direction.
To assemble panel 47 on the cab of truck 20, it is only necessary to align hinge members 276 and 277 with sleeve members 278 and 279 and to align leg 280 with the door channel 284.  Panel 47 then may be dropped into place by inserting leg 280
into channel 284, by inserting hinge members 276 and 277 into sleeve members 278 and 279, and by disposing leg 292 on the exterior of the outer door panel 286 as shown.  It thus will be appreciated that no fasteners of any kind are required for mounting
panel 247 on cab door 274.  It further will be appreciated that no modification to cab door 274 or any other part of truck 20 is required for mounting panel 47 in place.  Panel 47 is simply and easily removed simply by lifting it until hinge members 276
and 277 clear sleeve members 278 and 279.  Furthermore, it will be appreciated that when panel 47 is assembled in place, it does not interfere with the operation of window 290.
Panel 48 which is mounted on the left hand door of cab 22 is of the same construction as panel 47 and is mounted and disassembled in the same manner just described for panel 47.
As shown in FIG. 3, panel 50 comprises a rigid, rectangular frame 300 and a screen 302 of relatively stiff, strong expanded metal mesh which is welded to frame 300.  An intermediae structural member 304 extends between the forward and rearward
transversely extending portions of frame 300 about midway between the side portions of frame 300.  Structural member 304 is welded at opposite ends to the transversely extending portions of frame 300.  At the right and left hand rearward corners of panel
50 relatively short, downwardly extending pipe sections 306 and 307 are welded to frame 300 and receive existing, unshown roof support legs of cab 222.  At the forward right and left corners of panel 50, two tabs indicated at 308 are welded to frame 300
and hook over the existing front windshield corner posts of the cab.  Tabs 308 and the coaction of pipe sections 306 and 307 with the unshown roof support legs of the cab secure panel 50 in place.  Panel 50 completely covers the roof of cab 22.
From the foregoing it will be appreciated that no modifications of any kind are required to truck 20 for mounting panels 30-50 in place.  The complete assembly of panels 30-50 for truck 20 weighs approximately 650 pounds and can be packaged in a
relatively small container that is 21/2 feet high, 8 feet long, and 3 feet wide.  It therefore can be readily and easily transported by aircraft or ground surface carriers to a desired location.  Furthermore, no separate fasteners of any kind are
required for assembling panels 30-50 in place.  This simplifies the assembly and disassembly of panels 30-50.  For truck 20, an untrained crew of three men can assemble panels 30-50 in about 5 minutes, and a trained crew of three men can do the same job
in about 2 minutes.
The outer screens on panels 47-49, 32-35, 36-39, and 44-46, in addition to being resilient for repelling thrown objects, are also formed from the previously described material to provide a mirror effect which obscures a view of the interior of
the cab and the rear bed structure enclosure from the outside of the truck.  Furthermore, the screened construction of panels 30-50 provide for free circulation of air through the cab of the truck and also through the enclosure on the truck bed structure
24.  The outer screens mentioned above, however, substantially preclude the passage of liquids, thus providing additional protection to the passengers.
It will be noted that seating engagement of the interlocked panels 40-43 on the inner frames of the adjacently disposed ones of panels 32-39 prevents panels 32-39 from individually being pushed or pulled upwardly.  Also, the horizontal legs of
flanges 132, 132c, 132d, 132e, 132f, and 132g overlap the upper rearward corners of frames 90, 90a, 90b, 90c, 90d, and 90e to provide a further interlock that prevents panels 32-34 and 36-38 from individually being pushed or pulled upwardly.
As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, a pair of rigid, plate-like, spaced apart locking tabs 350 (FIG. 7) are fixed to the right hand side portion of frame 62b, and a similar pair of rigid, plate-like, spaced apart locking tabs 352 (FIG. 8) are fixed to the
left hand side portion of frame 62b.  Tabs 350 and 352 extend downwardly from frame 62b as shown.  When panel 43 is assembled in place, tabs 350 removably extend downwardly between the upper horizontal portion (i.e., member 94) of frame 90 and screen
106, and tabs 352 similarly extend downwardly between the upper horizontal portion of frame 90a and the sub-assembly of frame 92a and screen 106a.
Tabs 350 are abuttable with opposed surfaces on frame 90 and the sub-assembly of frame 92 and screen 106, and tabs 350 similarly are abuttable with the opposed surfaces on frame 90a and the sub-assembly of frame 92a and screen 106a to prevent
side panels 32 and 36 from being moved laterally away from panel 43.  By preventing lateral movement of panels 32 and 36 with the interlocking tab construction just described, panel 43 cannot be freed by pushing or pulling panels 32 and 36 outwardly.
Still referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, a pair of spaced apart locking tabs 350c are fixed to the right hand side portion of frame 62c, and a further pair of spaced apart locking tabs 352c are fixed to the left hand side portion of frame 62c.  Tabs
350c and 352c are of the same construction as tabs 350 and 352, are arranged in the same manner as tabs 350 and 352, and interlock with panels 33 and 37 in the same manner as described for the sub-assembly of panels 32, 36, and 43.  Thus, tabs 350c
extend between the upper horizontal portion of frame 90b and the sub-assembly of frame 92b and screen 106b, and tabs 352c extend between frame 90c and the sub-assembly of frame 92c and screen 106c to interlock panels 33, 37 and 42 in a manner that
prevents panels 33 and 37 from being pushed or pulled laterally outwardly to thereby prevent panel 42 from being freed.
With continued reference to FIGS. 7 and 8, a pair of spaced apart locking tabs 350d are fixed to the right hand side portion of frame 62d, and a pair of spaced apart locking tabs 352d are fixed to the left hand side portion of frame 62d.  Tabs
350d and 352d are of the same construction as tabs 350 and 352, are arranged in the same manner as tabs 350 and 352, and interlock with panels 34 and 38 in the same manner as described for the sub-assembly of panels 32, 36, and 43.  Thus tabs 350d are
received between the upper horizontal portion of frame 90d and the sub-assembly of frame 92d and screen 106d, and tabs 352d are received between the upper horizontal portion of frame 90e and the sub-assembly of frame 92e and screen 106e to prevent panels
34 and 38 from being pushed or pulled laterally outwardly and away from panel 41.  Panel 41 therefore cannot be freed by laterally pushing or pulling panels 34 and 38.
Still referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, a pair of spaced apart locking tabs 350e are fixed to the right hand side portion of frame 62e, and a pair of spaced apart locking tabs 352e are fixed to the left hand side portion of frame 62e.  Tabs 350e and
352e are of the same construction as tabs 350 and 352, are arranged in the same manner as tabs 350 and 352, and interlock with panels 35 and 39 in the same manner as described for the sub-assembly of panels 32, 36, and 43.  Thus tabs 350e are received
between the upper horizontal portion of frame 90f and the sub-assembly of frame 92f and screen 106f, and tabs 352e are received between the upper horizontal portion of frame 90g and the sub-assembly of frame 92g and screen 106g to prevent panels 35 and
39 from being pushed or pulled laterally outwardly and away from panel 40.  Panel 40 therefore cannot be freed by laterally pushing or pulling panels 35 and 39.
It will be appreciated that the separable interlocks provided by tabs 350, 352, 350c, 352c, 350d, 352d, 350e, and 352e are accomplished without the use of fasteners of any kind.
When panel 43 is assembled in the previously described manner tabs 350 are slid into the space between frame 90 and the sub-assembly of frame 92 and screen 106, and tabs 352 are slid into the space between frame 90a and the sub-assembly of frame
92a and screen 106a.  The other tabs on panels 42, 41, and 40 are positioned in the same manner upon assembly of their respective panels.

Safety glass is a well-known term for a glass sandwich composed of an interlayer bonding together two glass plates or sheets which when broken results in a minimum dispersion of fragments of broken glass.  Recently it has been discovered that a
plastic material can be adhered to a single sheet of glass to make an impact-resistant bilayer and the compositions of the invention are suitable for both bilayers and the conventional trilayer safety glass laminates although the ratios may vary in which
the ingredients are reacted to form the polyester-urethanes and the thickness of the polyester-urethane may differ depending upon which type of laminate is desired.
The concept of employing a polyester-urethane as an interlayer for safety glass laminates is not new.  It has been found, however, that the compositions of the invention give superior impact-resistance, are energy absorbing such that concussive
injury is minimized when employed in a safety glass laminate and are resistant to hydrolytic and ultraviolet degradation when employed in a bilayer safety glass laminate.
The poly(butylene adipate) or poly(butylene azelate) polyester component which is employed to form the polyester-urethane of the invention is formed from butanediols preferably 1,4-butanediol; and adipic or azelaic acids to provide a molecular
weight between about 750 and about 5,000 but preferably between about 1,000 and about 3,000.  Polybutylene adipates useful in the invention having molecular weights between about 1,000 and about 2,000 are commercially available.  The butanediols reacted
with the polyester can be the 1,4- or 1,3-isomer but the particular one used will depend upon the diisocyanate and its isomer ratio.  That is, some of the diisocyanates are not compatible with 1,4-butanediol in that translucent urethanes result and for
these compositions 1,3-butanediol will be employed.  Generally, however, 1,4-butanediol will be suitable and is preferred.  Polycaprolactone, the other suitable polyester, can be formed from epsilon caprolactone by well-known procedures to provide a
polyester in the aforesaid molecular weight range.  The polyesters are hydroxyl terminated.
The diisocyanate which is employed to make the polyester-urethane is a cycloaliphatic compound and preferably a dinuclear compound bridged by an isopropylidene group or an alkylene group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms.  Among the diisocyanates which can
be employed are 4,4'-methylene-bis-(cyclohexyl diisocyanate), hydrogenated toluene diisocyanate, 4,4'-isopropylidene-bis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate), 1,4-cyclohexyl diisocyanate, 4,4'-dicyclohexyl diisocyanate, 2,2,4-trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate
(TMDI); and 3-isocyanato methyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl diisocyanate (IPDI).  Mixtures can be employed to include minor amounts of other diisocyanates, such as toluene diisocyanate, diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI) and other aromatic diisocyanates
providing that the amount employed is carefully controlled to avoid yellowing, translucence, and reduced impact resistance.
The most preferred cycloaliphatic diisocyanate is 4,4'-methylene-bis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate) and is commerically available in different stereoisomer ratios.  The product sold by duPont Company under the trademark ""Hylene W"" has a stereoisomer
content of 19 to 21 percent trans, trans, 17 to 18 percent cis, cis, and 62 to 64 percent cis, trans.  The total ratio is 55 percent trans and 45 percent cis.  The diisocyanate may also contain a minor amount of monoisocyanate such as between about 0.27
and 0.40 percent and has a total acidity (as HCl) between about 0.001 and 0.002 percent by weight and an isocyanate content of about 99.8 percent of the theoretical.  In the most preferred compositions of the invention, the diol reacted with this
diisocyanate and polyester is 1,4-butanediol.  The same diisocyanate has also been offered commercially by Allied Chemical Company as ""Nacconate H-12"" but in a different stereoisomer ratio of 70 percent total trans, and 30 percent total cis (the
proportion which is cis, cis; trans, trans and cis, trans is not known).  With this diisocyanate, the diol which is reacted with the polyester and diisocyanate should be 1,3-butanediol or other unsymmetrical or branched diol or a translucent product is
likely to result.  Thus, when the total ratio of trans to cis is high, a branched or unsymmetrical diol such as 1,3-butanediol should be employed to avoid the formation of translucent urethanes although they may have exceptional impact-resistant and
other properties necessary for superior safety glass.
In addition to the most preferred butanediols, other low molecular weight diols with molecular weights less than 250 can be employed including aliphatic diols of from 2 to 10 carbon atoms with or without ether or ester linkages as well as
cycloaliphatic diols.  Exemplary of suitable aliphatic diols are 1,2-propanediol; 2-methyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol; (2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol); 2-methylbutanediol-1,4; 2-butyl-2-ethyl-propanediol-1,3; 1,5-pentanediol; and 1,6-hexanediol. 
Exemplary of suitable diols with ether linkages are diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol and dipropylene glycol.  Exemplary of suitable cycloaliphatic diols are 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol; 1,4-cyclohexanediol;
2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol; and 4,4'-isopropylidene-bis-(cyclohexanediol).  Exemplary of suitable diols with ester linkages are hydroxypivalyl hydroxypivalate, bis-hydroxyethyl adipate and bis-hydroxypropylene adipate.
To obtain optically clear plastomers, it is generally necessary that the monomeric diol be symmetrical when the diisocyanate is low in trans, trans isomer content such as less than about 30 percent.  Exemplary of symmetrical diols are
1,4-butanediol, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, bis-hydroxyethyl adipate and bis-hydroxypropylene adipate.  Illustrative of unsymmetrical diols are 1,3-butanediol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol, 2-methyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol,
2-methylbutanediol-1,4, 2-butyl-2-ethyl-propanediol-1,3, and hydroxypivalyl hydroxypivalate.  The low molecular weight diols are preferably saturated but unsaturated diols can be employed such as 2-butene-1,4-diol.  For convenience, much of the
disclosure refers to 1,4-butanediol.  It should be understood, however, that the other monomeric diols can generally be substituted depending upon the isomer ratio of the diisocyanate.
The reactants are essentially linear and the resultant polyester-urethane is believed to be essentially linear because of its thermoplastic nature and solubility in solvents such as chloroform and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.
For interlayers having the best impact energy absorption level, it is important to form the polyurethane from proper proportions of these substituents.  Other things being substantially unchanged, it has been discovered that the best interlayer
materials are obtained when the ratio of butanediol to polyester, e.g., poly(1,4-butylene adipate) is controlled within certain limits, which limits have been observed to vary depending upon the molecular weight of the polyester.
Thus, when the polyester has a molecular weight of about 1,000 superior interlayer compositions have resulted by the use of between 0.9 and 1.2 moles of butanediol per mole of polyester.  When the ratio of butanediol to polyester exceeds about
1.2:1, loss of optimum performance in safety glass application is noted when the laminate is at a temperature of 0.degree.F.  because the interlayer is brittle.  Brittle interlayers are undesirable because there is little diaphragm action when the
laminate is ruptured thereby increasing the likelihood of concussive, lacerative, and penetration injury.  Within the aforesaid ratios, however, the compositions are superior to all known interlayer compositions as the penetration resistance is superior
over a broad temperature range of from 0.degree.F.  to 120.degree.F.  Heretofore, it has been only possible to prepare laminates which were effective at a particular temperature and when variations were made to improve another temperature, the properties
of a laminate at the first temperature suffered.
Quite surprisingly, it has been found that when the polyester has a molecular weight of 2,000, the ratio of ingredients can be considerably expanded and superior compositions still prepared.  For example, the ratio of butanediol to polyester of
2,000 molecular weight can be between about 0.7:1 and about 5:1 and the laminate has superior properties across a wide temperature range.
To prepare a transparent polyester-urethane suitable for use in automobile wind-shields, it is necessary that the urethane reactants be made homogeneous and reacted at a temperature above about 100.degree.C, or preferably above about
120.degree.C.  In some cases, however, additional steps are necessary in order to obtain haze free interlayer polymers.  For example, some compositions made from high molecular weight polyesters such as 4,000 molecular weight poly(1,4-butylene adipate)
are translucent unless the reaction rate of the reactants is controlled to obtain a more random distribution of blocks of diisocyanate-polyester, and diisocyanate-diol having a molecular weight less than 250, such as by use of a catalyst or by mixing
and/or conducting the reaction at a higher temperature.  One method to clarify these polymers is to heat the polymer to a temperature between about 320.degree.F.  and about 375.degree.F.  such as by extrusion and then quench it in water, although in some
cases the polymer may revert to its translucent state upon aging.  As previously noted, the urethane may also become translucent because of the use of a diisocyanate having a high amount (70%) trans isomer but this can be compensated for by using the
unsymmetrical 1,3-butanediol.
It is also important to rapidly obtain reaction temperatures after a homogenous mixture is obtained when a catalyst is not employed so that the polymer does not become hazy.  For example, it has been found that when poly(1,4-butylene adipate),
1,4-butanediol, and 4,4'-methylene-bis-(cyclohexyl diisocyanate) ""Hylene W"" are employed in the mole ratio of Example 3, infra, the mixture becomes hazy after about 103 minutes at a temperature of 65.degree.C.  When the temperature is raised to
80.degree.C., however, the mixture becomes hazy after about 47 minutes and when the temperature is further raised to 100.degree.C., after a twenty minute heating period from 57.degree.C., the mixture is hazy after only sixteen minutes at 100.degree.C. 
Thus, it is important either through the use of a catalyst or by introducing the reactants at the reaction temperature such as by use of a mixing head, to rapidly reach the reaction temperature such as above about 120.degree.C.  so that the polymer does
not become hazy.
The urethane ingredients are preferably mixed in a moisture-free atmosphere such as nitrogen to prevent moisture contamination.  When the reaction is conducted without a catalyst, an oxygen-free atmosphere is also preferably employed to prevent
any surface discoloration of the urethane.
The urethanes are preferably prepared by the one-step bulk polymerization method which provides a flexible polymer having a more random distribution of segments.  The total number of hydroxyl groups or labile hydrogen atoms is equivalent to the
number of isocyanate groups although a slight deficiency of hydroxyl groups or NCO groups can be employed to provide an NCO to OH ratio of 0.99 to 1.01.
The reaction is preferably conducted until the polymer formation is essentially complete and the product is substantially free of unreacted isocyanate groups, i.e., has less than 0.3 percent by weight isocyanate groups and preferably less than
about 0.08 percent by weight isocyanate groups.  The polyester and butanediol should not have a water content higher than about 0.2 percent, preferably less than 0.05.
To obtain the randomness desired and a clear leathery polymer, the butanediol is preferably added to the polyester under a nitrogen atmosphere to exclude moisture and the temperature maintained sufficiently high so that there is no phase
separation and a homogeneous mixture is obtained.  The diisocyanate is then preferably added rapidly and the temperature of the mixture maintained sufficiently high to obtain a homogeneous mixture so that there is no phase separation.
The mixture is then preferably degassed with agitation for a period, for example, of about 3 minutes during which time the pressure is reduced from atmospheric to about 3 millimeters of mercury.  The reduction in pressure facilitates the removal
of the dissolved gases such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide and then the ingredients are preferably reacted at a temperature of between about 120.degree.  and 150.degree.C.  (e.g., 143.degree.C) if in the pressure of a catalyst and the reaction continued
for about 4 hours until there are substantially no isocyanate groups.  In lieu of a catalyst, the reaction can be conducted for about 20 hours preferably under a nitrogen atmosphere.  The resultant semi-solid polymer is then preferably cut while warm,
granulated, extruded and/or milled and calendered into sheets and assembled into laminates.
Polymers having the desired random distribution can also be prepared by the pre-polymer method whereby the polyester is first treated with the diisocyanate and the butanediol is then reacted with the pre-polymer.
If desired, a minor portion of the polyester can be replaced by other polymeric components providing that their use does not result in decreased performance of the resultant laminate.  Exemplary of suitable polymers are polyethers such as the
poly(oxy-polymethylene) glycols, such as disclosed in Wismer, U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,509,015, and the hydroxy-terminated polycarbonates as disclosed in Stevens, U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  3,248,414; 3,248,415; and 3,248,416.  Other polyols can also be employed.
After the reaction is substantially complete, the polymer is preferably transferred directly to an extruder and extruded, and/or milled and calendered to the desired thickness or the partially polymerized material can be further polymerized in
the forming equipment.  When it is not possible to make a direct transfer from the reaction apparatus to the forming apparatus, the polyurethane material can be poured into trays and the like and allowed to harden into blocks.  The trays are preferably
coated with a suitable coating so that the polymer does not adhere to the tray or removal is sometimes difficult.  Suitable coating materials are halogenated hydrocarbons such as Teflon, or a sheet material such as Tedlar can be draped in the tray. 
Conventional granulators, rubber mills and extruders can be employed to form the polymer into sheet form.  The material is then preferably sandwiched between a non-adherent protective material such as polyethylene to exclude dust and preferably sealed in
a container to exclude moisture.  It may be desirable to coat the polymer with a powder such as sodium bicarbonate in order to prevent adjacent sheets from adhering to each other.  Before use in a laminate it is desirable to control the moisture content
in the polymer such as by drying in an oven at a temperature between about room temperature and about 120.degree.F.  for from a few hours up to 3 days or more.  Before lamination the powder, if employed, can be removed by a water bath and the sheet
dried.  The polyurethane can then be placed with other materials to form the desired laminate.  In some cases, an adhesion promoter or inhibitor may be necessary so that the polyurethane adheres to the glass to prevent the scattering or flying of glass
pieces when the laminate is ruptured but which does not adhere so tightly that diaphragm action is not obtained when the laminate is ruptured.  Suitable adhesion promoters are the alkoxy silanes which include gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (sold by
Union Carbide Corporation under the trademark ""A-1100"") and N-(beta-aminoethyl)gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (sold by Union Carbide Corporation under the trademark ""A-1120"").  The promoter may be incorporated into the urethane reactants, applied
externally to the sheet material or applied to the glass surface.  Exemplary of suitable adhesion inhibitors are the alkyl acid phosphates disclosed in Canadian Pat.  No. 861,469.  Particularly preferred is stearyl acid phosphate.  Only a minor amount of
adhesion controlling agent is required, if at all, such as from about 0.00001 to to about 0.1 percent.
After the desired plies have been assembled, air can be removed and the laminate edges sealed by placing a rubber dam or channel around the edges of the laminate, and pulling a partial vacuum and heating the laminate to the polyurethane softening
temperature.  Sealing can be accomplished in from between about 5 to 10 minutes at a temperature of 300.degree.F.  and pressure of 10-25 p.s.i.g.  The laminate can then be placed in an oil or an air autoclave until the laminate is sealed at a temperature
between about 275.degree.  and 350.degree.F.  for a period between about 45 minutes and 2 hours at 50 to 250 p.s.i.g.  The autoclave conditions, however, will depend upon the particular polymers employed.  In lieu of edge sealing and/or when the
polyurethane is adhered to a single layer of glass and thus will be exposed to the oil in the autoclave, the laminate can be placed in a heat-resistant, heat-sealable bag such as a polyethylene coated Mylar bag sold under the trademark ""Polymar"".  The
air can then be removed by pulling the vacuum which seals the bag and the edge sealing step eliminated.
A method for preparing trilayer and bilayer laminates useful herein is disclosed in Seeger et al., U.S.  Ser.  No. 242,347, filed Apr.  10, 1972, pages 39 through 46.
Conventional glass can be employed but preferably the glass is a chemically strengthened or thermally tempered glass. The following examples serve to illustrate the invention and its preferred embodiments.  All parts and percentages in
said examples and elsewhere in the specification and claims are by weight unless otherwise indicated.
The compositions of Examples 1 and 2 were prepared and formulated into laminates by the following procedure.  A glass kettle was employed, generally 2 liters, fitted with magnetic stirrer, a heating mantle, thermometer, a conduit for reducing the
pressure in the kettle and also for introducing nitrogen and an emergency conduit for bleeding air through a drying tube.  The polyester was charged to the kettle and heated to a mixing temperature of 160.degree.  to 165.degree.F.  This mixing
temperature was maintained for approximately 1 hour under a reduced pressure of 2 of 3 millimeters of mercury.  The low molecular weight diol and diisocyanate were heated in separate containers to the aforesaid mix temperature under a reduced pressure of
2 to 3 millimeters of mercury.  The vacuum was broken with the addition of nitrogen and the low molecular weight diol (i.e., less than 250) added to the glass kettle and the pressure reduced to between 2 to 3 millimeters of mercury whereupon the mix
temperature of 160.degree.  to 165.degree.  F. was maintained from 5 to 10 minutes.  The diisocyanate was then removed from the oven and added to the glass kettle by the same procedure of the low molecular weight diol and for an additional 5 to 6 minutes
the aforesaid mix temperature was maintained.  The mixture was then cast into pre-heated glass cells which were pre-heated to a cure temperature of 290.degree.F.  and the cells put back in an oven for 24 hours and maintained at 290.degree.F.  The cells
were prepared by sealing three edges of a 1/8th inch by 12 inch sheet of glass with a silicone gasket or pressure-sensitive spacer tape such as polyvinylchloride with adhesive on each side and this sheet adhered to a similar sheet of glass, and tape
applied to three outer edges of said combined sheets whereby s 30 mil space is obtained between the sheets, and three of the four outside edges are sealed.  An aluminum tape with adhesive on one side was used to make a dam on the other edge of the glass
through which the hot polymer reactants could be poured.  The cell was tilted at an angle of 20.degree.  to 30.degree.  to permit the flow of reactants mix while pushing the air out of the cell and the mixture was poured into the cell and placed in an
oven at the same angle.  When the polyurethane was cured (e.g., 24 hours at 143.degree.C.) such as determined by the disappearance of the NCO band as evidenced by attentuated total reflectance (infra red spectrophotometry) the laminate of a cell was aged
for a week at room temperature and then subjected to an impact test.  By this test, a 5 pound steel ball is dropped on to the laminate, while held rigid in a frame, from a heighth which ensures it will penetrate the laminate.  By an electronic device, a
time-distance reltionship (velocity) is obtained for the ball as it penetrates the laminate; and this data along with knowing the drop heighth permits calculation of the penetration velocity.  Several tests were conducted at each temperature and the mean
penetration velocity given is the average value obtained from a number of tests, when a single value is given.
EXAMPLE 1
Polyester-urethanes were prepared employing either poly(1,4-butylene azelate) or poly(ethylene adipate) as the polyester with varying low molecular diols and the Hylene W diisocyanate.  The ingredients, their mole ratio and the ball drop results
are given in the following Table I. All compounds were formulated to provide a urethane content of 15.5 percent and three laminates were tested at 0.degree.F.  and 120.degree.F.  and two laminates at 70.degree.F.  The urethane concentration can be
determined by the following formula based upon 1 mole of polyester polyol and an NCO:OH ratio of 1: ##EQU1## where Wu = weight percent of urethane group.  From the results reported in Table I, it can be seen that all of the laminates employing
polyethylene adipate as the polyester were brittle 0.degree.F.  indicating that the laminate had little or no impact-absorbing properties at this temperature.  Compounds I-A, 1-B, 1-C and 1-D, however, all prepared from poly(1,4-butylene azelate) are
effective at all three temperatures.  Compound 1-B, however, also employing 1,4-butanediol as the low molecular weight diol is superior as it shows the same high impact-absorbing properties at all three temperatures.

EXAMPLE 2
Another series of polyester-urethane was prepared and tested in which varying polyesters were used with the preferred low molecular weight diol, 1,4-butanediol and the preferred diisocyanate, Hylene w. The formulations are given in the following
Table II which compositions were formulated to provide a urethane content of 15.5 percent in each polyurethane.  The impact resistance data is presented in Table III.  From the data, it can be seen that the compounds of the invention 2-A, 2-B and 2-K are

The following Examples are illustrative of polyester-urethanes which were prepared into sheet form by the preferred procedure.
EXAMPLE 3
A poly(1,4-butylene adipate) polyester (785.6 grams, 0.400 mole) having a molecular weight of 1965, a hydroxyl number of 57 and a melting point of 40.degree.  to 60.degree.C.  and an acid number of 0.5; and a poly(1,4-butylene adipate) polyester
(707.4 grams, 0.698 mole) having a molecular weight of 1014, a hydroxyl number of 111 and an acid number of 0.5 were dried together with agitation in a glass reactor to remove trace amounts of water by heating to 100.degree.-105.degree.C.  under 3
millimeters of mercury pressure for about 3 hours.  The pressure was released while introducing pre-purified nitrogen and anhydrous 1,4-butanediol, 260.6 grams, (2.892 moles, 0.03% H.sub.2 O) was added over a one minute period to the agitated mixture of
dried polyesters at 93.degree.C., and the mixture heated to 95.degree.C.  in 15 minutes.  The resulting mixture was homogeneous.  To this homogeneous mixture was added over a one minute period 1046.8 grams (3.989 moles) Hylene W.
4,4'-methylene-bis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate) with a stereoisomer content of 19 to 21 percent trans, trans, 17 to 18 percent cis, cis, and 62 to 64 percent cis, trans, said diisocyanate containing between 0.27 percent and 0.40 percent monoisocyanate, and
0.280 gram (0.01 percent of the total reactants) of dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst.  The quantity of diisocyanate was sufficient to provide a urethane content of 16.81 percent in the resultant polymer.  The butanediol and diisocyanate were at 22.degree.C. and the additions were both made while the reactor was under a nitrogen atmosphere.  The resulting mixture was rapidly agitated for about one minute during which time the temperature of the mixture rose from 80.degree.C.  to 95.degree.  C. The mixture
was poured into a dry Teflon coated reactor which was closed and placed in a 130.degree.C.  non-circulating oven continuously purged with nitrogen (the temperature of the polymer was approximately 143.degree.C.) for about 2 hours until the reaction and
polyurethane formation was substantially complete.  The NCO content of the polymer was 0.07 percent by weight as determined by infrared spectrometry.  The resultant semi-solid polymer was allowed to cool to room temperature, removed, cut and milled
(front roll 180.degree.F.  and rear roll 135.degree.F.) and calendered on a 3 roll mill (top roll 250.degree.F., middle roll 225.degree.;.  and bottom roll 215.degree.F.) into 35 mil sheets 14 inches in width.  The polymer had an inherent viscosity at
30.degree.C.  at a 0.5 percent concentration in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone of about 1.40 before milling and an NCO content of 0.07 percent.  The inherent viscosity after calendering was approximately the same (1.41).
EXAMPLE 4
In accordance with the general procedure and conditions of Example 1, a poly(1,4-butylene adipate) polyester (2.274 moles) having a molecular weight of 1010 and a hydroxyl number of 111.1 was mixed with a poly(1,4-butylene adipate) (1.295 moles)
having a molecular weight of 1965 and a hydroxy number of 57.1 to which agitated mixture of dried polyester was added first 7.23 moles of 1,4-butanediol and then 9.99 moles of 4,4'-methylene-bis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate) (Hylene W) and the mixture was
heated to 80.degree.C.  The quantity of diisocyanate was sufficient to provide a urethane content of 16.81 percent in the resultant polymer.  No catalyst, however, was added and the homogeneous mass was heated at an oven temperature between about
122.degree.  and 129.degree.C.  for 19 hours.  The resultant polymer had an inherent viscosity at 30.degree.C.  at a 0.5 percent concentration in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone of about 0.79, and an NCO content of 0.1 percent by weight.  The inherent viscosity
remained unchanged after calendering.  The front roll temperature of the mill was 180.degree.F.  and the rear roll 135.degree.F.  The top roll of the calender was 150.degree.F., the middle roll 135.degree.F., and the bottom roll 125.degree.F.
In Examples 5 through 27, the polyurethanes were prepared from the specified materials in the indicated molar ratio following the general procedure and conditions of Example 3 except no catalyst was used and in Examples 24 through 27 the
diisocyanate which was added was at a temperature of about 60.degree.C.  The water content reported in Examples 24 through 27 is the amount of water in the combined hydroxyl terminated reactants.  Inherent viscosities of the prepared polyurethanes were
taken at 30.degree.C.  at a 0.5 percent concentration in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone for Examples 5 through 12 and in silica stabilized chloroform, for examples 13 through 27.  The NCO content was determined by infrared spectrometry.

It can be seen from the data that the preferred compositions have a relatively constant modulus in the leathery region at various temperatures, whereas the polyvinyl butryal composition is out of the leathery region at both -20.degree.  and
50.degree.C.  and is not relatively constant at the other two intermediate temperatures.
The Example compositions meet the minimum light transmittance and haze requirements of the automobile code (ANSI Code Z-261 1966 Test No. 18).
Safety glass laminates were prepared employing as interlayers the compositions of Examples 3-27 and a commercial polyvinyl butyral polymer.  The laminates which measured 12 inches by 12 inches employed glass sheets having a thickness of 1/8-inch
and were formed by placing the interlayers (30 - 46 mils) between two glass sheets and the laminates subjected to a temperature of 275.degree.-350.degree.F.  and 200 p.s.i.  for 45 minutes in an autoclave.  Laminates were aged for one week at room
temperature and then subjected to the impact resistance test as described supra.  The test results are shown in the following Table IV:

From the Table, it can be seen that the compositions of the invention can be used effectively as interlayers.  They are effective over a broad temperature range and are generally superior to the commercial polyvinyl butyral interlayer.  Further,
it can be seen by varying the concentration of the reactants that a composition can be prepared for a particular use and temperature.
In order to test for laceration severity, sled tests were conducted [see, for example, ""Eleventh STAPP Car Crash Conference"" proceeding published by the Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc., New York, New York (1967, page 143)]. These tests
consist of propelling a dummy of average weight (having a head covered with a double layer of moist chamois) at various speeds into a laminated safety glass maintained at various temperatures, and the extent of chamois tear after impact noted.  The
windshields are mounted in a frame at an angle of 70.degree.  using adhesive glazing similar to most domestic commercial production mountings.  A laceration rating is assigned by the following method.  Surface lacerations to the outer layer of the
chamois only are classed as ""minor"" and giving an injury rating of 1.  Deep lacerations through both layers of the chamois are considered as ""serious"" and given an injury rating of 5.  Intermediate degrees of damage to the chamois are rated 2, 3 or 4,
depending upon the severity of damage.
A factor known as the Severity Index has become identified with relative safety of the windshields determined by impact tests using the 50th percentile Alderson dummy covered with two layers of moist chamois on the test sled apparatus.  The
Severity Index (S.I.) is calculated by the formula:
where A is deceleration in units of gravity and dt is the time differential in milliseconds between the moment of impact of the head of the dummy with the test windshield to the time a horizontal accelerometer mounted within the dummy head
indicates a sudden negative load.  This value is determined for each millisecond during the time interval and the values integrated for the whole time period.  In other words, the Severity Index is calculated from the area under a curve resulting from a
plot of acceleration acting on the dummy head raised to the .sup.2.5 power as a function of time.  In general, the Severity Index increases with velocity of impact.
The test results for the windshields employing a composition prepared by the procedure of Example 17 and the commercial polyvinyl butyral composition as the interlayers are shown in Table V. The interlayers were approximately 30 mils thick and
the float glass 1/8 inch.  The windshields were heated in an autoclave for 45 minutes at 275.degree.F.  and 200 p.s.i.g.
The preferred polyurethanes provide windshields with severity indices less than 1,000 when the windshield is not penetrated by the dummy and an inner glass sheet is impacted at a velocity of 25 miles per hour by the Alderson dummy of average
weight (162-165 lbs.) while the windshield is maintained at a temperature of 30.degree., 75.degree.  or 110.degree.F.  and the total length of polyurethane tear is less than about 5 inches, and the laceration rating not more than 3.

From the data reported in the Table, it can be seen that the composition of the invention is effective over a wide temperature range and is superior to the PVB interlayer at high impact velocities as evidenced by the low laceration ratings,
limited amount of interlayer tear and low severity indices.  The low severity indices for PVB are meaningless in view of the extensive interlayer tear.  In addition to the reported data, the composition of the invention stretched to a considerable extent
absorbing energy so as to prevent or minimize concussion injury, and also adhered well to the glass inhibiting scattering of broken glass particles.
The following Examples are illustrative of bilayer laminates wherein the composition of the invention is adhered to a single layer of glass.
EXAMPLES 28-30
Three polyurethanes prepared by the procedure and proportions of Example 3 except that no catalyst was used, were sandwiched between two glass sheets (annealed float glass or thermally tempered plate glass as indicated) one of which glass sheets
was covered on the interface with a release material of 1-mil thick TEDLAR film and the other was treated on the interface with an adhesion promoter of 1 percent solution by weight N-(beta amino ethyl) gamma amino propyltrimethoxysilane in isopropyl
alcohol and water.  The solvent solution was prepared from 250 milliliters of isopropanol and 195 milliliters water from which a 99 gram portion was taken and mixed with 1 gram of silane.  A portion of this adhesion promoter was then sprayed on the glass
sheet and allowed to air dry at room temperature.  The sandwich was then subjected to a temperature between 275.degree.F.  and 350.degree.F.  at 200 pounds per square inch pressure for 45 minutes in an autoclave.  The laminates were then subjected to a
22 lb.  headform dropped on the plastic side and the results are shown in the following Table VI.

The poly(urethanes) of the invention have excellent optical properties and are clear and exhibit excellent transmission to visible light.  They generally have inherent viscosities at 30.degree.C.  in 0.5 percent solution of silica stabilized
chloroform or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone of between about 0.8 and about 1.6.
In addition, the poly(ester-urethanes) can be characterized by their urethane (HNCOO) concentration.  Polyurethanes for this invention will generally have a urethane content between about 13 and about 16, preferably between 13.5 and 15.5 percent
by weight with polyols having a molecular weight of 1,000, and between about 12 and about 18, preferably between 13.5 and 17 percent by weight with an optimum of about 13.71 percent by weight for the polyols of 2,000 molecular weight.
The urethanes of the invention can be characterized as thermoplastic or plastomers, that is, they are elastoplastic and thus do not snap back as a true elastomer when stressed.  In addition, they are clear, flexible and essentially non-adhesive
at room temperature.  They can also be described as being leathery and generally have a relatively constant Gehman modulus between about -20.degree.  and 50.degree.C.  of 10.sup.7 and 10.sup.9.5, log of 3 times the shear modulus in dynes per cm..sup.2,
as measured according to ASTM-D 1053-65.
The polyurethanes of the invention will generally have an average molecular weight as calculated from inherent viscosity measurements between about 10,000 and about 100,000 and preferably between about 20,000 and 65,000.  In addition, the
optically clear polyurethanes upon heating will generally exhibit a low temperature endotherm at about 70.degree.C.  (differential thermal analysis can be made with a duPont 900 Thermal Analyzer) and generally no endotherm or exotherm occurs between
100.degree.  and 170.degree.C.  indicating that the polymer is amorphous.  Softening points of about 170.degree.C., melting points of about 220.degree.C.  and decomposition at about 270.degree.C.  are typical.  The compositions are suitable for use in
automobile windshields and meet the standard requirements of minimum light transmission of 70 percent and preferably 86.5 percent or above (Illuminant A, Tungsten Lamp 2,840.degree.  K) and less than 2 percent haze on an abraded specimen (ANSI Code
Z-26.1, 1966, Test No. 18).  The percent light transmission and percent haze can be measured by the Hunter Pivotable Haze Meter.
It is believed that the polyester-urethanes of the invention have segments principally of (ACBC).sub.x wherein A is the polyester, B is the low molecular weight diol of less than 250, C is the cycloaliphatic diisocyanate and x is an integer. 
There is believed to be a small number of BC segments which are joined together to provide hard segments, and there is believed to be a smaller number of AC segments.  When the preferred ratio of reactants is employed of 0.9 to 1.2 moles of low molecular
weight diol per mole of 1,000 MW polyester, the number of BC and AC units should be about equal.  When the preferred ratio of reactants are employed of 0.7 to 5 moles of low molecular weight diol per mole of 2,000 MW polyester, then the number of BC
units is 0.7 to 5 times as great as the number of AC units.
In addition, the trans, trans stereoisomer of the diisocyanate is more reactive with the aforesaid hydroxyl-terminated reactants than the cis, trans or cis, cis isomers and consequently blocks from the same isocyanate stereoisomer may appear in
the AC and BC segments.
Further, hydrogen bonding is believed to occur between the hydrogen atoms of the urethane groups and the carbonyl groups of the urethane group in another molecule, or the carbonyl groups of the polyester.  This is believed to impart desirable
strength to the polyester-urethane but because the hydrogen bonds are believed to be broken at elevated temperature, the polyester-urethanes of the invention are easily processible.  When allowed to return to ambient temperature, the bonds are believed
to be reformed so as to again impart strength or impact resistance to the plastomeric polyester-urethane.
It is believed that if too many BC segments are joined together, a translucent polymer results.  This may occur when a prepolymer is formed of the diisocyanate and low molecular weight diol, and the prepolymer reacted with a polyester.
When used in the appended claims, the use of the term ""transparent"" in connection with polyester-urethane refers to a polyester-urethane glass laminate having a minimum light transmission of 70 percent and less than 2 percent haze on an abraded
specimen as determined by A.N.S.I.  Code Z 26.1, 1966, Test No. 18, when the urethane is sandwiched between two glass sheets.
Mean penetration velocity as used in the appended claims is the average velocity at which a 5 pound free-falling 31/4 -inch diameter steel ball will just pass through a laminate made up of a polyester-urethane interlayer sandwiched between two
sheets of 1/8 th inch thick 12-inch by 12-inch float glass to form a laminate with the laminate held rigid, the polyester-urethane sheet approximately 0.030 inch thick and the laminate maintained at a temperature of 0.degree.F., 70.degree.F., or
120.degree.F.  The term ""sheet"" encompasses not only pre-formed polyurethane but also cast-in-place or a polyurethane layer achieved by any means.
Although the present invention has been described with reference to the specific details of particular embodiments thereof, it is not intended thereby to limit the scope of the invention, except insofar as the specific details are recited in the
appended claims.

",,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1.  Field of the Invention
The invention relates to containers, especially those used for the handling of plastic or other refuse bags.
2.  Description of the Prior Art
Representative of the pertinent prior art are Isaac U.S.  Pat.  No. 2,572,486 and Herman U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,218,090.  Among the disadvantages of such constructions is the fact that the plastic refuse bags must be lifted a considerable distance to
remove them from the container.  A further drawback of these prior constructions is the fact that the lid is either entirely separable from the container and thus inconvenient to handle and subject to damage, or is secured to the container in a manner
which requires additional outside clearance.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel and improved container for refuse bags which obviates difficulties attendant upon prior constructions and has a lid not subject to damage and requiring no additional outside clearance.
It is another object to provide a wheeled container of this type which is easily manufactured and has a low and neat outside appearance.
It is a further object to provide an improved refuse container of this nature which can accommodate a plurality of filled plastic refuse bags and from which the bags can be easily removed with a minimum of lifting.
It is also an object to provide an improved container of this character which by its inherent construction has a high degree of rain protection.
Briefly, each illustrated embodiment of the container comprises a flat, rectangular bottom, a semi-cylindrical cover having a stationary portion extending upwardly and curved over the bottom, and a curved lid portion movable between a closed
position and an open position overlapping the stationary portion, and a pair of end walls having straight lower edges and curved upper edges conforming to the cover.  In one embodiment a pair of tracks are secured to the inner surfaces of said end walls
for guiding and supporting the lid portion when moved between its positions. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

FIG. 6 is a front elevational view of a second embodiment of the container; and
FIG. 7 is a side cross-sectional view taken along the line 7--7 of FIG. 6. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
Referring first to the embodiment of FIGS. 1 to 5, the wheeled container generally indicated at 11 comprises a rectangular bottom 12, a curved cover generally indicated at 13, and a pair of end walls 14 and 15 having straight bottoms and curved
upper edges to conform to the shape of the cover.  The container is shown as having a downwardly and forwardly extending fork 16 secured to the underside of the bottom at one end thereof and carrying a wheel 17.  A pair of fixed legs 18 and 19 extend
downwardly from opposite corners at the other end of the bottom so that the latter will be level when the legs rest on the ground.
Cover 13 comprises a stationary portion 21 and a lid portion 22, as seen in FIG. 3.  Stationary portion 21 has a vertical section extending upwardly from the rear edge of bottom 12 and bending into a curved portion which partially envelopes the
container.  The outer edge 23 of stationary cover portion 21 is a substantial distance past the central plane of the container so that this section of the stationary cover portion has a downward slope.  The height of cover 13 and the length of the
container are such as to accommodate several filled plastic refuse bags of ordinary size.  A pair of side flanges 24 and 25 extend from edge 23 of cover portion 21 along side walls 14 and 15 respectively, terminating at the bottoms of the end walls.
Lid portion 22 has an upper section curved similarly to the curved portion of stationary cover portion 21 and a flatter lower portion.  In its closed position as shown in FIG. 3, the lower edge 26 of lid portion 22 is closely adjacent bottom 12. 
If desired, a short upwardly extending sill 27 may be provided along the adjacent edge of bottom 12, disposed inwardly of the lower edge of the lid portion.
The extent of lid portion 22 is such that a substantial area of its curved section underlies stationary cover portion 21, as seen in FIG. 3, thus inhibiting the entry of rain water.  Means are provided for both supporting and guiding the movement
of lid portion 22 between its open and closed positions.  This means is in the form of a pair of flanges 28 and 29 extending inwardly from end walls 14 and 15 respectively (FIG. 4).  These flanges are spaced inwardly from and extend parallel to
stationary cover portion 21 and continued past edge 23 of the stationary cover portion.  As they approach sill 27, these flanges are somewhat closer to the edges of end walls 14 and 15 and overlap the corners of sill 27.  It will be observed in FIG. 5
that the side edges of lid portion 22 are supported along almost their entire length by flanges 28 and 29 thus adding to the sturdiness of the device.
The end 31 of lid portion 22 beneath fixed cover portion 21 supports a pair of rollers 32 and 33 which are confined between fixed cover portion 21 and guides 28 and 29 respectively, as seen in FIG. 4.  A handle 34 is provided on lid portion 22
for moving it between open and closed positions.  A lifting handle 35 is also secured to the outer surface of end wall 15 for wheeling the container.
In use, handle 34 will be grasped and lid portion 22 slid back under fixed cover portion 21 to approximately the dot-dash line position of FIG. 3.  This will expose the interior of the container, permitting a large access area for loading with
plastic refuse bags.  The movement of lid portion 22 will be smooth as facilitated by guides 28 and 29 and rollers 32 and 33.  After loading, lid portion 22 may be closed by again grasping handle 34 and sliding the lid downwardly.  The forward portions
of guides 28 and 29 will guide and support the lid which will overlap sill 27 for additional rain protection.
After one or more bags have been loaded into the container, it may be wheeled toward the pickup area by grasping and lifting handle 35.  The container may either be left at the pickup site so that the refuse collectors may open the lid, remove
the refuse bags and reclose the lid, or the householder may remove the refuse bags himself at the pickup point and return the container.
During time intervals between refuse pickups, empty or partially filled plastic bags may be kept in the container and additional refuse added thereto from time to time.  This may be easily accomplished since there is wide access to the refuse
bags when lid portion 22 is opened.
FIGS. 6 and 7 show a second embodiment of the invention which is basically similar to the first embodiment and is generally indicated at 101.  The container has a bottom 102 of rectangular shape and a cover generally indicated at 103 having a
fixed portion 104 extending upwardly from the rear edge 105 of the bottom and curving around over the top thereof, the upper edge 106 of the fixed portion being located past the center plane of the container.  The lid portion 107 of the cover has a
curved shape similar to that of the fixed cover portion and is movable between open and closed positions.  In its closed position the lid portion has an upper section 108 overlapping a section 109 of the fixed cover portion and a lower edge 111 closely
adjacent the forward edge 112 of the container bottom.
The container has a pair of end walls 113 and 114 having straight lower edges connected to bottom 102 and curved upper edges 115 connected to the fixed cover portion and extending forwardly and downwardly toward the forward edge of the container
bottom.  A sill 116 extends upwardly from the forward edge 112 of the bottom.
Lid portion 107 of the cover is pivotally connected at 117 and 118 to end walls 113 and 114 respectively.  Thus, the lid portion is swingable between the closed position shown in solid lines in FIG. 7 and an open position shown in dot-dash lines. The pivots are connected to end walls 119 and 121 of lid portion 107, the end walls being of generally quadrant shape.
As in the previous embodiment, the container when in its closed position will have a substantial degree of rain protection, since the lower edge 111 of lid portion 107 overlaps sill 116 and the upper portion 108 overlaps fixed cover portion 109. 
In the open position of the lid portion, free access may be had to the interior of the container for the handling of refuse bags.
If desired, spring means (not shown) could be provided in either embodiment of the container for constantly urging the lid portion toward its closed position, so that refuse will not inadvertently be left exposed.  Instead of the lid portion
being movable by hand, it could be pedal-operated to its open position, thus enabling a user who is carrying refuse bags in both hands to place them in the container without having to put them down.

This invention relates to a divider or partitioning member which is placed between the front and back seats of a motor vehicle and which serves to reduce the area of heating and cooling within the occupant compartment of the vehicle.
The divider of this invention includes upper and lower portions which are interconnected by hinge means.  The upper portion of the divider is secured to the interior of the occupant compartment of the vehicle over the back rest of the vehicle's
front seat.  The lower portion of the divider is shiftable about its hinge means between a closed position in which it is generally aligned with the upper interconnected portion of the divider to form an isolating partition between the upper edge of the
front seat and the vehicle roof and an open position in which it provides an open space between the upper edge of the front seat of the vehicle and the roof thereof so as to allow for air flow, such as during cooling and heating, and conversation to pass
between the front and rear seats of the vehicle.
It is an object of this invention to provide a divider for use in the occupant compartment of a vehicle which separates the occupant compartment into two sections at the front seat of the vehicle.
Another object of this invention is to provide a divider or partition having open and closed positions which when in its closed position isolates the front seat portion of the occupant compartment of the vehicle from the back seat portion
thereof.
Still another object of this invention is to provide a divider for the occupant compartment of a vehicle by which air conditioning and heating within the vehicle is restricted to the front seat area thereof.
Other objects of this invention will become apparent upon a reading of the invention's description. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

The preferred embodiments illustrated are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.  They are chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its application and
practical use to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention.
In FIG. 1, a motor vehicle 10 is shown.  Vehicle 10 includes an occupant compartment 12, partially enclosed by a roof 14 and spaced sides 16.  A front seat 18 and a back seat 20 are located within compartment 12.  Front seat 18 includes a back
rest 22 which carries head rests 24.
The divider 26 of this invention includes an upper portion 28 and a lower portion 30, each of which is preferably planar.  Lower portion 30 is hinged to upper portion 28 so as to be shiftable relative to the upper portion of the divider.  The
manner of hinging lower portion 30 to upper portion 28 of the divider may vary.  In FIGS. 1-6, the lower portion 30 is hinged to upper portion 28 by means of hinge brackets 32.  In FIG. 8 the hinge 32' is molded onto portions 28 and 30 as an integral
part of the divider.  In FIG. 7 the upper divider portion 28 is formed of a relatively stiff material and the lower divider portion 30 is formed of a flexible material so as to form a bend or hinge 32"" just below where portion 30 joins portion 28.  Upper
and lower portions 28 and 30 may be formed of a variety of materials, such as fiberglass or plastic.  In the case of a plastic it is preferable that the material be transparent so as not to reduce the rear vision of the driver of the vehicle or reduce
the forward vision of any passengers riding in vehicle back seat 20.
Portions 28 and 30 of the divider extend transversely of the vehicle from one side 16 to the other side 16 thereof.  Upper portion 28 has its upper edge 36 preferably formed on a curvature which conforms to the transverse inner surface of the
vehicle roof 14 above back rest 22 of front seat 18 of the vehicle.  A pair of brackets 38 are utilized to secure divider 26 at its upper portion 28 to the vehicle.  Brackets 38 include a flange part 40 and a channel part 42.  Each bracket 38 is mounted
at its flange part 40 to the vehicle center post 44 or similar accessible location in general alignment with back rest 22 of front seat 18 of the vehicle.  Channel parts 42 of brackets 38 are oppositely positioned and extend into the interior of the
vehicle.  Ends 46 of upper portions 28 of the divider fit into bracket channel parts 42 with upper edge 36 of portion 28 being positioned closely adjacent and following the inner surface of roof 14.  With upper portion 28 of the divider so supported
within occupant compartment 12 of the vehicle by brackets 28, lower portion 30 of the divider is shiftable about hinge brackets 32 from a closed position, such as that illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 in which the lower divider portion extends to the
upper edge of back rest 22 of vehicle front seat 18, and an open position, such as that illustrated in FIG. 4 in which the lower divider portion is swung rearwardly relatively to the vehicle, to provide an opening between the lower edge of divider
portion 28 and the front seat of the vehicle.
The outer edges of the lower divider portion are notched or cut away so as to accommodate brackets 38.  Each lower outer edge of lower divider portion 30 is provided with an eyelet 47 by which the lower divider portion when swung into its open
position can be connected to the clothes hook 48 usually provided within the interior of the vehicle occupant compartment.  If no clothes hook is available, a suitable hook can be provided and secured to the frame adjacent the roof of the vehicle.  Lower
divider portion 30 remains in its closed position through the help of gravity and a slight amount of friction existing within hinge brackets 38.  If desired, a suitable hook can be located near one or both of the head rests 24 of the vehicle to secure
the lower divider portion in its closed position.
In FIG. 8, divider 26 is shown with a molded hinge construction 32' interconnecting its upper portion 28 and lower portion 30.  The manner of operation and attachment of this embodiment of the divider is the same as that previously described for
the divider illustrated in FIGS. 1-5.
In FIG. 6 ends 46 of upper divider portion 28 are provided with overlapping extensions 50.  Each extension 50 is connected to an end 46 of the upper divider portion by means of screws 52 which extend through slotted openings 54 in the extension
and which are turned into the upper divider portion.  Slots 54 allow extensions 50 to slide outwardly and inwardly as indicated by arrows 56 in FIG. 6 so as to extend the size of the upper portion 28 of the divider in order to accommodate vehicles of
various width as measured between sides 16.
The lower edge of lower divider portion 30 may be notched at 58 to accommodate head rests 24 carried by front seat 18 of the vehicle.
It is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the details above given but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims.

being deflected in response to an external impact against said bumper causing said bumper and, hence, said filler member to move relative to said adjacent body portion.  ",,"This invention relates
generally to automotive bumper-to-body filler means and, more specifically, to such filler means having provisions incorporated therein for ""springing back"" to an original free position after being deflected for any reason.
With the advent of automobile bumpers having energy-absorber means associated therewith for returning the bumpers to their original positions after any movement or deflection occasioned by external impact thereagainst, such bumpers having
generally been spaced a predetermined distance apart from the adjacent automobile body, there has arisen a need to not only fill the space therebetween for the sake of appearance, but to assure that such filler will be able to deflect or buckle, etc.,
with movement of the bumper relative to the body and, thence, be able to return to its original position upon retraction by the energy-absorber type bumper.
Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide improved bumper-to-body filler means which satisfies the above-described need.
Another object of the invention is to provide improved bumper-to-body filler means including an exposed filler member, and associated nonexposed filler support members which support the filler member in a predetermined position intermediate the
bumper and the adjacent body and serve to cause the filler to ""spring back"" after being deflected or buckled for any reason, such as by external impact thereagainst or against the automobile bumper.
A further object of the invention is to provide improved bumper-to-body filler means including a filler member extending across the width of the automobile in the space between the bumper and the adjacent automobile body, and left- and right-hand
support members therefor, each of such support members including an upper wall to which the filler member is secured, a lower wall which is secured to the bumper assembly, and one end wall interconnecting the upper and lower walls, with a plurality of
spaced U-shaped brackets or ribs formed around the inner surfaces of the upper, end, and lower walls, serving to provide a spring-back action to the end and upper walls and, hence, to the filler member in the event of any deflection thereof resulting
from an external source impact against the associated bumper. These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent when reference is made to the following description and accompanying drawings, wherein:
FIG. 1 is a rear view of an automobile embodying the invention;
FIGS. 2 and 3 are fragmentary cross-sectional views taken along the planes of lines 2--2 and 3--3, respectively, of FIG. 1, and looking in the direction of the arrows; and
FIG. 4 is an exploded perspective view of a portion of the FIG. 1 structure. Referring now to the drawings in greater detail, FIG. 1 illustrates an automobile 10 having a rear bumper 12 mounted laterally thereacross, just below a pair of
tail light housings 14 mounted substantially at the corners of the automobile body and an intermediate body portion 16.  The latter body portion 16 may consist of a metal strip or a series of laterally aligned back-up light and/or turn signal lenses
mounted adjacent the bottom edge of a trunk lid 18.  A housing or compartment 20 for a license plate mounting bracket and/or a gasoline tank inlet cover may be formed so as to separate the body portion 16 into left- and right-hand sections.
A bumper-to-body flexible filler and filler support arrangement 22 is mounted longitudinally between the bumper 12 and the rear body sections 16, and laterally between the tail light housings 14.
As illustrated in FIGS. 2-4, the bumper-to-body flexible filler and filler support arrangement 22 includes a molded plastic filler member 24 mounted on substantially a horizontal or slightly upwardly sloping plane, as desired, in the space
between the upper edge of the bumper and the bottom edges of the body portion 16.  As may be noted in FIG. 4, the filler member 24 includes a central open portion which serves as the compartment 20, the central open portion being formed to include bottom
and side walls 26 and 28, respectively, and a U-shaped flange 30 formed along the rear edges of the bottom and side walls 26 and 28.  Apertures 32, formed in the side walls 28, serve as a means for mounting light sources 34 (FIGS. 1 and 2) for
illuminating the usual license plate which may be mounted therebetween.  Substantially vertical, downwardly extending flanges 36 and 38 are formed on the rear edge of the filler member 24, on respective opposite sides of the compartment 20 for a purpose
to be explained.
The filler member 24 is supported by a pair of left- and right-hand filler support members 40 and 42, respectively, (FIG. 4), each having an upper wall 44, a lower or bottom wall 46, and an end wall 48 interconnecting the upper and bottom walls. 
A plurality of flexible U-shaped support brackets or ribs 50 are formed so as to be secured along the outer edges thereof against the respective inner surfaces of the upper, bottom and end walls 44, 46, and 48.  The ribs 50 may be either separately
formed, detachable parts or integrally molded components of the filler member 24.
The filler member 24 is secured to the end walls 48 of the filled support members 40 and 42 by suitable fasteners 52 (FIG. 3) mounted through the respective flanges 36 and 38, while the filler support members 40 and 42, in turn, are secured to
the upper surface 54 of a reinforcement member 56 by suitable fasteners 58 (FIG. 2) mounted through the respective bottom walls 46.  The reinforcement member 56 is secured by any suitable means, such as welding, to the inner surface of the bumper 12.  As
may be noted in FIG. 4, the upper surface 54 of the reinforcement member 56 includes a plurality of pockets or slots 60 formed across the width thereof, i.e., perpendicular to the bumper 12, in order to better reinforce the bumper 12.  Suitable energy
absorbers 62 (FIG. 3) are secured by fasteners 64 adjacent the respective vertical mounting surfaces 66 (FIG. 4) formed adjacent the ends of the reinforcement member 56, to return the latter and its associated bumper 12 to its original position after any
impact-actuated movement thereof.  It may be also noted in FIG. 4 that the bottom walls 46 of the filler support members 40 and 42 are shaped so as to conform to the general shape of the surface 54 of the member 52, spanning any adjacent pockets 60.
The filler member 24 and the filler support members 40 and 42 are each formed of a suitable plastic material.  Upon impact, the plastic materials can deflect without damage thereto, with the ribs 50 providing a ""spring"" action for returning the
filler member 24 to its original position with respect to the bumper 12 and the laterally aligned lenses 16.
It should be apparent that the invention provides external means for enhancing the appearance of the rear portion of an automobile, while including inherent means for restoring the inventive assembly to its original position after having been
distorted by impact thereagainst.
It should also be apparent that the inventive filler and support arrangement may be used in conjunction with either a front or a rear bumper system.
While but one embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, other modifications thereof are possible.

",,"The present invention relates to a lightweight vehicle giving very high performances but affording a considerable degree of security, more particularly designed for young, athletic customers.
This vehicle is a hybrid between two-seater motorcycles which are rapid and suitable for competition but which are very uncomfortable and, in particular, extremely dangerous, on one hand, and conventional classical automobiles which are generally
fragile and lack sufficient power for good performances when they are within a price range compatible with the finances of the purchasers.
The Applicant has made a synthesis of the new concepts made possible by recent progress in aerodynamics, the application of new materials used in architecture and the well known permanent bases.  The present inventor has U.S.  Pat.  Nos. 
3,298,707 and 3,539,030 also directed to such vehicles.  These vehicles and the present invention have in common the basic concept of comprising a body of tapered shape, the front part forming the large end of which is well rounded, the master couple of
which is placed substantially in the first third of the total length of the vehicle, the front end of which is occupied by the spare wheel which is mounted on a shaft firmly secured to the vehicle and is combined with two side shields very strong and
resistant in the horizontal plane, smooth and devoid of asperities.
Each of the patents concerns a particular construction seeking to resolve a specific problem.  In U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,298,707 there is above all resolved the problem of stability by means of a central body provided on either side with two wing
portion arranged one behind the other and offset one with respect to the other, these wing portions having a negative aerodynamic lift which balance at any moment the position lift of the central body.  U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,539 resolves the problem of a
vehicle just as capable of carrying the conductor alone as a large number of passengers with numerous baggage at high speed and in full security without the equilibrium of the vehicle being disturbed.
The present invention resolves the problem of a lightweight vehicle giving very high performances but affording a considerable degree of security, more particularly designed for young, athletic customers.
In addition to the means employed in the basic concept mentioned above, are combined the following:
The rear wheels are separate from the cockpit and housed at the two extremities of a profiled transverse appendix extending on either side of the rear point of the cockpit and forming a horizontal stabilizer;
TWO SEATS ARE DISPOSED TANDEM-WISE INSIDE THE COCKPIT; AND
AN AERODYNAMIC BRAKE CONSTITUTED BY FLAPS PIVOTABLE ABOUT A TRANSVERSE PIN LOCATED BEHIND THE HORIZONTAL APPENDIX AND DISPOSED ON THE UPPER SIDE OF SAME, SAID FLAPS BEING CONTROLLED BY THE DRIVER, WHEN THE VEHICLE SPEED IS SUFFICIENT FOR
AERODYNAMICALLY ACTING BRAKING TO BE EFFICIENT.
Owing to this synthesis, the Applicant has been able to design a vehicle that is extremely rapid but which is of medium power, owing to its aerodynamic properties and lightness; it is very robust and shock resistant owing to its enveloping
structure and its frontal and lateral shields; it is very stable and reliable owing to its tail stabilizer unit and aerodynamic braking system and its ability to lean into bends in order to cancel out the effects of centrifugal force, in the same way as
a motorcycle.
For this purpose, the vehicle comprises a stream-lined cockpit the front portion of which is well rounded, both horizontally and vertically, and whose maximum cross-section is located substantially in the front third of the total length of the
vehicle and which is perfectly circular.
The two front wheels are integrated inside the rounded front portion assembly while the two rear wheels are, on the contrary, separate from the cockpit and housed at the two extremities of a profiled transverse appendix extending on either side
of the rear point of the cockpit and forming a horizontal stabilizer.
This horizontal stabilizer is completed by vertical stabilizers forming fins located respectively above the cockpit and at the two extremities of the horizontal stabilizer.
Two seats are disposed tandem-wise inside the cockpit, the driver's seat being at the point of maximum cross-section, with the provision of a framework constituted by a self-supporting main box-girder protecting the two occupants and a light
truss forming a multi-tubular system with which the cockpit bodywork, the transverse appendix and the fins are integral.
Finally, there is an aerodynamic brake constituted by flaps pivotable about a transverse pin located behind the horizontal appendix, controlled by the driver, when the vehicle speed is sufficient for aerodynamically acting braking to be
efficient.
Other characteristics, advantages and features of the present invention will become clear from the following description given with reference to the attached diagrams representing a possible form of embodiment of said invention by way of a purely
explanatory and in no way limitative example. In these drawings:
FIGS. 1 to 4 represent respectively an elevation, top, front and rear view of a vehicle according to the present invention;
FIG. 5 is an elevation view of the vehicle, analogous to that in FIG. 1, but showing the silhouettes of the two occupants in their seats;

FIGS. 15 and 16 are explanatory diagrams showing, in a simplified manner, how the active area of each main flap of the aerodynamic brakes can be increased by means of a mobile secondary flap, the wall of said flaps being taken as transparent for
clarity;
FIG. 17 is a front view of the vehicle according to the invention as it appears in a high speed braking phase, i.e. with its aerodynamic braking system fully extended;
FIG. 18 is a front view of the vehicle in the position inclined towards the inside of the bend that it can occupy in order to cancel out the effects of centrifugal force; and
FIG. 19 is a larger scale detail representing the steering wheel provided with its suspension control buttons. Generally speaking it is immediately clear from FIGS. 1 to 4 that the vehicle according to the invention has a rigorously
perfect shape aerodynamically.
Indeed, the body forming the cockpit designated by general reference number 1 comprises a forward portion 1.sub.A that is well rounded, both in the vertical plane (see FIG. 1) and in the horizontal plane (see FIG. 2).
The maximum cross-section M.sub.C is located in the front third of the total length of the vehicle, and its cross-section S.sub.C is that of the substantially perfect circle.
The median and rear portions of the body, designated by general reference 1.sub.B which occupy the remaining two thirds of the total vehicle length, possess, on the contrary, a tapered shape, only the trailing point of which is truncated to
receive the registration plate.
It should be noted that the two front wheels of the vehicle 1AG and 1AD are completely integrated inside the overall volume of front portion 1.sub.A.
On the contrary, rear wheels 1BG and 1BD are housed, for reasons which will be explained in detail subsequently, at the two extremities of a profiled transverse appendix extending on either side of the rear point of the cockpit, and which will
simply be designated by general reference numbers 2G, 2D for the time being.
Before pursuing the description, it is immediately noticeable that cockpit 1, viewed from the top, has the shape of a body capable of good penetration through the air and, in elevation view, the shape of a thick wing profile the elongation of
which is approximately the ideal elongation 4.
To prevent the vehicle from taking off at high speed, particularly when it is subject to the vertical accelerations resulting from bumps in the road, the cockpit-body 1 is set in such a way that its normal attitude PP.sub.1 has a slightly
negative angle .alpha., for example in the order of -3.degree., in relation to the horizontal plane HH.sub.1.
Furthermore, in order to obtain perfect road holding from drive wheels IBG, IBD, the longitudinal cross-section of transverse appendix 2G, 2D, previously mentioned, is given the profile of a thick wing matching that of the cockpit properly
speaking, but with a far more marked contra-lifting effect than that of said cockpit.
For this purpose, appendix 2G, 2D is set in such a way that its normal attitude PP.sub.2 has a markedly negative angle .beta., for example in the order of -18.degree., in relation to the horizontal plane HH.sub.1.  This appendix somewhat
constitutes a negatively set horizontal stabilizer.
Furthermore, three vertical stabilizers are provided, one 3C in the center and above the rear extremity 1B of the cockpit, the other two 3G and 3D at the two extremities of horizontal stabilizer 2G, 2D.
It should be pointed out that the assembly constituted by this horizontal stabilizer and the three fins forming vertical stabilizers, can be likened to the tail stabilizer unit of a dirigible balloon whose fuselage is constituted in this case by
cockpit 1.
Aerodynamically speaking, the vehicle according to the invention, apart from its air penetration qualities which are excellent owing to a very low air resistance factor C.sub.X in the order of 0.12 to 0.15, has the prime advantage of being
perfectly stable, and, consequently, unaffected by the particularly prejudicial action of cross winds.  In fact, owing to the tail stabilizers, the resultant of the aerodynamic forces is applied at a point well behind the center of gravity and the
vehicle is consequently autostable.
Furthermore, the vehicle is also mechanically stable, as the resultant of the action of the wheels on the ground is applied at a point located behind the center of gravity.
Owing to its aerodynamic qualities, its small height, its extremely small ground clearance, its small wheel base, the vehicle can be displaced by a low power engine (not represented) disposed just ahead of the geometrical axis of rear wheels 1BG,
1BD, while having a very low center of gravity located practically in the front third of the total vehicle length, i.e., practically at the maximum cross-section M.sub.C.  Furthermore, the vehicle can reach very high speeds in complete security.
As the vehicle according to the invention is destined, as already seen to very young, athletic clients fresh from their experience of motorcycles and, consequently, usually favouring two-seaters, it will automatically adopt the solution
recommended by the Applicant, which appears very clearly from FIGS. 2 and 5.
This consists, on one hand, in housing the two occupants, whose silhouettes are diagrammatically represented at 4.sub.A and 4.sub.B, behind one another on two seats 5A and 5B disposed tandem-fashion, and on the other hand, in protecting these
occupants extremely efficiently, as will be described in detail subsequently with reference to FIGS. 6, 7 and 8, by means of a protective robust smooth shield constituted by two lateral members 6G, 6D disposed on the sides of the vehicle and by spare
wheel 7, forming an impact deflector.  Furthermore, two very robust outer tubes, for example of steel, 8G and 8D, are anchored between the base of cockpit 1, at the level of the maximum cross-section and the respective bases of lateral fins 3G, 3D.
Owing to this design, the vehicle does not risk running foul of obstacles but quite to the contrary can ricochet against them.  Head-on impacts, which are the most fatal, are thus completely eliminated.
The two seats 5A, 5B are naturally provided with markedly rearward reclining backs so as to have as small a maximum cross-section M.sub.C as possible.  Furthermore, front seat 5.sub.A at least has a forward folding back so as to enable the
occupants of the rear seat, first, and then the driver, to take his seat inside the vehicle through a pivoting hatch 9 disposed on the roof of cockpit 1.
Wide curved bay windows 10 are provided all along the upper portion of the cockpit and enable the occupants to enjoy an excellent panoramic view, forwards and laterally and to the rear of the vehicle.
Furthermore, the vehicle is advantageously provided with an adjustable suspension of the type described in the Applicant's U.K.  patent 1,240,147 and U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,539,030.
As a brief reminder, by means of this adjustable suspension, the vehicle can occupy six different ground clearance levels diagrammatically represented in FIG. 3 by the six lines referenced 1 to 6, corresponding respectively to the following
different vehicle positions: very low for I; motor way for II; highway for III; dirt roads for IV; very high for V; and ultra-high for VI.  Ground clearance can be selected by the driver by means of a special control.
This suspension also makes it possible, as will be seen in detail subsequently, to cause the vehicle to lean into the bends to cancel out the effect of centrifugal force.
As regards the structure of the vehicle itself, it can be generally defined as being of the multi-tubular chassis type with a light weight alloy or plastic bodywork cladding said chassis and integral therewith.
More specifically, in order to obtain efficient protection for the occupants as well as good bodywork rigidity for a reasonable price, the base of said chassis is constituted using the cemented lamellated wood technique that has now been used for
a certain time in the building industry.
Practically speaking (see FIG. 6), the vehicle framework is constituted by: a self-supporting protective box type truss girder made of wood and designated by general reference number P; a truss of light alloy anchored in the girder and serving as
a substrate for the bodywork, designated by general reference T; and a light alloy or plastic bodywork cladding the girder and the truss, designated by general reference C.
More particularly, and by way of a non-limitative example represented in FIGS. 6, 7 and 8, the constituents P, T and C above can be designed as follows:
Girder P is advantageously constituted by:
two lower side-members 10G, 10D, curved upwardly at their front extremities in order to constitute a front shield 11 in which is anchored a housing 12 receiving impact-deflecting spare wheel 7 which is itself mounted idle on a pivot pin 12A
solidly attached to housing 12;
two upper side-members constituting lateral shields 6G, 6D, mentioned above, which are anchored, by their front extremities, to front shield 11;
transverse reinforcing pairs disposed respectively at the front of the vehicle at 13, at the level of the maximum cross-section at 14, and just ahead of the tail stabilizer unit at 15.
Truss T is constituted in a manner known per se by a system of steel or light alloy tubes appropriately triangulated as clearly seen from the diagram of FIG. 6.  Naturally, the different nodal points of the system are disposed at suitable
locations and serve as anchor points.
Bodywork C is constituted: either of light alloy sheets such as those known commercially under the names: ""DURALUMIN"" and ""DURALINOX,"" or of a laminated plastic cladding.  The sheets or plastic cladding are made integral as known ""per se"" with
truss T.
It should, however, be pointed out that a shield 18 articulated at 18A and constituted by a resistant sheet metal enables the front portion of the cockpit located above deflecting spare wheel 7 to be capped and protected.
Furthermore, bulbs 19A and 19B can advantageously be provided on the roof of the cockpit, respectively over hatch 9 and over the tapered portion of the cockpit located under central fin 3C.  These bulbs allow the occupants greater ease of
movement, more particularly if they wish to take part in a competition and are consequently obliged to wear helmets.
According to a particularly advantageous form of embodiment, each of the lateral protective shields 6G and 6D can be constituted, as represented in the cross-section of FIG. 8, by a certain number of strips, for example five, referenced 20.sub.A,
20.sub.B, 20.sub.C, 20.sub.D and 20.sub.E of low density resistant wood.  These strips are shaped according to the required curvature and then cemented to one another so as to form a perfectly homogeneous unit.
A recess 21 is provided on the outer strip, 20.sub.E in this case, and a soft rubber cushion 22 affording protection against slight impacts is cemented in said recess.
Cushion 22 attachment can be reinforced along its periphery by suitably distributing attachments such as 23.
Assembly between wooden girder P and the members of the metallic truss is by means of metallic collars.
Bodywork members C can be attached to the shield, for example by means of longitudinal angle irons such as 24, which are themselves attached by means of attachments such as 25, suitably distributed along strip 20.sub.D in this particular case.
According to another basic characteristic of the present invention, the front portion of the vehicle is equipped with aerodynamic brakes which considerably increase the security conditions when driving at high speeds.
Before describing the means enabling the design of aerobrakes by making full use of the very particular characteristics of vehicle according to the invention, a brief reminder will be given of the advantages of such aerodynamic brakes.
While it is difficult for conventional drum or disk brakes to retain their efficiency when the speed at which the vehicle is used increases, if only owing to the difficulty of discharging the calories generated by their prolonged use, the case of
a brake using only air resistance is quite different.  First of all, it should be noted that such a brake does not heat up, however long it is used.  Furthermore, as air resistance increases as a square of the speed, it becomes extremely efficient, even
for speeds commonly reached on the roads by present vehicles and more particularly by a vehicle according to the present invention.
Furthermore, as the aerobrake according to the invention is disposed, as will be described hereinafter, at the very rear of the vehicle, it increases the stability of the vehicle during braking in somewhat the same manner as the tail chute of an
aircraft.
Furthermore, as the aerobrake has a contra lifting effect, it markedly increases the road holding of the rear drive wheels, which makes it possible to provide for a system actuating the normal vehicle brakes by the air brake itself, this
comprising no risk of somersaulting or any particular effort on the part of the driver.
A description will now be given of a possible way of adapting an aerodynamic brake to the vehicle according to the invention referring first of all more particularly to FIGS. 9 to 14, it being noteworthy that, in order to avoid complicating the
description and drawings to no purpose, only one brake flap will be described, although the vehicle clearly comprises two disposed symmetrically in relation to longitudinal axis XX.sub.1.
In accordance with the invention, the transverse contra lifting stabilizer 2G, 2D is used to form, on either side of the vehicle, a main aerodynamic brake flap.  To do so, a trapezium shaped portion 26 is cut out of the upper surface wall and
articulated on a rear transverse pivot 27 by means of a robust reinforcing framework designated by reference 28.  It is immediately clear that flap 26 constituted in this way, when displaced from the position represented by the broken line in FIG. 10 to
that represented by a continuous line in the same figure, will expose a braking surface to air displacement whose effect will be the more efficient the higher the speed of the vehicle.
It is clearly understandable that no outside force need be applied to open flap 26.  In fact, it suffices, as will be seen in detail subsequently, simply to enable it to be released from its closed position for the action of the relative wind to
cause it to open immediately to its maximum position represented in FIG. 10.  It should be noted that the depression on the upper surface of the stabilizer clearly favours flap opening.
On the other hand, a control system of a possible form of embodiment of which has been represented in FIGS. 9 and 10, is necessary to close the flaps.
Framework 28 comprises a solid fin 29 on which is articulated the rear extremity of a longitudinal control rod 30.  The front extremity of the latter comprises a yoke 31 articulated on a slide 32 capable of sliding along the guide rod 33 firmly
anchored at both its extremities to two supports 34 and 35 integral with the lower side-member 10G of the box girder P forming the framework of the cockpit.
Slide 32 is connected, by means of a cable 36, to a reel drum 37 mounted on a transverse drive shaft 38 by means of a free-wheel system (not represented) enabling a drive motor 39 to return the slide 32 from its rear position to its forward
position and, consequently, to return the brake flap 26 from its open position to its closed position.
The motor 39 is preferably an electric motor actuated by a control button at the disposal of the driver.  An electric limit-switch 40 automatically stops motor 39 when slide 32 reaches its forward end position.
Furthermore, drum 37 is provided with an internal braking system (not represented) of any conventional type braking the movement of slide 32 when it is displaced from its forward position to its rear position, during the opening phase of flap 26.
As already seen, use can advantageously be made of the opening of flap 26 to act automatically on the conventional brakes, for example drum brakes, of the vehicle, and on the brake drum 41G in the case in point.
For this purpose (see particularly FIGS. 10, 11 and 12), a lever 42 whose rotation is associated with that of steering wheel 26, as clearly seen in FIG. 10, is articulated in the axis XX.sub.1, of the vehicle on fin 27 so that, when displaced
from its initial position 42.sub.I to its final position 42.sub.II (see FIG. 11), said lever engages, by its extremity 42.sub.A curved for this purpose, with the transverse pin 43 of a yoke 44 elastically carried by a support 45 and causes it to pivot
through an angle .theta..
This link 44 is connected by a connecting rod 46 to a transverse bar 47, on the two extremities of which are articulated connecting rods 48G and 48D respectively cooperating with the extremities of levers 49G, 49D controlling the two drum brakes
41G and 41D.
It is immediately clear that, when flap 26, under the action of a relative wind, opens and is displaced to position 26.sub.I in FIG. 10, lever 42 will at this moment engage pin 43.  By passing from position 26.sub.I to position 26.sub.II, in
which its aerodynamic braking effect is maximized, flap 26 will cause lever 42 to pivot through the same angle .theta..sub.1 and, through lever 46, bar 47 and rods 48G, 48D, will actuate drum brakes 41G, 41D, causing control levers 49G, 49D, to pivot
through an angle .theta..sub.2, causing efficient braking without danger or effort on the part of the driver.
It is quite clear that, as the aerodynamic brake is effective only when the vehicle is travelling at a sufficient high speed, a locking system should be provided to maintain flap 26 in closed position as long as the driver desires.
It is possible, for example, to adopt the form of embodiment represented in FIGS. 13 and 14.
Flap 26 comprises at its front extremity a support 50 carrying a pin 51 which, when the flap is in closed position (FIG. 13), is located between the two arms of a supporting fork 52 articulated on a fixed pin 53.  An elastic return system 54
interconnecting fork 52 to a fixed point 55 on profiled shelter 2G maintains fork 52 in closed position.
Furthermore, the latter is extended by a substantially orthogonal lever 56.  A cable 57 passing over a lazy pulley 58 connects the extremity of lever 56 to a lever 59 having the same pivot pin 60 as pedal 61 actuating the drum brakes of the
vehicle and forming therewith an angle .gamma.  when it is in rest position.
Lever 59 is normally disengaged so that, when the driver depresses pedal 61, this has no effect on said lever 59.  A control (not represented) placed at the disposal of the pilot, enables lever 59 to be engaged, when the vehicle is travelling at
a high speed, for example over 80 to 100 km/hour, which has the result of pushing out a stop 62 with which it is provided, behind brake pedal 61.
From this moment, it can be seen that when the driver depresses brake pedal 61, the latter when it has pivoted through angle 0.gamma., causes lever 59 to rotate.  The latter then pulls on cable 57, which causes assembly 56-52 to pivot about pin
53.  Immediately the spring return system 54 arrives at the level of pin 53, it exerts a bias effect and the pivoting assembly reaches the position represented in FIG. 14 in which flap 26 is slightly open and released.  The relative wind then causes flap
26 to open to its maximum position, as already described with respect to FIGS. 9 to 12, giving rise to very energetic aerodynamic braking as well as, at end of travel, the automatic action of the conventional vehicle brakes.
When the vehicle speed has dropped to a value compatible with non-use of the aerodynamic brakes, the flap is returned, by means of the previously described control system, to its closed position.  When the flap reaches the position represented in
FIG. 14, pin 51 penetrates fork 52 and pivots it to return it to its initial position as represented in FIG. 13, where it is locked immediately the spring return system 54 travels past the median instability position at the level of pin 53.
Quite clearly, the locking system can be actuated by any means other than lever 59.  The latter can, in fact, be replaced by a small aerodynamic flap placed at the front of the vehicle and which only moves when it is subjected to sufficient
thrust by the relative wind, it being possible to set this thrust, for example, for a vehicle speed in excess of 80-100 km/H.
It is immediately clear (FIG. 17) that, when the two lateral flaps 26G and 26D are in maximum open position, there is a vacuum, set up by the tapered shape of the rear portion of the vehicle, between said flaps and central pin 3C.
In order to cause the aerodynamic brake to act even more efficiently, each main flap 26G and 26D can advantageously be provided with a laterally pivoting additional flap 63G, 63D, which moves from a fully retracted position inside the
corresponding main flap, as represented in FIG. 15, to a fully extended position, as represented in FIG. 16, the pivoting of additional flap 63 being automatically actuated by the pivoting of corresponding main flap 26, thus automatically ensuring
complete blocking, as perfectly clear from FIG. 17.
Quite clearly, additional flap 63 matches the shape of the orifice to be blocked.  It is attached to a solid tubular armature 64, articulated on a pin 65 integral with the framework 28 of main flap 26.
Furthermore, this armature 64 of flap 63 comprises a roller 66 rolling in a circular guide coaxial with the axis of pivot 65.
In order to synchronize the extension of additional flap 63 with that of main flap 26, an extremely simple cable system such as that diagrammatically represented by way of example in FIGS. 15 and 16 can be used.  To the attachment point 68 of
mobile armature 74, which is offset in relation to the pivot 65, is attached the extremity of a cable 69 of fixed length which, after passing over a first lazy pulley 70 mounted on a pin 70.sub.A integral with the main flap 26, and over a second lazy
pulley 71 the pivot 71.sub.A of which is integral with the fixed portion of appendix 2G, is attached by its other extremity to a fixed attachment point 72 of appendix 2G.
It is immediately clear that if, with the main flap in closed position and the additional flap 63 in retracted position as represented in FIG. 15, the driver actuates brake pedal 61 to release the main flap 26 in the way previously described with
respect to FIGS. 13 and 14, said main flap 26 will open under the effect of the relative wind to reach the fully open position represented in FIG. 10 and cause the extension of the additional flap, as in proportion as main flap 26 pivots about pin 27,
pulley 70 itself pivots about the same pin.  Now, pin 70.sub.A of pulley 70 is disposed in relation to pin 27 and fixed pin 71.sub.A of pulley 71 in such a way that, when said pulley 70 pivots, its distance in relation to fixed point 72 to which cable 69
is attached increases.  As the latter is of constant length, it is consequently clear that, under the tensile stress applied by pulley 70, it causes the additional flap 63 to pivot about its pin 65 to bring it to the expanded position in FIG. 16.
In order to return the additional flap 63 to its retracted position inside the main flap 26, when the latter returns to its initial position, a spring return system is provided.
According to a particularly simple form of embodiment represented in FIGS. 15 and 16, this return system can be constituted by a single elastic cable of the ""sandow"" type fixed, at one of its extremities, to an attachment point 74 integral with
armature 64 of flap 63 and, at its other extremity, to an attachment point 75 integral with the main flap 26 and passing over two lazy pulleys 76 and 77 whose pivot pins 76.sub.A and 77.sub.A are also integral with the armature of main flap 26.
It is immediately clear that, when the additional flap 63 moves from its retracted position as shown in FIG. 15 to its extended position as represented in FIG. 16, the elastic cable 73 is compelled to elongate, clearly applying tensile stress to
mobile flap 63.  Immediately the latter is not longer subject to the tensile stress of cable 69, mobile flap 63 is automatically returned to its initial retracted position in proportion as the main flap 26 itself returns to its initial position.
Quite clearly, as distinctly illustrated in FIG. 17, the vehicle comprises a double aerodynamic braking system, a set of two flaps 26D, 63D in the case in point, opening between lateral fin 3D and a central fin 3C and a set of two flaps 26G, 63G,
opening between lateral fin 3G and central fin 3C.
It has already been seen that the driver could, as he chose, give the vehicle a ground clearance selected from six options by actuating a special control at his disposal.
Furthermore, it is well known that the young drivers for whom the vehicle according to the invention is particularly intended, tend to approach curves or bends very quickly owing to the fact that the motorcycles that they drive can be inclined to
balance the effect of the centrifugal force.
According to the invention, the principle of adjustable suspension described in the applicant's U.K.  patent No. 1,240,147 and U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,539,030 previously mentioned, which enables the vehicle to be caused to lean towards the inside of
the bends in order to cancel out the effect of the centrifugal force, is applied to the vehicle by adaptation.
For this purpose, (see FIGS. 18 and 19), steering wheel 80 comprises on its rim two pressure actuated control buttons 81G and 81D disposed in such a way that the driver can reach them selectively with his left or right thumb, without having to
release the steering wheel.
For a left-hand bend, for example as represented in FIG. 18, the driver depresses button 81.sub.G with his thumb on entering the bend, which has the result of varying the position of each of the four wheels so that they occupy the respective
corresponding positions in said FIG. 18.  In the case in question, only the front left-hand wheel 1AG does not have to change position in relation to its initial position.
On the other hand, the ground clearance for the left rear wheel 1BG decreases while this ground clearance increases both for the front and rear right-hand wheels 1AD, 1BD.
The suspension assembly is automatically reset when the steering wheel returns to its neutral position.
It goes without saying that this control can be designed in any appropriate known manner, preferably in accordance with the technique described in the above mentioned patents filed by the Applicant.
It goes without saying, moreover, that the present invention has been described and represented only by way of a preferred example of embodiment and that any equivalent means can be added to its constituents without forasmuch departing from the
scope of said invention as defined in the following claims.

This invention relates to overhead guards for use on vertical lifting machines, such as warehouse fork lifts or high stackers, where a load is lifted above the head of the machine operator and could present a safety hazard to the operator.
Some vertical lifting machines are of a type where the operator walks behind and controls a steering carriage of a self-propelled apparatus.  This manually-operated steering carriage permits the vertical lifting machine to be maneuvered in narrow
aisles or other close quarters.  Such machines are ordinarily not equipped with overhead guards, as a fixed overhead guard would increase the overall length of the apparatus, thereby significantly limiting its maneuverability.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides overhead protection for the operator of a vertical lifting machine during elevation of the load, yet does not add to the length of the machine or diminish its maneuverability in the transport mode.
A primary advantage of the invention is the retractable characteristic of the overhead guard.  By having the guard retractable or withdrawable from its protective position, maneuverability of the machine while in a load-lowered position is not
reduced by any lengthening projection or extension of the machine beyond its required original length.
An important feature of the invention is that the position of the overhead guard into an operator-protective position is not dependent upon separate operator actuation.  The posture of the overhead guard in both the operator-protective and
retracted positions is established automatically in response to upward or downward motion of the machine.
Automatic positioning of the overhead guard is achieved mechanically without the need for electric or hydraulic accessory equipment.  This feature provides for a high degree of reliability which is important for safe machine operation.
A further advantage of the invention is its rugged construction which provides a reliable shield against falling objects.  The degree of structural rigidity can be adapted to suit the requirements of the working environment.
Still another feature of the invention is that the overhead guard is perforated to permit the operator to see the load carried by the machine in an elevated position.  Likewise, when the overhead guard has been retracted upward to a
non-protective position, the operator can see beyond it for safe steering of the machine.
Another feature of the invention is that it can be fabricated and installed on a fork lift unit or high stacker or other form of lifting machine at a relatively low cost.
It is to be noted that the invention can be utilized on a variety of lifting equipment where overhead protection for the operator is needed and where a fixed overhead guard would interfere with maneuverability of the apparatus or would otherwise
create a space problem, regardless of whether the equipment carries the operator or he walks alongside.
Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent during the course of the following description and with reference to the following drawings in which like numerals are used to designate like parts throughout the same.

A self-propelled vertical lifting machine 11, such as a warehouse fork lift truck, is provided with a movable steering arm 12 having a switch or electrical control box 13 mounted thereon within convenient reach of the operator.  In order to keep
the length of the apparatus to a practicable minimum where maneuverability of the apparatus in restricted space conditions is a factor, no provision is made for carrying the operator on the machine.  The operator steers and operates the machine while
walking or standing behind or adjacent to the arm 12 and its associated control box 13.  The machine is equipped with a retractable overhead guard 14 which, in the protective position shown, overhangs the operator to shield him from injury by cartons or
objects which may accidentally be dislodged from overhead shelves or from the fork of the machine when it is raised.  As best seen in FIG. 2, the overhead guard has a rigid peripheral frame 15 with intermediate spaced support cross members 16 attached
thereto and underlying an attached panel member 17.  The panel member could be a metal sheet, a wire mesh net, a closely spaced lattice of metal rods, or a grate, etc. It is desirable to use a panel member that is perforated to permit visibility
therethrough, permitting the operator to see the work area overhead.
The overhead guard is pivotally connected to a fixed portion of the machine.  As best seen in FIGS. 2 and 3, spaced and coaxially aligned tubular journal members 18 are welded to one end of the frame 15.  Spaced support brackets or ears 19,
having aligned openings 20, are welded to a cross bar 21 of the stationery column of the machine.  An axle or shaft 22 extends through the journal members 18 and through the support brackets 19 to pivotally connect the overhead guard to the fixed portion
of the machine.  Any conventional means, such as cotter pins, can be used to retain the axle or shaft against longitudinal displacement.
A telescopic or extendable strut or brace 23 is provided for the guard 14 in the form of a tube assembly comprising an inner tube or rod 24 slidably contained within an outer tube 25.  It is desirable, but not mandatory, that a pair of such
braces be utilized in parallel spaced relationship on opposite sides of the overhead guard.  The opposite ends of the telescopic assembly are pivoted to the overhead guard and to the machine, as at 26 and 27 respectively.
The telescopic strut has a minimum operating length established by the abutment of one end of outer tube 25 with a stop 28 which is slidably mounted on the rod 24 and adjustably secured thereto.  At the selected minimum operating length, the tube
assembly acts as a structural support member which arrests further downward angular movement of the overhead guard about the shaft 22.  As a structural member capable of carrying loads, the extendable strut 23 enables the overhead guard to withstand
impact loads from falling objects.
Adjustment of the position of the stop 28 establishes the angle of rest for the guard and the extent to which it will project in a horizontal direction beyond the nominal periphery defining the inherent length of the lifting machine.  If
adjustability of the lowered position of the guard is not desired, the adjustable stop 28 may be eliminated and the minimum length of the strut assembly is then determined by a fixed stop or by the abutment between the telescopic components 24 and 25. 
When the strut 23 has telescoped to its minimum length, the overhead guard is in an operator-protective position, as shown in solid lines in FIG. 1.
As is well known in the art, high-lift fork trucks or stackers are ordinarily provided with one or more slidably movable column assemblies 29 which nest relatively to a fixed column assembly 30.  The movable column assembly includes parallel
spaced uprights or column members 31 and an integrated cross-member or cross-bar 32 extending across the uprights and functioning as a stay or tie bar.  Integrated with the overhead guard and projecting therefrom are one or more extensions or lever arms
33 which project beyond the pivotal connection of the guard and into the path of movement of the cross-bar 32 as it moves between its elevated and its lowered positions.
FIGS. 4-6 show the sequence of operation of the overhead guard in relation to the operation of the lifting machine.  FIG. 4 shows the fork 41 of the lifting machine in a raised position.  As the load or the fork is lowered, the cross-bar 32
approaches and engages the lever arm or arms 33 to initiate downward camming displacement of the free ends of the lever arms and cause pivotal upward movement or retraction of the guard 14, as indicated in FIG. 5.  As cross-member 32 continues its
downward movement, as shown in FIG. 6, the cross-bar approaches its lowermost position and the undersurface 34 thereof disengages from the lever arms which now abut the adjacent vertical surface 35 of the cross-bar and are thereby held or restrained
against reverse pivotal movement.  The overhead guard has thereby been automatically pivoted to its upward or retracted position in response to downward movement of the load-carrying fork of the lifting machine.  It will be noted that there is a
lost-motion relationship between the lever arms 33 and the cross-bar 32 which permits a substantial downward movement of the movable column 29 and its cross-bar 32 without affecting the operator-protective posture of the overhead guard 14.  It is only
when the movable column and the fork 41 approach their lowermost positions that the cross-bar 32 engages the lever arms 33 to initiate withdrawal of the guard 14.  In its retracted position, the guard 14 does not extend or increase the effective length
of the lifting machine and the operator can maneuver the machine around corners and within narrow aisles as easily as if the overhead guard were not present.
When the operator elevates the load, the column assembly 29 and its cross-member 32 move upwardly from the lever-restraining position shown in FIG. 6, allowing the preponderant weight imbalance of the overhead guard rearwardly of the pivot shaft
22 to cause its downward pivotal movement to the extent permitted by the restraining engagement of the cross-member 32 with the lever arm 33, as indicated in FIG. 5.  This downward angular displacement of the guard continues until the pivotal movement is
arrested by the established limit of telescopic contraction of the strut assembly 23.  At this point, the cross-member 32 disengages from the lever arms; the overhead guard is in its operator-protective posture, as shown in FIG. 4; and further elevation
of the fork may continue to any desired height without affecting the position of the guard.
Thus, without any required attention from the operator, the overhead guard is automatically lowered into protective position during the initial phase of elevating movement of the lifting machine so that the head and body of the operator will be
protected against falling objects which may be dislodged as a result of the lifting and stacking movement.  At this point in the operation of the lifting machine, the machine has already been maneuvered into a selected position and any increase in length
of the machine which is attributable to the rearward extension of the overhead guard in its horizontal position will not interfere with the stacking function of the machine.  After the fork has been lowered, the danger or hazard of operator injury as a
result of falling objects is minimized so that the contemporaneous retraction of the overhead guard then permits the lifting machine to be maneuvered to its next destination or function without the increased length that would result from the use of a
fixed rearwardly extending overhead guard.
A modification of the invention is shown in FIG. 7.  In this modified embodiment, a force-exerting member in the form of a compression coil spring 36 is retained within the outer tube 25 of the extendable strut and reacts against an enlarged end
37 of the rod 24.  The force exerted by the energized spring 36 is of a sufficient magnitude to raise the overhead guard to the retracted position.
An extension arm 38 is affixed to the overhead guard at an upwardly directed angle relatively to the plane of the overhead guard.  A shoe or roller 39 is attached to the free end of the extension arm 38.  Each extension and roller assembly
defines a cam which is positioned for abutment with the opposed surface or face 40 of an adjacent column upright 31 when the column 29 is moved upwardly, as shown in solid outline in FIG. 7, but the roller 39 assumes an elevated position projecting above
the column 29 and its cross-bar 32 when the column is in its lowermost position shown in phantom outline in FIG. 7.
In the load-lowered position, the roller is free of engagement with the face 40 of upright 31 but does overlie and engage the cross-bar 32 to limit the upward pivotal movement of the guard 14.  This upward movement is effected by the action of
the spring 36 in yieldably extending the telescopic tube assembly or strut 23.  When the fork 41 is raised, the column 29 moves upwardly and the cross-bar 32 cams the roller 39 in opposition to the spring-loaded telescopic struts to cause pivotal
displacement of the guard to its operator-protective position.  In this position, the roller abuts the opposed column face 40 to prevent any counter-rotation of the guard.  Further impact or load-induced downward pivotal movement of the guard is limited
by the minimum operating length established for the strut assembly.  Downward movement of the guard effects energization of the spring 36 to cause retraction of the guard when the fork is again lowered.
It is to be understood that the forms of my invention, herewith shown and described, are to be taken as preferred examples of the same, and that various changes in the shape, size and arrangement of parts may be resorted to, without departing
from the spirit of my invention, or the scope of the subjoined claims.

The field of art to which the invention pertains includes vehicular protective overhead guards.
Driver overhead guard structures have generally been adopted as standard equipment on lift trucks for the protection of operators from falling objects under specified conditions.  It is of advantage to maximize standardization of chassis design
within a given range of truck lifting capacities by including means for adjusting the truck frame or counterweight in a longitudinal direction as a function of the maximum load to be handled in any given truck operation.  Various constructions have
heretofore been devised for this purpose, a relevant one of which is disclosed in assignee's U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,061,034.
It is also of advantage to provide an overhead guard device for such vehicles which provides adjustment means for varying the effective length thereof, either in combination with a longitudinally adjustable counterweight, as in the
above-mentioned patent, or for different trucks having different capacities whether the counterweight of any given such truck is adjustable or not, and to which such an adjustable overhead guard is adaptable.
A previous design for a longitudinally adjustable guard for the above purpose is disclosed in assignee's U.S.  Pat.  No. 3,687,484.
SUMMARY
My invention is an improvement in adjustable overhead guard structure for industrial vehicles such as lift trucks.  It is a primary object of the invention to provide an improved driver's overhead guard device for vehicles which provides improved
adjustment means for varying the effective length of the guard device.  The guard may also be used in combination with a longitudinally adjustable vehicle counterbalance or other device so that for any given adjusted location of the counterbalance or
device within a predetermined range the guard device may be adjusted to maintain a structurally strong and rigid connected relationship to the counterbalance or device.
Other more particular objects and features of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description and drawing forming a part hereof. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING

Although my invention is applicable to any suitable industrial type vehicle having a need therefore, it is particularly suited for lift truck applications which will be referred to hereinafter for convenience.  The guard assembly 10 includes a
pair of rigid forward guard legs 11 secured to truck mounting posts shown in broken lines at 12, an overhead guard canopy grid assembly 14 extending over an operator's compartment in the usual manner having a pair of side rails 16 connected rigidly to
forward legs 11 and having a front reinforcing structural member 18 with a U-shaped open pocket portion 20 and a transverse reinforcing structural member 22 adjacent the rear end of the side rails which is adapted to be connected by a pair of downwardly
extending rigid pivotal structural leg members 24 to any one of a plurality of counterweights or to a single longitudinally adjustable counterweight for various size trucks and/or battery compartments.  The adjustable and, alternatively, multiple
counterweights, for convenience of illustration, are represented at 27 simply by the broken lines of a counterweight.
Each leg 24 comprises preferably a rigid hollow box beam having secured at the upper end thereof a block member 26 and a longitudinal plate member 28 having three spaced openings 30, 32 and 34 therein.  An opening 36 extends through the upper end
of leg 24, block 26 and plate 28 for registry with a pivot post 38 having a threaded end 40 for receiving a nut 42, post 38 being rigidly secured, as by welding, at its one end to the end of the respective side rail 16.
A plurality of threaded openings 44, 46, 48 and 51 are so located in the rear portion of each side rail 16 that when located in registry with respective ones of openings 30, 32 and 34 the adjustment positions of leg 24 as illustrated by letters
A, B, C and D, may be effected.  The threaded openings 44, 46, 48 and 51 have been numbered in a sequence corresponding to the letter sequence A, B, C and D denoting the said pivotal positions of legs 24.  For example, to secure each leg 24 in position A
the leg is pivoted on post 38 to align axially openings 30 and 44 and a threaded bolt 50 is inserted to secure plate 28 to side rail 16 in that position.  Maximum rearward pivotal adjustment of the legs, as shown, is effected by pivoting leg 24 on post
38 to align openings 30 and 51 tightening nut 42 and inserting and tightening bolt 50 in said openings, thereby effecting rigid leg position D. Intermediate pivotal positions B and C are effected by aligning and securing pairs of openings 32, 46 and 34,
48, respectively, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4.
The bottom of each leg 24 may be suitably secured in any one of its various adjustment positions by an angle bracket 52 which may be secured to any one of a number of counterweights for different length trucks, or to a single counterweight
securing leg 24 adjustable to various longitudinal positions on a single truck.  This may be done simply by selectively locating a stud 54 on a respective counterweight and securing leg 24 to the vertical post portion 56 of each bracket by a bolt and nut
58 which extends through alignable openings in leg 24 and post 56.  The same bracket 52 may be used in each of the four adjustment positions illustrated while being capable of alignment with the openings for reception of bolt and nut 58 by the use of
shims 60, 62 and 64 of various predetermined thicknesses to effect such alignment in each of the positions B, C and D, the construction being such, of course, that studs 54 are adapted to connect each combination of bracket and shim to the respective
counterweight or adjusted counterweight position in the range of truck capacities and/or truck battery compartment length as may be involved for the same or different lift trucks.  Of course, it will also be appreciated that the same construction is
applicable to a variety of types of lift trucks or other industrial vehicles having prime movers other than electric, such as internal combustion engines.
My invention provides, as will now be appreciated, structurally rigid design of relatively high strength for adjustable overhead guards.  It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes in the structure and relative
arrangement of parts may be made without necessarily departing from the scope of my invention.

",,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates generally to reducing aerodynamic drag imposed on vehicles such as trucks, trailers, trains, etc., and more particularly concerns the provision of means to prevent, reduce, or delay separation of boundary layer air flow
about such vehicles thereby enhancing fuel savings.
Many vehicles (trucks, trailers, trains) are constructed in a box like fashion with sharp 90.degree.  corners.  This is done both for ease in fabrication and to maximize the number of rectangular crates or other load shapes that can be carried. 
When such vehicles move, the sharp edges cause the air to separate at the corners and cause the box like body to have high aerodynamic drag, thus requiring more propulsive power.  While rounding off such corners can reduce drag, this expedient is
undesirable from two points of view; first it reduces the interior storage capacity (frequently by much more than the actual reduction in storage area because of the modular nature of the crates or payload); and secondly, it is often not convenient or
possible to modify existing vehicles this way, since much of the structure is in edge framing.  Thus, there is a clear need for means which will achieve the effect of a rounded corner without requiring extensive body rework and without reducing interior
capacity.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is a major object of the invention to provide a solution or solutions to the above difficulties and problems.  The invention is particularly adapted for use with a vehicle body having a longitudinally elongated corner from which body surfaces
extend at an angle, one of the surfaces presented forwardly toward oncoming relative air flow, and the other surface extending generally rearwardly away from the corner.  In this environment, the invention basically comprises:
A. MEANS FOR PREVENTING, REDUCING, OR DELAYING SEPARATION OF THE FLOW BOUNDARY LAYER FROM SAID OTHER SURFACE REARWARDLY OF SAID CORNER AT NORMAL OPERATING SPEEDS OF THE VEHICLE,
B. SAID MEANS COMPRISING A LONGITUDINALLY ELONGATED PROTRUSION HAVING A SUBSTANTIALLY SMOOTH, ARCUATE OUTER SURFACE PROJECTING SMOOTHLY OUTWARDLY OF A FIRST OF SAID BODY SURFACES, SAID PROTRUSION SURFACE HAVING A FIRST LONGITUDINALLY ELONGATED
TERMINAL EXTENT MERGING TOWARD SAID FIRST BODY SURFACE IN SPACED RELATION TO SAID CORNER, AND SECOND LONGITUDINALLY ELONGATED TERMINAL EXTENT MERGING TOWARD A SECOND OF SAID BODY SURFACES PROXIMATE SAID CORNER.
As will appear, the protrusion typically extends outwardly of the first body surface to maximum extent between 2 and 20 inches; it may have generally hook-shaped cross sections particularly when formed as a one-piece thin-walled molded unit; and
a vortex generator and/or a flow turning vane may be incorporated with the protrusion as will be seen.  Further, the protrusion or protrusions may be incorporated on side walls as well as front facing walls of vehicles, and may be inflatable.
These and other objects and advantages of the invention, as well as the details of illustrative embodiments, will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings, in which: DRAWING DESCRIPTION
FIG. 1 is a perspective showing an application of the invention;
FIG. 2 is an enlarged vertical section taken on lines 2--2 of FIG. 1;
FIG. 3-7 are views like FIG. 2, showing variations; and FIG. 8 is a section on lines 8--8 of FIG. 1; and
FIG. 9 is a fragmentary side elevation showing the side wall of a trailer body incorporating the invention; DETAILED DESCRIPTION
In FIGS. 1 and 2, a vehicle body, as for example a truck trailer body 10, has a longitudinally elongated corner 11 from which body surfaces extend at an angle.  One of the surfaces, such as surface 12a of upstanding front wall 12, is presented
forwardly toward oncoming relative air flow indicated by arrow 13, and the other surface 14a of horizontal top wall 14 extends generally rearwardly away from corner 11.  Surfaces 12a and 14a typically extend at about a 90.degree.  angle.
In accordance with the invention, means is provided to prevent or substantially reduce or delay separation of the air flow boundary layer from the other surface 14a rearwardly of the corner 11 at normal operating speeds of the vehicle, as for
example about 30 to 60 miles per hour.  Such means comprises a longitudinally elongated protrusion 15 having a substantially smooth, arcuate outer surface 16 projecting smoothly outwardly of a first of the body surfaces, such as surface 12a in FIG. 2. 
The protrusion surface 16 is generally forwardly convex at 16c in planes normal to the longitudinal direction indicated by arrows 17 in FIG. 1; surface 16 has a first longitudinally elongated extent 16a merging or tapering toward the first surface 12a in
spaced relation to the corner 11; and surface 16 has a second longitudinally elongated extent 16b merging toward the second 14a of the body surfaces, proximate the corner.  The protrusion 15 may be molded of reinforced thin-walled plastic material, such
as glass fibers and resin, and the longitudinal terminal flaps 15a and 15b defining surfaces 16a and 16b may be bonded or otherwise attached to the body surfaces 12 a and 14a, as shown.  Note the general ""hook-shape"" of the illustrated thin-walled
protrusion.  The radius of curvature of the protrusion surface at 16 must exceed the thickness of the local air flow boundary layer that exists at walls 12 and 14 before the addition of the protrusion; and one may determine, by design or testing, the
protrusion shape that results in the least boundary layer separation over the normal vehicle operating speed range.  For best results, the maximum projection t of the protrusion from the wall should be between 2 and 20 inches.  Other possible shapes of
surface 16a are shown at 16a' and 16a"".
Similar protrusion 18 may be located adjacent the upright corners or edges 19 defined by the vehicle body front wall 12 and upright side walls 20, as seen in FIGS. 1 and 8.  All of such protrusions contribute substantially to reductions in drag
otherwise induced by air flow past the sharp corners 11 and 19, and consequently fuel savings result.  Note the diagonal interfitting of the protrusions 15 and 18 at loci 21, this being one form of mating of the protrusions.  The FIG. 9 modification
shows similar horizontal and vertical protrusions 22 and 23 extending along the top horizontal and front and rear vertical edges of the truck or vehicle body side wall 20.  This construction reduces the side thrust exerted on the body by sideward wind
gusts, and thereby reducing steering difficulties in gusty locations.
FIG. 3 shows the addition of a vortex generator 25 projecting forwardly from, or outstanding from the nose of the protrusion 15.  The generator element may have wedge or wing shape; it causes an exchange of momentum across the boundary layer that
forms on the protrusion, and tends to keep the flow further downstream from separating.  Such generators may be spaced along the longitudinal extent of the protrusions.  FIG. 4 illustrates the addition of flow turning or deflection vane 26 spaced
outwardly of the nose of the protrusions, the vane extending chordwise generally parallel to the surface of the protrusion which it overlies.  A strut 27 connects the vane to the protrusion.  The vane also aids in keeping the flow further downstream from
separating.  Note flow arrows 28.
In that form of the invention seen in FIG. 5, the modified protrusion 30 projects outwardly from body surface 14a rather than from surface 12a presented toward the oncoming flow.  In this case, the first terminal extent 31a of the protrusion
surface 31 merges toward the other body surface 14a in remotely spaced relation to corner 11, and the second terminal extent 31b of the protrusion merges toward the one body surface 12a proximate the corner 11.  FIG. 6 shows a modified form of the FIG. 5
design, with a vane 32 mounted to the nose of the protrusion 30, as by a strut 33.  Vanes 26 and 32 may be longitudinally elongated, i.e., extend lengthwise of the protrusion noses.  Vane 32 also extends chordwise generally parallel to that portion of
the protrusion surface which it overlies.
In FIG. 7, an inflated section 40a of a protrusion 40 is located adjacent corner or edge 41 which is elongated in a direction normal to the plane of that view.  In uninflated condition, that section may collapse close to or flatly adjacent the
surface of body wall 42 presented toward oncoming air flow as indicated by arrow 43.  At the option of the vehicle operator, an inflating means, may be operated to inflate the protrusion to the position shown.  One such means may include a gas pressure
source 44 connected via piping 45, valve 46 and piping 47 with the interior 48 of the protrusion.  Valve may have three positions, one in which only the source 44 communicates with the space 48, another in which the pipe 47 is closed-off to prevent
escape of gas from space 48, and a third in which gas is released from space 48 to outlet 49.  A flexible web section 40b of the protrusion is attached to the body wall 42 at 50, and at 51 to the protrusion section 40a, to be stretched into the position
shown upon inflation of section 40a.  Section 40a and 40b may consist of rubber or plastic.  Accordingly, the operator may or may not use the drag reduction means, at this option.
An alternate source of inflation pressure is shown at 60, and comprises a duct 61 with an inlet exposed to ram effect of on-coming air, thereby to provide ""self-inflation.""
In an actual test, a truck such as shown in FIG. 1 was extensively operated with and without protrusions, and gas mileage records were kept.  The truck was operated at various speeds under 55 miles per hour, on a predetermined course that
required both stop and go city driving conditions as well as expressway driving conditions.  After protrusions as at 15 and 18 in FIG. 1, and 22 in FIG. 9, were added, it was found that fuel consumption was reduced by about 17.2%.  The protrusions 15 and
18 projected outwardly by an amount t = 8 inches, and the protrusions 22 projected outwardly by an amount t = 5 inches.
The protrusion may alternately consist of a metallic sheet, or other suitable material, and may alternately be solid instead of thin-walled.
It is also contemplated that the protrusions may be removably fastened, as by suitable fasteners to the vehicle body, so as to be capable of removal and storage, or use, whenever desired.

",,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates generally to reducing aerodynamic drag on vehicles such as trucks, trailors, etc. More particularly, it concerns the provision of means to eliminate or reduce the drag inducing effect of airflow through the gap between
vehicle components, as for example between truck tractor and trailer units.
It is found that a major cause of aerodynamic drag in tractor-trailer or tractor semi-trailer combinations, is the gap between the tractor and trailer units.  Certain of the relative airflow over the tractor cab passes downwardly into the gap and
then outwardly at the gap bottom and lateral sides, disturbing the airflow along the vehicle and creating drag.  Lateral cross-winds or gusts entering the gap have the same drag inducing effect.  While certain so-called air deflectors have been provided
on tractor cabs in the past, they do not operate in the manner provided by the present invention to reduce drag induced by airflow through the gap, and they tend to produce airflow conditions which do not sufficiently resist cross-wind flow into the gap.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is a major object of the invention to provide a drag reducing means that operates to decelerate relative airflow rearwardly into the gap, thereby to create air pressure conditions in the gap that tend to divert or prevent cross-wind flow
through the gap, thereby lessening drag.  Basically, the drag reducing means comprises:
A. POROUS STRUCTURE ADAPTED TO BE MOUNTED ON THE TRUCK TO PROJECT ABOVE THE CAB ROOF AND EXTEND LATERALLY, SO AS TO BE PRESENTED FORWARDLY TOWARD ONCOMING RELATIVE AIRFLOW FOR PASSING AIR REARWARDLY THERETHROUGH TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE BODY, WITH
ACCOMPANYING AIR DECELERATION RELATIVE TO THE TRUCK, AND
B. AIRFLOW DIRECTING MEANS AT LATERALLY OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE STRUCTURE FOR DIRECTING ONCOMING RELATIVE AIRFLOW LATERALLY AROUND SAID ENDS.
As will be seen, the porous structure extends upright and preferably contains through openings which may for example be circular, linear or have other shape; also the porous structure preferably has plate form and is spaced above the roof of the
tractor cab to provide an additional air decelerating passage directly above the roof.  Further, the airflow directing means may define forwardly protruding, upright surfaces at laterally opposite sides of the porous structure, whereby the combined
porous plate and flow directing protrusions are forwardly concave.  The lateral sides of the protrusions preferably extend rearwardly to block cross-wind disturbance of the decelerating flow rearwardly of the porous structure, and the latter may be
integral with or spaced laterally from the airflow directing means, as will be seen.
It is a further object of the invention to provide a protrusion or protrusions on the front wall and/or sides and/or top of the trailer unit to cooperate with the drag reducing means to further lessen drag, in the manner to be described.
These and other objects of advantages of the invention, as well as the details of illustrative embodiments, will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings, in which:

Referring first to FIG. 1, a truck tractor 10 is shown pulling a truck trailer unit 11.  The body 12 of the latter has an upstanding front wall 13 rearwardly of the tractor cab 14, and projecting upwardly above the roof level 15 of the cab.  The
tractor also conventionally includes wheels 150 and front windshield 16.
In accordance with the invention, drag reducing means comprises porous structure, as for example that shown at 17 in FIGS. 1-3, adapted to be mounted on the truck to project upwardly above the roof 15, and to extend laterally so as to be
presented forwardly toward oncoming relative airflow.  The porous structure is such as to pass oncoming air rearwardly therethrough toward the front 13 of the body 12, as indicated by the arrows 18a-18e in FIG. 3, and arrows 19a-19f in FIG. 4. 
Deceleration of the airflow relative to the truck is thereby achieved, as indicated by the divergence of such arrows at the rear of the structure 17, and a region of flow turbulence characterized by a large number of small eddy currents is apparently
formed.  Such small eddies are shown at 100 and are produced in the region 20, appearing to serve as a barrier to airflow into that region from the sides and top, as is clear from the flow arrows 22 in FIG. 3 and 23 in FIG. 4.  The average flow
velocities in the eddies are relatively low, which contributes to stabilization of the air mass in the gap.  This is significantly different from large scale vortices produced by an imperforate shield, which cause high fluctuating velocities and actually
induce airflow into the gap from the sides and top.  Further, the screen type unit 17 is subject to greatly reduced air loading and consequently reduces cab roof loading, as compared to an impervious air shield; also, unsteady buffeting is reduced, and
the truck driver achieves a smoother ride.
The porous structure may with unusual advantage comprise a porous plate 24 forming spaced apart, generally circular, through openings 25 as seen in FIGS. 2 to 4.  Alternatively, FIG. 9 shows linearly elongated horizontal openings 27 in modified
porous plate 24a, and FIG. 10 shows linearly elongated vertical openings 28 in modified porous plate 24b.  It is also clear from FIGS. 1, 2 and 4 that the porous structure is preferably mounted on the cab 14 in spaced relation above the cab roof 15, to
provide an opening or gap 29 between the lowermost extent of the porous structure and roof, and which provides for additional air deceleration, in the manner described above.  See flow arrow 30 through that gap or opening in FIG. 4.  Mounting brackets 31
and 32 may be provided for this purpose.
The drag reducing means also includes airflow directing means at laterally opposite sides of the porous structure for directing oncoming relative airflow around the laterally opposite ends of the porous structure.  As shown in FIGS. 1-4, the
airflow directing means 133 may with unusual advantage define surfaces 33 which are generally vertically elongated and project with forward convexity forwardly of a plane defined by the forward face of plate 24.  The surfaces also have rearward
extensions or skirts 33a which extend rearwardly of the plane of the plate 24, at the lateral boundaries of the airflow directing means.  The arrows 22 in FIG. 3 indicate that airflow is directed toward the lateral sides of the region 20 previously
described and that such flow is directed around the sharp corners or edges 37 at the lateral boundaries of body front wall 13; similarly, the arrows 23 in FIG. 4 indicate that airflow is directed toward the top of the region, and over the top edge of
corner 38 at the upper boundary of body front wall 13.  Furthermore, such flow paths tend to keep cross-wind gusts out of the region or gap 20 so as to eliminate or lessen drag that would otherwise be produced as a result of cross-wind flow through that
gap.  Thus, the vanes tend to rectify the cross-wind flow.
In FIGS. 1-4, the flow directing means 133 is advantageously made integral with the porous structure 17, i.e., as a single sheet or plate of material, such as molded glass fibers and resin.  The brackets 31 are shown as attached to the lower
extremities of the means 133, which is spaced above the cab roof 15.  Arrows 40 in FIG. 3 show oncoming airflow directed laterally reversely around the surfaces 33, forwardly of those portions 33b of surface 33 which concavely merge with lateral extents
of plate 24.  Accordingly, the surfaces 33 and plate 24 define a generally forwardly concave unit, with U-shaped cross sections in horizontal planes.
FIGS. 1-4 also show the employment of a refrigeration unit 110 mounted on the body front wall 13, for receiving impingement of airflow acting to transfer heat from the unit to the atmosphere.  Such heat is typically extracted from coolant fluid
circulated into the interior of the body 12 to maintain that interior at a low temperature.  The present invention does not impede the flow of air to the unit 110 and thereby enables it to function efficiently.  This is to be distinguished from generally
air impervious air shields mounted on the cab and which deflect the air around the gap 20 and as a result ""starve"" the refrigeration unit of cooling air, resulting in overheating of the refrigerator condenser unit, or of the motor driving the unit.
FIG. 11 shows alternate flow directing means in the form of forwardly directed vanes 142 having convex forward surfaces 42 and rearwardly tapering bodies 43 spaced at 44 from the lateral extents of porous structure 117.  Vanes 142 have about the
same height as the structure 117, and are attached as by brackets 142a or other suitable means to the cab roof.
Actual tests on a tractor and semi-trailer unit with and without the drag reducer of FIGS. 1-4 show 24% air drag reduction when the reducer was used.  Dimensions of the reducer were as follows:
Overall Height 36 inches  Width of Porous  plate 24 40 inches  Width of each Flow  director 133 16 inches  Radius of curved  surface 33 9 inches  Diameters of  holes 25 21/2 inches  Percentage of plate  24 area occupied by  holes 25 45-55%
Extending the description to FIG. 5, a modified drag reducer 50 (for decelerating relative airflow) includes a porous plate 51 and lateral flow directors 52 integral therewith.  Brackets 53 and 54 mount the reducer 50 to the roof 55 of truck
tractor 56.  The truck trailer 57 has a front wall 58, and a forwardly convex protrusion bounding at least a portion of the front wall and spaced rearwardly of the flow decelerating drag reducing means 50.  A gap is shown at 59 between the tractor and
trailer units 56 and 57, and the means 50 tends to keep cross-winds out of the gap, as described above, and thereby reduce drag.
The protrusion referred to above on wall 58 cooperates with the drag reducer 50, serving to lessen drag to even further extent, and may take the form of the protrusion structure described in co-pending application Ser.  No. 503,290 of Paul B.
MacCready, Jr., and Peter Lissaman.  For example, the forwardly convex protrusion may extend generally horizontally at 60 along the uppermost extent of front wall 58; alternatively, or in addition, the protrusion may extend generally vertically at 61
along sidewardmost extent or extents of the front wall.  Protrusions 60 and 61 merge at diagonal locations 160; and FIG. 6 shows that protrusions 61 extend laterally to greater extent than drag reducer 50, while protrusion 60 extends at a level above the
top-most level of reducer 50.  Finally, as in FIG. 5a additional horizontal and vertical protrusions 62 and 63 may be applied to the side wall or walls of the trailer body 57, in the manner described in said co-pending application, to lessen the effects
of cross-winds impinging on the body.  Also, a horizontal protrusion 64 may extend above the top surface 65 of the body 57 and laterally, adjacent horizontal corner 138, as seen in FIG. 8a.
Turning to FIG. 12, a unit 150, like that seen at 50 in FIG. 5, is pivotally mounted at 151 to the roof 152 of the tractor cab 153.  It is swingable about the horizontal transverse axis of the mount 151 between an up-position as shown in broken
lines 150a and a down-position in solid lines in which the structure extends generally horizontally forwardly.  In the latter position it offers very little wind resistance, as is desirable when the tractor is being driven with no trailer attached
thereto.  Actuator means may be connected with the unit 150 to swing same between up and down position as described.  One such actuator comprises a manually operable lever 154 pivotally connected with the cab at 155, and a link 156 pivotally connected at
157 to the lever and 158 to the unit 150.  In lever forward position, the unit 150 is in down position, and the lever may be held in that position by a clevis pin 159 inserted through the lever and into one opening in a fixed plate 160 attached to the
cab.  In lever rearward position, the unit 150 is in upright operative (air decelerating) position, and the lever may be held in that position by the clevis pin inserted through the lever and into another opening in the plate, at locus 159a.
 Turning to FIG. 13, the tractor cab 156, trailer body 112, and drag reducing unit 117 correspond to elements 56, 12 and 17, respectively, of FIGS. 1-4.  Also provided is a flexible curtain 170 extending generally vertically and forwardly in the
gap 120 between the cab and trailer body, generally centrally of the gap.  The curtain functions to block transverse flow of air through the gap, i.e., airflow in directions indicated by arrows 171 and 172.  Curtain 170 may be rolled on a spring-loaded,
vertical roller 173 carried at 174 by and adjacent the back wall 156a of the tractor cab.  The curtain rearward edge 170a extends adjacent the front wall 113 of the cab and is hooked at 175 to the latter, roller 173 tensioning the curtain, as by urging
it rearwardly in a roll-up direction at all times.  Thus, the curtain is maintained taut as the tractor turns relative to the trailer during operation of the rig.
In the FIG. 13a modification, the flexible curtain 270 extending in a vertical, forwardly extending plane, is wound on a vertical spool 271 carried by frame 272.  Attachment means, such as hooks 273 on the frame, and eye brackets 274 on the
trailer body front wall 213, removably attach the frame and curtain to the trailer body 212.  For example, the hooks are receivable in the eye brackets, as shown.  An adjustment handle 275 on the spool is rotatable to control the unwound length of the
curtain 270 extending in the gap 276 between the body front wall 213 and the tractor cab rear wall 277.
The forward edge portion 270a of the curtain 270 is attached to cables 278 which are spooled on a vertical drum 279.  The latter is spring-urged, internally, to tend to wind the cables, thereby to maintain the curtain 270 taut, as in FIG. 13, and
the drum yields to unspool the tensioned cables when the tractor turns relative to the tractor, widening gap 276.  Drum axles 280 are carried by bracket 281 attached to the tractor cab rear wall 277.
In use, the truck operator need only hook the bracket 272 onto a trailer, and adjust the length of the curtain 270 to the width of the gap, as by turning handle 275.  A suitable locking means, such as at 285, is provided to lock the curtain spool
271 against turning relative to bracket 272, when the curtain is selectively extended as shown, and tensioned as by the cables and drum 279.  Element 285 is shown as a lug thread connected to the handle 275, and capable of selective advancement to engage
openings in the bracket part 272a, and retraction to free the handle for turning.

INVENTION
The present invention relates to camping apparatus for assembly to vehicles of the van-type body.
Camping, as a recreational pastime, is undergoing an extensive expansion as more and more people utilize the national park system and public and private camp sites which are found in numerous recreational areas around the country.  As the
propensity for camping has increased, so has the number, design and function of the vehicles people utilize in their camping trips.  The so-called camping recreational vehicle has been developed to the point where it is literally an extension of one's
home incorporating many of the conveniences found therein.  Van-type vehicles are also finding extensive use in camping in that they are capable of additionally serving the function of being an all-around, multi-purpose family or commercial vehicle.  In
other words, the van-type vehicle utilized in camping may also be used as a primary or secondary car in a family as well as finding extensive use in commercial applications.
This expanded use has prompted many designers and individuals to outfit the van with various ammenities which one would find convenient on a camping trip.  For instance, storage cabinets, a dressing or eating table, awnings and other ammenities
have been found quite convenient to carry along on a trip.  The major drawback to the van, as opposed to the larger, more elaborately outfitted vehicle, is the rather limited space available in the interior of the van for storing these ammenities.  There
just is not enough room for free standing cabinets, separate table and the like, in the van while, at the same time, permitting occupants a certain degree of movement.  Therefore, it has been found convenient to transport certain ammenities, such as a
table, a bed, the cabinets and the awning in an unassembled state, in a condition wherein they can be stored in a relatively small space; assembly of these ammenities takes place outside the vehicle at the camp site.  The present invention is directed
toward just such assemblage which is affixed to the side panel of the vehicle, connected to the roof rain gutter and the lower body part.  A table suitable for eating, dressing or any other purpose, cabinets and an awning are among the ammenities that
are capable of being fixed to the skeletal support structure.  The instant invention provides an assemblage which is quite easily affixed to the vehicle and which provides many of the ammenities that are so necessary in camping excursions.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is an object of the instant invention to provide a camping assembly for van-type vehicles which permits the convenient assemblage to the side of the van-type vehicle.
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a camping assembly which, when stored, occupies a very small portion of the interior space of the vehicle.
Yet, another object of the instant invention is the provision of a camping assembly wherein the constituent elements are conveniently, yet, securely connected.
In accordance with the above designs, a skeletal structure is assembled to one side of a van-type vehicle and has as its primary elements a pair of parallel, main supporting members which are characterized by means clamping said members to the
roof rain gutter of the vehicle and the lower terminal portions of which are of claw shape and adapted to grasp the lower body part of the vehicle.  Auxiliary horizontal supporting members are telescopically assembled in oppositely disposed sleeves
connected to the main supporting members.  A preferred embodiment of the invention consists of an uppermost awning support member, a pair of intermediate cabinet support members and a lower table support member.  Outwardly spaced female channels are
connected to each of the horizontal supporting members and the various ammenities, namely, the cabinets, awning and the table; each include a male channel and each of which are adapted to be received in the respective mating female channels.  The
slidable engagement between the various elements is rather easily achieved so that assembly takes very little time.  Furthermore, storage of the equipment is most convenient since the skeletal structure, in the disassembled state, comprises six or more
tubular members, the table is of the folding type so that it consumes very little space, the awning is of similar characteristics, and the cabinets can be stored in the most convenient place in the interior of the vehicle.
The above and other objects of the present invention will be apparent as the description continues, and when read in conjunction with the appended drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 6--6 of FIG. 2 illustrating the means of connection to the roof rain gutter; and
FIG. 7 is a view taken along lines 7--7 of FIG. 2 illustrating the claw or lower terminal of the main support members. DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a van 10 which is similar in many respects to the Volkswagen van that is very popular in personal as well as commercial use.  The apparatus comprising the instant invention is connected to either side panel 12
of the vehicle at any convenient station along the surface thereof.  The only limitation in its placement, of course, would be in a position wherein it would block the door 14.  Since the vehicle is stationary when the apparatus is assembled, the fact
that it blocks one or more of the windows of the vehicle is immaterial.
FIG. 1 illustrates the three primary ammenities that are useful on a camping trip; a table 16 which includes legs 18, 20 that fold parallel to the table surface when it is not being used, a series of storage cabinets 22 which are assembled at a
central portion of the apparatus, and an awning 24 which provides shade and shelter for the immediate area.
FIG. 2 illustrates the nature of the skeletal structure to which the ammenities are connected.  All the various elements of the skeletal structure are hollow tubular type members in the nature of pipes depending for the most part on telescopic
joining to quickly and easily assemble the skeleton.  The main support for the skeleton is provided by a pair of elongated tubular members 30, 32 which are assembled along the entire height of the side 12 and which are affixed to the roof rain gutter 34
and the lower bottom part 36 of the vehicle.  At various stations along each main supporting member 30, 32 are sleeves 38a through 38f.  The sleeves are connected to the main supporting members so that they face inwardly or toward each other when the
skeleton is assembled to the vehicle.  Auxiliary, horizontal supporting members 40, 32, 44 and 46 are affixed to the skeleton and are designed to provide the support for the ammenities 16, 22 and 24.  Auxiliary member 40 has its tapered ends received in
sleeves 38a and 38f and is utilized in support of the cabinets 22.  Auxiliary member 42 is similarly connected in sleeves 38b and 38e and provides secondary support for the cabinet 22.  Auxiliary member 44 is also similarly received in sleeves 38c and
38d and supports the table 16.  The auxiliary member 46 is somewhat differently connected to the main support members 30, 32 in that it includes a pair of legs 50, 52 which are received in the upper openings of the main support members.  In this manner,
the awning 24 is disposed as high above the other ammenities as possible.
FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate the basic means of affixing the main support members 30, 32 to the vehicle.  In FIG. 6 there is shown an arm 54 which curves from a point spaced outwardly and above the roof rain gutter 34 to that gutter.  At the lower
terminus of the arm 54 is a fixed plate 56.  The roof rain gutter is shown as having several angled surfaces notably 58, 60 and 62.  A companion clamp 64 is profiled similar to the external surfaces of the roof rain gutter 34 and when connected thereto
provides for substantially complete surface contiguity.  A bolt 66 is received in aligned holes in plate 56 and clamp 64 and the components interact to squeeze the rain gutter between clamp 64 and plate 56.  The bolt 66 and wing nut 68 permit the ready
assembly and disassembly to the rain gutter 34 with little cumbersome manipulation.
To connect the main support member 30, 32 to the lower body part of the vehicle, the terminal end parts are formed as wedges or claws 70.  Those claws are adapted to grasp the lower body part at the same time the clamp 64 engages the rain gutter
34.
Turning to FIG. 3, we see illustrated the means by which table 16 is connected to the auxiliary support member 44.  A female channel 80 is affixed to that support member 44 and faces outwardly from the vehicle.  A male channel 82 is connected to
the inside edge of the table 16 and has its outer surface contoured similar to the inside surface contour of the female channel 80.  To assemble the table to the auxiliary support member 44, one merely inserts the male channel 82 into the female channel
80 and slides it therein until it reaches its normal assembled position.
FIG. 5 illustrates a similar arrangement for the cabinets 22 to the auxiliary support member 40, 42.  Auxiliary support member 40 includes a female channel 84 and a compatible male channel 86 and a sliding engagement is affected therebetween
similar to the engagement between channels 80 and 82 used to connect up the table 16.  The lower portion of the cabinets 22 include a spacer member 88 which rests against the auxiliary support member 42 and prevents the lower rear of the cabinet from
striking the auxiliary support member 42 and either damaging its casing or excessively agitating the contents of the cabinets.
FIG. 6 illustrates the mechanism responsible for connecting the awning 34 to the auxiliary support member 46.  A substantially circular channel 90 is affixed to the auxiliary support member 46 and a similarly contoured but smaller male channel 92
is slidably received within channel 90 much in the same way as the engagements were affected for the table and the cabinet.  In all the engagements, a pin may be utilized to affect a secure joinder between the ammenity and the auxiliary support member. 
These pins would be received in a pair of aligned holes formed in the male and female channels associated with each ammenity.
It should be evident that upon reaching the camp site, the camper removes the various supporting members and assembles them quickly and efficiently on the side of the van.  The ammenities are assembled with even greater facility and consequently
very little time is wasted assembling the camping gear permitting more time for recreational activities.  It should be obvious that any other ammenity that may be of use in such a trip may be similarly assembled but all such conveniences need not be
specifically described for the purposes of this application.  The present invention converts a multi-purpose vehicle to recreational use without expensive or permanent alterations thereto.
Many changes may be made in details of the instant invention, in the method and materials of fabrication, in the configuration and assemblage of the constituent elements, without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims, which
changes are intended to be embraced therewithin.

openings are provided into the spaces or cavities between these panels as, for example, for the retraction of a window or to provide accessibility to mechanisms used between these panels.  Since water can enter through these openings, one or more drain
holes are provided in the lower portions of one of the panels to permit the escape of water.  These drain holes also serve a function during the construction of the vehicle body to permit the drainage of paint or other rust preventing coating materials
used during the assembly of the vehicle.  To permit the escape of water from the drain trough formed at the pinch weld area of these panels through these openings while limiting or preventing dust or other ambient material from entering the space between
these panels, various sealing plug means have been used to partly close these drain hole openings.
Although a number of these seal drain plugs have been used with satisfactory results, all of the prior known drain plugs have either been expensive to fabricate and/or expensive to install.
It is therefore a primary object of this invention to provide an improved drain plug, for partially enclosing the drain hole opening in a vehicle body, which can be manufactured inexpensively of sheet material and which can readily be installed
into the drain opening without the use of special tools.
Another object of this invention is to provide a one-piece drain plug for a drain hole of a vehicle body which can be readily inserted into the drain hole and clinched in place and which will allow drainage from the drain hole in any installed
position.
A still further object of this invention is to provide an improved drain plug which is adaptable for partially enclosing a drain hole opening of any desired configuration.
These and other objects of the invention are obtained by means of a drain plug of cross-shaped configuration with two crossed arms, one arm of which is provided with a fold line to permit folding of the plug whereby the extent between the other
arm is reduced to permit entry of this arm into a drain hole opening after which the plug can be clinched into position to unfold the first arm whereby this arm engages one side of the panel and, whereby the other arm is forced to move into engagement
with the other side of the panel. For a better understanding of the invention, as well as other objects and further features thereof, reference is had to the following detailed description of the invention to be read in connection with the
accompanying drawings, wherein:
FIG. 1 is a partial sectional view of the quarter panel of a vehicle body provided with a drain plug, in accordance with the invention, to partly seal a drain hole opening in the inner panel of this assembly;
FIG. 2 is a view of the drain plug of FIG. 1 shown in its form during installation into the drain hole opening;
FIG. 3 is a sectional view taken along line 3--3 of FIG. 2;
FIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 2 but showing the plug in its installed position partially closing the drain hole opening;
FIG. 5 is a sectional view taken along line 5--5 of FIG. 4; and,
FIG. 6 is a perspective view of the drain plug, in accordance with the invention, showing the plug in its pre-installed free position. Referring now to the drawings, a vehicle body, generally designated 10, includes an outer body, such as
a rear quarter panel 12, and an inner body or filler panel 14, which together define a well or cavity 16, the upper edges of the panels 12 and 14 are spaced apart and therefore water can enter and accumulate within the cavity 16.  One or more drain hole
openings 18 are provided in the inner panel 14, adjacent to the pinch weld joining the lower ends of the panels together, to permit draining of any water which may accumulate within the cavity 16 between these panels.
A drain plug 20, in accordance with the invention, is mounted within the opening 18 to permit the water to drain through this opening to the exterior of the vehicle body, the drain plug also preventing or limiting ambient material, such as mud,
or dust, from entering into the well 16 through the drain opening.
The drain plug 20, in accordance with the invention, is made of relatively thin material suitable for the environment in which it is to be used on a motor vehicle.  Drain plug 20 formed, for example, as a sheet metal stamped blank, is in the
configuration of a Greek cross with two sets of arms 22 and 24 crossing at their midpoints and substantially normal to each other, with the length of each arm being substantially greater than the diameter of the drain hole 18.
The drain plug, in its pre-installed free position, that is, in its form for insertion into the drain hole 18, the form as seen in FIGS. 2, 3 and 6, has the arm 22 initially bent along a central longitudinal fold line 26 to form, in effect, two
arm portions 22a and 22b integrally hinged together about the fold line 26 and partially folded toward each other on one side, the body panel facing side, of the drain plug, the two arm portions, as thus folded, appearing tent-like in cross section.  The
portions at the opposite ends of arm 24, adjacent to the longitudinal sides of arm 22, are also each bent along fold lines 28 on opposite sides and adjacent to the arm 24 in the same direction as the arm portions 22a and 22b and in a direction toward
each other.  The free end portions of the opposite ends of arm 24 each terminate in a return bent flange 24a, with the return bent flange 24a portion of each end portion of an arm 24 extending in an opposite direction from the other return bent flange
24a, that is, these return bent flanges are outwardly directed away from the portion of the arm 24 directly adjacent to the arm 22.  These opposite end portions of arm 24 may be considered, as will become apparent, as clamp arms extending laterally from
the arm portions 22a and 22b of arm 22 whereby a body panel can be clinched between the opposite end portions of arm 24 and the arm 22.
In the above described pre-installed configuration of the drain plug 20, the extent between the free ends of the return bent flanges 24a of the arm 24 is substantially equal to or less than the diameter of the drain hole 18 to permit insertion of
the arm 24 of the drain plug into the drain hole 18 with very little additional folding of the drain plug or biasing together of the return bent flange portions 24a of the arm 24.  Thus, in its pre-installed configuration, the drain plug 20 is bent into
a tent-like cross section so that two ends of its oppositely positioned arm 24 will easily pass through the drain hole and two ends of arm 22 will not pass through the drain hole.
In the assembly of the drain plug to the vehicle body panel in a position to substantially close the drain hole opening 18, the end portions of the arm 24 are inserted through the drain hole opening 18 so that the drain plug is positioned
relative to the vehicle body panel 14, as shown in FIG. 3.  To clinch the drain plug into position, it is then necessary to collapse the tent-like configuration of the arm 22 to the position of this arm, as best seen in FIG. 5, as by striking it with a
suitable flat tool, such as a hammer, in the area of the fold line 26 in a direction toward the inner panel 14, the direction shown by arrow A in FIG. 3.  When the drain plug is thus struck, the two arm portions 22a and 22b will flatten out so that both
portions lie substantially flat in a common plane and are in engagement with the outer side of inner panel 14 and, at the same time, the two portions of arm 24 which were passed through the drain hole are now forced to move radially out beyond the
extremities of the drain hole and dig into the underside of the panel, and the free end portions of the return bent flanges thereof dig into the inner side of the inner panel 14.  By providing the transverse free ends of the return bent flanges 24a with
a curved configuration, for example, the semi-circular configuration in the preferred embodiment shown, the midpoints of these transverse ends of the return bent flanges 24a will first engage the inner surface of inner panel 14 to move readily dig into
this panel, since their contact will be substantially point contact with this panel.  It is apparent that other transverse end shapes may be used to provide point contact in lieu of line contact between these edges and the panel.
In the embodiment of the drain plug 20 shown, as fitted into a circular drain opening 18, this drain plug will substantially cover the drain hole opening 18, only relatively small portions 18a of the hole being left uncovered adjacent to the four
intersecting corners of the arms 22 and 24, as seen in FIG. 4.  By proper sizing of the drain plug 20 relative to the hole 18, these open portions 18a of the drain hole will be large enough to permit water to drain from the cavity 16 while limiting to
within acceptable limits the entry of ambient material into the cavity 16.  In addition, the drain plug 20 will allow water drainage through the drain hole 18 in any assembled position of this drain plug into the drain hole of the inner panel.
Although the drain plug 20 has been shown as applied to substantially cover a drain hole 18 of circular configuration, it should be realized that by properly dimensioning the length and width of the arms 22 and 24, this drain plug can be used to
substantially seal any suitable shaped drain hole opening in a vehicle body panel, such as a square, rectangular or oval opening.
As previously described, the drain plug 20 of the invention can be made of any suitable material which can be deformed in the manner described above and which is suitable for the environment in which this drain plug is to be used, as in a motor
vehicle.  Thus, the drain plug can be made of aluminum, copper or steel, it being realized that the material out of which the drain plug is made can be zinc plated, painted or otherwise treated, if necessary, to permit the particular body material of the
drain plug to withstand the environment for a particular application of the drain plug.

",,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The use of vinyl and other decorative plastic covering materials on automobile roof tops to enhance the aesthetic appearance thereof is well known and in widespread use.  A large variety of different techniques have heretofore been proposed for
installing such decorative covering materials in an effort to reduce cost and to further assure that the covering material after installation is adherent over substantially the entire surface of the panel and is devoid of any bubbles, wrinkles or other
areas of poor fit or surface imperfections.  A further problem associated with such prior art techniques has been the large number of man-hours required in preparing a vehicle for reception of a decorative roof covering, as well as the time and number of
persons required for the installation of the cover and the trimming thereof along the periphery of the panel.  Such techniques have also required a high degree of precaution to avoid damage or marring of other exterior surfaces of the automobile to avoid
the cost and nuisance of subjecting the vehicle to spot repair or rework to correct such damage.
Typically, the process heretofore employed for applying decorative plastic covering materials such as vinyl to automobile roof tops has involved the cutting of a rectangular blank of the material of a size in excess of the area of the panel to be
covered.  In those instances in which it is known that a vehicle is to be equipped with a vinyl roof, the final finish coat of paint is omitted and the primed roof panel is coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive in a manner so as to avoid any air
entrapment therein.  This requires a complete masking of the adjacent body panels and windows to avoid the deposition of adhesive thereon which, in some instances, adversely reacts with the paint finish.  The underside of the vinyl covering material is
also coated with the pressure sensitive adhesive.
In order to avoid premature bonding of the covering material to the coated roof panel, slip sheets are normally interposed between the covering material and roof panel to enable a hand-positioning and location of the covering material, whereafter
the slip sheets are withdrawn and the covering material is hand-smoothened and worked into an adherent and shape-conforming covering.  Thereafter, the terminal edge portions of the covering material are trimmed, producing costly scrap, and finally the
masking material and any oversprayed adhesive are cleaned from the adjoining uncovered surfaces of the vehicle.
It will be apparent from the foregoing that the process constitutes a costly and time-consuming operation and also has a tendency to cause possible damage to other sections of the vehicle.  In accordance with the decorative covering material and
method comprising the present invention, a prefabricated and stretched decorative covering material can be provided which can be simply applied and secured along its terminal edges to a vehicle panel and thereafter shrunk and bonded in the form of a
smooth and taut covering without requiring any trimming thereby substantially reducing the quantity of scrap produced in the installation of such decorative materials.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The benefits and advantages of the present invention are achieved in the provision of a decorative covering material comprised of a plastic sheet composed of a heat-softenable material, such as a vinyl plastic, for example, and having a
heat-activatable adhesive film over substantially the entire underside surface thereof.  The covering material may be comprised of a single unitary sheet or, alternatively, may be comprised of two or more sections joined to each other to form a
pretrimmed assembly of a preselected size and shape and including fastening means along at least a portion of the terminal edges thereof for securing the covering material in appropriate alignment over a vehicle panel to prevent movement of the covering
material relative to the panel during the assembly operation.  The covering material is further characterized as being provided with a convex contour over at least the central inner area thereof which incorporates residual stresses or a memory, whereby a
shrinkage of the covering material is effected in response to a heating thereof to a temperature at which the sheet is plastically deformable.
In its method aspects, the present invention contemplates the installation of a composite pretrimmed covering material, as hereinabove described, by accurately locating the covering material on a roof panel and thereafter applying heat to the
covering material effecting a shrinkage thereof into a smooth form-fitting covering which, in response to the activation of the adhesive film on the underside thereof, also forms a tenacious bond, assuring a durable high-strength assembly.  The method
further contemplates the fabrication of the composite pretrimmed covering material. Additional benefits and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon a reading of the description of the preferred embodiments taken in
conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Referring now in detail to the drawings, and as may be best seen in FIG. 1, a decorative vinyl covering material 10 is illustrated as applied to the roof panel and the exterior faces of the windshield ""A"" pillar posts 12 of a conventional
two-door hardtop sedan 14.  It will be appreciated that the composite pretrimmed covering material and the method of installation are equally applicable for use in alternative vehicle design configurations including other exterior or interior panels or
sections thereof as may be desired in carrying out any desired decorative scheme.
The decorative covering material 10, as best seen in FIG. 5, is comprised of a plastic facing sheet 16, which may be composed of any plastic material which is of a thermoplastic or pseudo-thermoplastic character, enabling a heat-softening thereof
at moderate temperatures, and which, moreover, is resistant to weather and ultraviolet light, providing for a long, useful life.  It is important that the facing sheet be possessed of a heat-softening temperature above that at which it may normally
become heated during use, such as may be encountered during the parking of a vehicle in direct exposure to the hot sunlight.  Heat-softening temperatures of above about 200.degree.F., are usually satisfactory for the vast majority of automobile exposure
situations, whereby the facing sheet retains a sufficient degree of strength and abrasion and impact resistance to provide for satisfactory service.  On the other hand, the heat-softening point of the facing sheet should not be excessively high since it
is desirable, in many instances, to apply the decorative covering material to an automobile which, in all other respects, is substantially completely finished, and the use of excessively high temperatures at this stage of manufacture might result in
damage or injury to other trim materials and functional components.  Generally, heat-softening points of less than about 300.degree.F., have been found satisfactory for use in conventional automobile assembly operations since the short duration of
heating required in the practice of the process comprising the present invention frequently does not permit other components immediately adjacent to the roof panel to attain a temperature approaching that to which the decorative covering material is
heated.
Facing sheets comprised of synthetic plastic materials which are possessed of the foregoing physical properties or which incorporate suitable plasticizers and/or filler agents to modify the physical properties within the desired range can be
satisfactorily employed for this purpose, of which vinyl-type facing sheets are particularly satisfactory.  Among such vinyl plastics are those designated by the brand name ""Naugahyde,"" obtainable from United States Rubber Company, and by the brand name
""Fabrilite,"" available from the DuPont de Nemours Company.  Such vinyl facing sheets are further characterized as being available in a variety of widths and in indefinite lengths and can be further provided with a suitable embossed pattern such as a
simulated leather graining on one or both face surfaces thereof.
While such vinyl facing sheets can be satisfactorily employed in an unsupported condition, it is preferred to employ facing sheets having a knitted fabric backing 18, as shown in FIG. 5, which is bonded or otherwise interlocked with and to the
underside surface of the facing sheet.  Knitted fabric-backed vinyl facing sheets having a grained exterior face surface and having a weight of from about 14 to about 24 ounces per square yard have been found particularly satisfactory for forming durable
and weather-resistant decorative covering materials for exterior automobile panels.
A suitable coating or layer 20 of a heat-activatable adhesive is applied over substantially the entire underside surface of the facing sheet directly to the fabric backing 18 or, alternatively, over an intervening barrier coating or film 22.  The
use of a barrier coating 22 is desirable in some instances to prevent or inhibit undesired migration of constituents to and from the adhesive film to the exterior surface of the facing sheet 16, which may produce a discoloration or other surface
imperfection therein.  The barrier coating 22 may also serve as a so-called tie-coat for enhancing the strength of the initial or final bond of the adhesive coating to the underside of the facing sheet.  The barrier coating may comprise any suitable
natural or synthetic base resinous or plastic material which may additionally include suitable filler materials, as may be desired, that in combination are compatible with the facing sheet and the adhesive layer as well as being resistant to the
temperatures to which the decorative covering material is subjected during fabrication and installation.
The adhesive coating or film 20 is comprised of a heat-activatable substance such that the film itself is latent until it is heated to an elevated threshold temperature at which it becomes tacky and thereafter is adapted to adhesively bond to the
underlying substrate.  For this purpose, the temperature at which the adhesive film is activated is preferably one which is above the initial heat-softening point of the facing sheet so as to enable an initial heating of the facing sheet to the
appropriate temperature without incurring any tackifying of the adhesive film, permitting freedom of relative movement between the covering material and the surface of the panel during the installation.  After the covering material has been appropriately
smoothened and shrunk into a contour-fitting taut overlying layer, a further heating of the covering material thereafter effects a tackification and subsequent activation of the adhesive film, where, upon subsequent cooling, a tenacious bond is obtained.
The heat-activatable adhesive film is usually applied in the form of a coating or layer ranging from about 0.002 to about 0.035 inch and, more usually, from about 0.003 to about 0.010 inch thick.  The composition of the adhesive film itself may
comprise any heat-responsive material which, after being heated above a threshold temperature, heat softens and/or tackifies such that upon subsequent cooling and hardening thereof, a tenacious, substantially permanent-type bond is formed.  Thermoplastic
or pseudo-thermoplastic materials, including modified polyamide resins, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, and polyester-type resins having heat-softening and tackifying characteristics at temperatures usually about 30.degree.F., above the initial
heat-softening point of the facing sheet, can be satisfactorily employed for this purpose.
The adhesive film 20 can be applied to the underside of the facing sheet, either by a direct film extrusion technique, by casting the film in the form of a molten curtainous stream directly on the rear surface, or, alternatively, by applying a
powdered layer which, upon subsequent heating, is fused into a substantially continuous film of uniform thickness.  In any event, during the storage and shipment of the composite pretrimmed covering material, it is frequently desirable to prevent any
inadvertent adherence between adjacent layers when stacked one upon another, whereby it is usually preferred to employ a release liner, indicated at 24 in FIG. 5, which overlies substantially the entire face of the adhesive film.  The release liner may
comprise any suitable filmlike material including papers incorporating silicon-base release agents and waxes which are not adherent to the adhesive film and can readily be stripped therefrom prior to installation of the covering material without
incurring any offsetting of the adhesive film.
Referring now to FIG. 2 of the drawings, a typical process is schematically illustrated in which a supply roll 26 of a suitable fabric-backed facing sheet 28 is continuously unwound and is advanced around a roll 29 in a substantially horizontal
direction through an oven 30 having a coating assembly 32 mounted adjacent to the output end thereof.  The coating assembly 32 is operative to apply a suitable hot melt adhesive film to the underside surface of the facing sheet 28, whereafter, upon
exiting from the oven 30, it is cooled and a suitable release liner 34, supplied in the form of a roll 36, is applied by means of a nip roll 38 in overlying relationship on the exposed face of the adhesive film.  The resultant adhesively-coated facing
sheet can be wound on a suitable take-up roll 40 for storage prior to the next processing operation or, alternatively, can be continuously advanced between the jaws of a die-cutting apparatus 42 in which blanks or sections 44 of an appropriate size and
shape are cut in a manner to minimize trim scrap.
In accordance with the foregoing arrangement, a variety of sections of different shapes can be successively or simultaneously die-cut from the continuous web of facing material, which thereafter can be assembled, as is best seen in FIG. 3, into a
roof liner 46.  The roof liner 46, as shown, comprises two side sections 48 and a center section 49.  A pair of elongated sections 50 are secured to the forward edges of the side sections 49 which are adapted to overlie the windshield pillar posts 12 as
shown in FIG. 1 of the drawings.  An arcuate strip 52 is also affixed to and extends between the rearward portion of the side sections 48 and is adapted to cover that portion of the roof panel immediately below the rear window of the vehicle.  The
joining of the various sections to each other can be satisfactorily achieved by utilizing simulated or actual stitching, such as represented by te stitching 54 of FIG. 6 by which the edge of the center section 49 is joined to the edge of one of the side
sections 48.  In accordance with a preferred practice, the preliminarily sewn seams are subsequently dielectrically bonded to form a strong water-proof decorative seam.
In order to facilitate a location and a fastening of the roof liner 46 along its terminal edges to the roof panel to prevent relative movement thereof during installation, elongated resilient plastic strips 56, as best seen in FIGS. 3, 5 and 7,
are secured along at least a portion of the edges of the roof liner.  The fastening strips 56 are of a hook-shaped cross section and are adapted to overlie and engage a metal drip rail 58 disposed along the side edges of the roof panel and downwardly
along the rearward edge of the side window.  Preferably, the fastening strips 56 are comprised of an extruded vinyl plastic and are dielectrically bonded or otherwise adhesively secured to the underside of the edge portions of the roof liner.  In
addition to the fastening strips 56, supplemental fastening devices, including staples, double-face pressure sensitive adhesive tapes, screws, garnish moldings and the like, can be employed for securing the edge portions of the roof liner during its
installation on the roof panel of an automobile.
The roof liner 46 is shown in FIG. 3 in a fully-assembled and flat condition.  After attaining this stage of assembly, the roof liner is subjected to a heat stretching operation to impart a convex contour therein of a magnitude in excess of the
contour of the convex roof panel over which it is to be applied.  The contour is imparted to the roof liner in a manner to leave a residual stress or memory, tending to cause the liner to again return to a flat or original configuration upon a reheating
thereof to a heat-softening point.  A convenient manner for imparting a contour in at least the central inner area of the roof liner, involves the use of a mold arrangement as shown in FIG. 4.  As shown, the roof 46 is adapted to be clamped along its
edges between an overlying frame 60 and a flange 62 of a mold 64 defining a contoured cavity 66.  The inner mold surface 68 is of a generally porous structure including ports 70 which are adapted to be disposed in communication with a vacuum chamber 72
connected to a vacuum pump 74 for drawing the roof liner down when in a heat-softened condition.
A heating of the roof liner 46 is achieved such as by a bank of heat lamps 76, which are directed against the rear surface of the roof liner with the exterior facing sheet thereof oriented downwardly toward the mold surface 68.  Upon an
appropriate heating of the roof liner to a temperature such as from about 230.degree.F., to about 275.degree.F., and preferably from about 240.degree.F., to about 250.degree.F., in combination with vacuum, a convex contouring of the central section of
the roof liner occurs, whereafter the bank of heat lamps is extinguished.  A suitable cooling fluid is circulated through conduits 78 disposed adjacent to the mold surface, whereby the roof liner is immediately cooled upon coming in contact therewith to
a temperature below its heat-softening point, thereby retaining at least a portion of the contouring therein after a release of the vacuum.
The assembled and contoured roof liner can be stored indefinitely until such time it is to be installed and at which time the release liner is removed from the underside surface thereof and the liner is applied in overlying relationship on a roof
panel, such as the roof panel 80 shown in FIG. 7.  The roof liner is of a size in excess of that required with due allowance of the shrinkability of the liner upon again being reheated to the heat-softening point.  An appropriate location and fastening
of the terminal edge portions of the liner are achieved such as by the fastening strips 56 applied in engagement over the drip roll 58, whereafter a chrome-plated garnish molding 82 is secured such as by means of screws 84 as shown in FIG. 7 securely
locking the edges of the roof liner in place.  Supplemental fastening of edges in sections such as the elongated sections 50 and the arcuate strip 52 (FIG. 3), can be achieved by staples or double-faced pressure sensitive adhesive tape to prevent
relative movement of the edges during the subsequent heating step.
With the roof liner in appropriate fastened position on the vehicle roof panel, heating of the exterior face sheet is effected such as by means of a bank of heat lamps similar to that shown in FIG. 4, whereupon the residual stresses or memory in
the sheet effects a progressive shrinkage thereof to form a smooth and taut shape-conforming covering layer.  Continued heating of the roof liner effects a further increase in its temperature and an activation of the adhesive film on the underside
thereof which becomes tacky and effects a bonding of the liner to the underlying roof panel.  Upon removal of the heat and a subsequent cooling of the roof panel and liner, the adhesive bond rigidifies, forming an integral high-strength and durable
assembly.
While it will be apparent that the invention herein disclosed is well calculated to achieve the benefits and advantages as herein above set forth, it will be appreciated that the invention is susceptible to modification, variation and change
without departing from the spirit thereof.

This invention relates to a tonneau cover and more particularly to a tonneau cover for use on fifth wheel camper trucks.
Fifth wheel camper trucks are becoming more and more popular due to the expansion of the recreational vehicle industry.  The fifth wheel camper trucks ordinarily have a fifth wheel positioned in the box while the trailer has a king pin extending
downwardly from the forward end thereof which is connected to the fifth wheel.
Since the truck box is not covered in conventional fifth wheel camper trucks, light objects will be blown therefrom or will become wet if it should rain.  Further, wind resistance builds up in the truck box which decreases gas mileage.
Therefore, it is a principal object of this invention to provide a tonneau cover for fifth wheel camper trucks.
A further object of the invention is to provide a tonneau cover for fifth wheel camper trucks which includes a supporting frame secured to the truck box.
A further object of the invention is to provide a tonneau cover for a fifth wheel camper truck which prevents objects in the truck from being blown therefrom or becoming wet.
A further object of the invention is to provide a tonneau cover for fifth wheel camper trucks including means for closing the opening through which the king pin of the trailer normally extends.
A further object of the invention is to provide a tonneau cover for fifth wheel camper trucks which may be removed from the truck or installed thereon without disconnecting the truck from the trailer.
A further object of the invention is to provide a tonneau cover for fifth wheel camper trucks which is economical of manufacture and durable in use and refined in appearance.
These and other objects will be apparent to those skilled in the art. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
This invention consists in the construction, arrangements and combination of the various parts of the device, whereby the objects contemplated are attained as hereinafter more fully set forth, specifically pointed out in the claims, and
illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which:
FIG. 1 is a side view of a conventional fifth wheel camper truck pulling a trailer:
FIG. 2.  is an exploded perspective view of the tonneau cover of this invention:
FIG. 3 is an enlarged fragmentary sectional view seen on lines 3--3 of FIG. 2; and
FIG. 4 is an exploded perspective view of the supporting frame for the tonneau cover and its relationship with the truck box. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
The numeral 10 refers generally to a fifth wheel trailer having a king pin 12 extending downwardly from the lower forward end thereof.  The numeral 14 refers to a conventional fifth wheel camper truck generally including a box 16 and a fifth
wheel mechanism 18 mounted therein.  Box 16 comprises a pair of spaced apart side walls 20 and 22, front wall 24 and tail gate 26.
The tonneau cover of this invention is referred to generally by the reference number 28 and includes the supporting frame 30 seen in FIG. 4.  Support frame 30 comprises a pair of side frame members 32 and 34 having a front frame member 36 secured
to and extending between the forward ends thereof.  A rear frame member 38 is detachably secured to the rearward ends of the side frame members 32 and 34 by means of pins 40 as illustrated in FIG. 4.  A plurality of cross frame members 42 are secured to
and extend between the side frame members 32 and 34 by any conventional means.  As seen in the drawings, the cross frame members are arched so that the centers dwell in a plane above the ends to aid in draining water from the cover.  The supporting frame
30 is provided with a plurality of snap fasteners 44 as seen in FIG. 4 to permit the cover 28 to be secured thereto.  Supporting frame 30 is secured to the box 16 by means of bolts 46 as illustrated in FIG. 4.
Cover 28 is preferably constructed of a vinyl material with twill backing so as to achieve the necessary flexibility and strength.  Cover 28 is provided with downwardly extending flap portions 48 provided at the periphery thereof including snap
fasteners 50 adapted to be secured to the snap fasteners 44.  As seen in FIG. 2, the flap portions are provided with end portions 52 which may be secured to the adjacent flap portion to affect a water tight seal at the corners of the cover.
Cover 28 is provided with an opening 54 as illustrated in FIG. 2.  The numeral 56 refers to an upstanding support in the form of belting or the like which is secured to the cover and which extends around the opening 54 as illustrated in the
drawings.  A plurality of snap fasteners 58 are provided on the upstanding member 56 to permit the cap 60 to be secured thereto by means of the snap fastners 62 provided thereon.  As seen in FIG. 3, cap 60 is provided with downwardly extending side
portions which receive the upstanding support 56.  A zipper extends from the opening 54 to the rearward end of the cover for a purpose to be described in more detail hereinafter.
The supporting frame 30 is installed on the vehicle as previously described.  As also previously described, frame member 38 is detachably connected to the side frame members 32 and 34 and it is preferred that the two cross frame members 42 at the
rear of the supporting frame 30 also be quickly detachably connected to the side frame members 32 and 34 so that the supporting frame 30 can be mounted on the box without the necessity of disconnecting the trailer from a truck.  In other words, the
supporting frame 30 could be slipped beneath the forward end of the trailer and positioned on the box with the two rear cross frame members 42 and the rear frame member 38 then being connected to the supporting frame.
Cover 28 is simply secured to the supporting frame 30 by means of the snap fasteners as previously described.  If the trailer is connected to the truck, zipper 64 is opened to permit the cover to be slipped around the downwardly extending king
pin 12.  The upstanding member 56 is closely positioned beneath the lower forward portion of the trailer and prevents moisture from entering the box.  When the trailer is not connected to the truck, the cap 60 may be secured to the upstanding members 56
to seal the opening 54.
Thus it can be seen that a unique tonneau cover has been provided for a fifth wheel camper truck which prevents objects in the truck box from becoming wet or from becoming blown therefrom.  The tonneau cover of this invention also prevents wind
resistance from building up in the truck box.  Thus it can be seen that the tonneau cover of this invention accomplishes at leat all of its stated objectives.

A reinforced motor vehicle door for protecting a motor vehicle against lateral impact comprising:
spaced apart main door panels forming inner and outer walls of the motor vehicle door and secured to rigid door frame members;
protecting means mounted on said frame members disposed between said main door panels for imparting lateral protection to the motor vehicle door, said protecting means including a structure comprising a rigid strip having inner and outer walls
and which is in the form of a sleeve having an oval-like longitudinal cross-section and mounted on the motor vehicle door for pivotal movement therewith with said longitudinal axis oriented essentially parallel to the general longitudinal direction of
the motor vehicle, a core in reinforcing engagement with said inner walls of said rigid strip and a peripheral winding of filamentary material about said core constituting said rigid strip and comprising resin impregnated glass fibers under tension, said
peripheral winding being composed of approximately 50 to 80% glass yarn and the remainder resin.
2.  The reinforced motor vehicle door according to claim 1, characterized in that said core is formed with rigid or semi-rigid foam having a density of 50 to 200 grams per liter.
3.  The reinforced motor vehicle door according to claim 1, characterized in that said core comprises a lost core consisting of a reinforced glass-fiber material impregnated with setting resin and molded to a zig-zag or cellular configuration.
4.  The reinforced motor vehicle of claim 1 wherein said peripheral winding is composed of 70% glass yarn.
5.  The reinforced motor vehicle door of claim 2 wherein said foam is selected from the group consisting of polyurethane, PVC and a self-setting resin composition containing a filler or reinforcing agents.
6.  The reinforced motor vehicle door of claim 1 wherein said core is a detachable core.
7.  The reinforced motor vehicle door of claim 1 wherein said rigid strip is essentially ellipsoidally shaped.
8.  The reinforced motor vehicle door of claim 1 wherein said transverse axis of said rigid strip is oriented essentially perpendicularly to the planes of said main door panels.  ",,"The
present invention relates in general to means for improving the lateral protection of motor vehicles, and is directed more particularly to a device for improving the protection of the side doors of such vehicles.
It is already known in the field of technical measures taken for improving the lateral protection of a motor vehicle in case of side crash to incorporate in the lateral doors of vehicles, behind the outer pressed door panels, lateral reinforcing
members consisting of shaped metal plates.  The use of these reinforcing members improved considerably the lateral protection of conventional motor vehicles by preventing any deep and dangerous penetration of one portion of another vehicle into the
passenger compartment of the thus protected vehicle, for instance in case of a crash approximately at right angles between the two vehicles.
However, these known reinforcing elements consisting of shaped metal plates, although relatively effective, are objectionable on account of their considerable weight, which increases greatly the total weight of the vehicle if a protection of this
character is used extensively throughout the vehicle.
Reinforcing elements in the form of strips tension stressed in planes substantially parallel to the door panels and consisting of a texture of synthetic material treated to cause its contraction are also known.  However, the mechanical properties
of these energy-absorbing devices are rather limited.
It is the essential object of the present invention to avoid the above-mentioned inconveniences while providing a considerable lateral protection at a low cost and without resorting to relatively heavy component elements.
According to this invention, the lateral protection device for motor vehicles, notably for the lateral doors of vehicles, is intended for fitting between the panel elements consituting each door and characterised in that it has a structure in the
form of a rigid continuous strip in the form of an oval-like sleeve member secured parallel to said panels in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and anchored to the vertical edges of the door, said structure comprising a core and a peripheral
winding of glass yarn coated with resin and kept under tension stress, the proportions of said component elements being preferably in the range of about 70 % glass yarn, the balance consisting of resin. Other features and advantages of this
invention will appear as the following description proceeds with reference to the attached drawing, illustrating a typical embodiment of the invention.  In the drawing:
FIG. 1 is a general perspective view of a vehicle door reinforced according to the present invention;
FIG. 2 illustrates a typical reinforcing element;
FIGS. 3 and 4 are sections taken along the transverse and longitudinal planes, respectively, of the reinforcing element, showing a detail thereof, and
FIG. 5 illustrates a detail of the energy absorber according to this invention, shown in fragmentary cross-sectional view. The vehicle door illustrated in FIG. 1 comprises essentially a pair of panels 1 and 2 between which the reinforcing
element of the present invention is disposed.  This element, as shown more in detail in FIG. 2, comprises a sleeve member 3 extending parallel to the panels in the general longitudinal direction of the vehicle.  It is anchored to the vertical edges of
the door by means of studs 4 and brackets 8.
The reinforcing elements according to the present invention are obtained as follows:
According to a first embodiment of the invention there is provided, a lost core of thermoplastic or thermosetting reinforced material such as a pre-impregnated material consisting of reinforcing fibres, for instance glass fibers, comprising a
synthetic resin, such as polyesters or epoxy resins.
The shape of this core must be designed to enable it to partake in the stiffness of the element; to this end, it is given a zig-zag configuration or a cellular configuration obtained beforehand by moulding, as illustrated at 5 in FIGS. 2, 3 and
4.
On this core 5 a filament winding 6 is formed by using a yarn 10 under tension, this yarn being impregnated with polymerizable synthetic resin similar to those mentioned hereinabove, and subsequently set.
In a modified embodiment of the invention (FIG. 5), the core consists either of a lost core of relatively light construction, of which the only function is to permit the filament winding, or a detachable core, possibly expansible to facilitate
the stripping (for example in the form of a plurality of stainless-steel sections, or inflatable sections of rubberized fabric coated with silicones) on which, as in the preceding example, a filament winding 6 of glass yarn impregnated with polymerizable
resin is formed and eventually set.
Then, while preserving the lost core or removing the detachable core, the cavity thus obtained is filled with a material 7 forming a rigid or semi-rigid foam, such as polyurethane or polyvinylchloride (PVC), or self-hardening resins containing a
filler such as mineral or organic powders, or semi-finished fillers such as expanded fillers, glass balls, etc .  . . .
By way of example, a structure obtained by applying the filament-winding method by means of E-grade glass yarn having a diameter of 8 to 14.mu., is filled with rigid polyurethane having a density approximating 50 to 200 gramms per liter, by
reason of 70 % of glass fibres and 30 % of catalysed resin.  The element has the following direction:
Total length : 80 centimeters  Total thickness : 5 cm  Strip width : 8.5 cm  Strip thickness : 0.4 cm.
This structure, submitted to shock tests, is capable of absorbing 1,250 Joules (29,630 ft.pdl) and withstanding a pressure of 50,000 N (362,000 poundals) with a 50-mm sag.
Although a specific form of embodiment of this invention has been described hereinabove and illustrated in the accompanying drawing, it will readily occur to those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes may be brought thereto
without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.

relates to a wheeled vehicle of the kind including a wheel carrying axle, the load carrying portion of the vehicle being carried by resilient or non-resilient supports which are clamped to the axle and there being interposed between the supports and the
axle, force sensing elements operable to provide an electrical signal indicative of the load transmitted to the axle by the supports.
With the above arrangement, each element is subjected to the force arising due to the weight of the load carrying portion of the vehicle and its load, as well as the clamping force required to clamp the support to the axle.  This latter force is
substantial, and as a result the sensitivity of the sensing element to variations in the load carried by the load carrying portion of the vehicle is reduced.
The object of the invention is to provide a wheeled vehicle of the kind specified in a simple and convenient form.
According to the invention, in a vehicle of the kind specified there is provided in association with each support, a further force sensing element which is positioned so as to be subjected only to the clamping force clamping the support to the
axle, the first mentioned element and the further element being electrically connected so that the resultant signal is dependent only upon the force transmitted to the axle by the support. Examples of wheeled vehicles in accordance with the
invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which show a portion only of the vehicle, and in which;
FIG. 1 is a sectional side elevation taken through the vehicle axle of one example,
FIG. 2 shows a modification of the example shown in FIG. 2, the view being taken at right angles to that of FIG. 1,
FIG. 3 shows an electrical circuit diagram,
FIG. 4 is a plan view taken on the line 4--4 of FIG. 1, and
FIGS. 5-8 inclusive are views similar to FIG. 1 showing modifications. Referring to FIG. 1 of the drawings, there is provided a multi-leaf vehicle spring 10 of conventional construction, and in addition an axle 11 having a hollow
rectangular section.  Upper and lower mounting plates 12, 13 are provided for engagement with the axle, and these are recessed in known manner to locate upon the axle.  Also provided are substantially flat spacing plates 14, 15.
There is additionally provided a pair of U bolts 16, 17 the limbs of which extend through suitably positioned apertures in the spacing plates and mounting plates.  The U bolts extend over the spring 10 and the free ends thereof are threaded and
receive clamping nuts 18.  Surrounding the limbs of the U bolts and interposed between the spacing plates and the mounting plates are sensing elements which are of annular form.  The elements are referenced A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. Each sensing element
is provided with a resistive element, and the resistive elements are connected as seen in FIG. 3, in a bridge circuit.  The resistive elements of the sensing elements between the spacing plate 14 and the mounting plate 12 and which are subjected to the
load carried by the vehicle, the weight of the vehicle and the clamping force on the spring 10 are connected in opposite arms of the bridge circuit to the resistive elements of the sensing elements which are disposed between the spacing plate 15 and the
mounting plate 13, the latter sensing elements only being subjected to the clamping force of the spring.  As is the usual practice, the bridge circuit has a pair of electrical input terminals 19 which in use, are connected to a source of electric supply
not shown and a pair of output terminals 20, which in use, are connected to an indicating instrument.
In the arrangement which is shown in FIG. 2, the U bolts 22 extend only so far as the upper spacer plate 21, and the latter together with the mounting plates and the lower spacer plate are connected by means of conventional bolts 23.  In this
arrangement therefore, the clamping force required to clamp the spring is not sensed by any one of the sensing elements.  Nevertheless, the same arrangement of sensing element is used as in the example of FIG. 1 since it is obviously necessary to create
a clamping force using the bolts 23 to secure the spring to the axle.  The resistive elements of the sensing elements are connected in a bridge circuit in the same manner as with the example of FIG. 1.
Referring now to FIG. 5, the basic construction is identical to that of FIG. 1 with the exception that the sensing elements are now replaced by a pair of sensing rings 24, 25, these being disposed within annular recesses formed in the adjacent
faces of the upper spacing plate and upper mounting plate and the lower spacing plate and the lower mounting plate.  The sensing rings 24, 25 are provided with a plurality of resistive elements which are connected in a bridge circuit.
The arrangement shown in FIG. 6 eliminates the spacing plates and in this example, the sensing rings 24, 25 are disposed between the mounting plates and the axle.  Annular recesses are formed in the axis to partially locate the sensing rings.
The arrangement shown in FIG. 7 is a modification of the arrangement shown in FIG. 5 and employs the same technique as the example shown in FIG. 2.  That is to say that the clamping force required to clamp the spring is not applied through the
sensing rings.
The arrangement shown in FIG. 8 is similar to the arrangement shown in FIG. 6, but again in this example, the same technique as that used in the example of FIG. 2 is applied.
