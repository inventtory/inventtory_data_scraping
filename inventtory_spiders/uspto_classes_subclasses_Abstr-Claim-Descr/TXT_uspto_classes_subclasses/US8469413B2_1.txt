abstract: 
 An anchor plate assembly adjustably mounts a striker on the vehicle
     pillar. The striker has a striker base with apertures for receiving
     mounting bolts that will extend though oversized apertures in the pillar.
     An anchor base has a base plate for engagement with the pillar and bolt
     slots in the base plate for alignment with the oversized apertures in the
     pillar. An anchor slide has a slide plate mounted for vertical sliding
     movement on the base plate. The slide plate has nuts thereon aligned with
     the oversized apertures of the pillar. The nuts receive the mounting
     bolts so that when the mounting bolts are loose the striker together with
     the anchor slide can be adjusted vertically until tightening of the
     mounting bolts effectively clamps the slide plate of the anchor slide
     against the base plate of the anchor base to maintain the striker at the
     vertically adjusted position.
