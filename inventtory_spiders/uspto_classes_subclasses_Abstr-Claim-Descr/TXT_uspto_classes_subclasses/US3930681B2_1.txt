patent_description: 
This invention relates to automotive vehicle tilt cab latching devices.  It is desirable in automotive vehicles particularly commercial vehicles to provide as great a load carrying space on the
vehicle as possible without rendering servicing of the vehicle unduly difficult or expensive in time or rendering difficult the access to parts such as the engine or steering gear.  One way of achieving these ends is to provide the vehicle with a tilt
cab, that is, one which can be raised about a hinge axis at the front of the vehicle to permit easy access to the engine and other mechanism normally shrouded by the cab when it is in the down position on the vehicle frame, as it would be for normal use. With such a tilt cab arrangement it is essential to provide a latching device to ensure that the cab will not unlatch and tilt forward.
In an automotive vehicle cab latching device according to the invention a portion of a member of the tilt cab is adapted to be engaged with a portion of a frame member of the vehicle and clamped thereto by means of an over-centre or toggle clamp
comprising a pivot bar pivotally mounted in a latch housing secured on one of said members and pivotally movable therein by means of a lever fixed on one end of said bar, and an over-centre link fixed at one end on said bar and connected at its other end
by a link pin to one end of a hook of greater length than said over-centre link, said housing and a portion of said hook intermediate the ends of the hook being interconnected by a guide-pin and slot connection arranged so that angular movement of said
lever into a first predetermined position effects movement of the link and hook into a position in which the link is at an angle to a line joining said pivot bar and the point of engagement of said members, and a line joining the ends of the hook is at
an angle to said link, and movement of said lever from said first position towards a second position pivots said over-centre link and link pin from their first said positions into a slightly over-centre position relative to a line joining said pivot bar
axis and said point of engagement of said members and moves said hook angularly about said link pin relative to said over-centre link so that the free end of the hook is brought from a position disengaged from the other of said members into a position in
which it engages said other member and clamps it against the first member.
Preferably two such devices are provided, one on each side of the vehicle and a linkage interconnects the two devices so that operation of one device also operates the other.
The slot of the pin and slot connection may be curved along its length and the curvature at one end portion of the slot may be such that relative movement between said one end portion and said guide-pin results in a greater angular movement of
the hook than results from the relative movement of the remainder of the slot and the guide-pin.
The length of the guide-pin may be such as to permit of its flexing as the hook is moved to and from its first and second positions and by such flexing the guide-pin can accommodate the lengthwise displacement of the hook as it pivots about the
link pin and said other member. The appended claims define the scope of the monopoly claimed.  How the invention can be performed is hereinafter particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a device according to the invention;
FIG. 2 is a side view, to a smaller scale, showing the device of FIG. 1 assembled and indicating the disengaged position of its hook;
FIG. 3 is a view, similar to FIG. 2, with the hook in its engaged position; and
FIG. 4 is a view from the rear of the vehicle and looking forward to the front of the vehicle and showing two devices according to the invention located at the rear of the cab and connected to one another by a linkage. FIGS. 1 to 3 show
an automotive tilt cab latching device 1 according to the invention; the vehicle however is not shown in these Figures.  The device shown in these Figures has a cab member 2 adapted to be engaged with a frame member 4 of the vehicle and clamped thereto
by a toggle clamp 6.  The cab member comprises a channel-shaped plate 8 securable at its open edges to a resilient mounting 10 on the vehicle cab (not shown).  The channel plate 8 has an aperture 12 in one side through which can pass a hook 40 of the
device, as will be later described, and the closed base portion 14 of the channel plate is engageable in a complementary trough shaped portion 18 of a latch housing 16 fixed on, and constituting a portion of, the frame member 4 of the vehicle.  The latch
housing 16 conveniently is formed as a casting the general shape of which is that of a box in which said trough shaped portion is the upper wall, and in which one side wall adjacent the two end walls 20, 22 connected to said trough shaped portion is
omitted.  The base 24 of the housing is adapted to be secured on the frame member 4 of the vehicle in a position such that when the vehicle cab is in the down position bearing on the frame member, the closed base portion 14 of the cab member is received
in the trough portion 18 of the latch housing 16.  The cab member 2 is clamped to the frame member 4 by means of a toggle clamp 6 comprising a pivot bar 26 pivotally mounted in the side walls 20, 22 of the latch housing and pivotable by means of a lever
28 fixed on one end of the bar, and an over-centre link 30 fixed at one end 32 on said bar and connected at its other end 34 by a link pin 36 to one end 38 of a hook 40 of greater length than said over-centre link 30.  The hook 40 has a curved slot 42
intermediate its ends 38, 44 and a guide-pin 46 journalled in the side walls 20, 22 of the housing outboard of the pivot bar 26 extends through the slot 42 in the hook 40.  A domed adjuster bolt 48 is located in the other or free end 44 of the hook 40
and forms a curved end portion or the head of the hook.
The operation of the device 1 is as follows, it being assumed that the cab is in the down position resting on the vehicle frame 4 and the cab member 2 is engaged in the trough-like wall portion 18 of the latch housing 16.  The hook 40 at this
point is seen to be swung away from the cab member 2 (as shown in FIG. 2).  In this first predetermined position the link 30 and the hook 40 are in a position in which the link is at an angle to a line joining the pivot bar 26 and the point of engagement
of the members 2, 4 (for convenience this may be considered to be on the centre line of the base of the trough-like wall of the latch housing) and a line joining the ends 38, 44 of the hook 40 is at an angle to said link 30.  Movement of the lever 28
(clockwise as viewed in the drawing) from the first position towards a second position (shown in FIG. 3) pivots the over-centre link 30 and link pin 36 clockwise from their first said positions into a slightly over-centre position relative to a line
joining said pivot bar axis and said point of engagement of said members 2, 4 and the engagement of the slot 42 in the hook 40 with the guide-pin 46 moves said hook 40 anti-clockwise about said link pin 36 relative to said over-centre link 30 so that the
free end 44 of the hook is brought from its first position, disengaged from the cab member 2, into a second position in which it is engaged with the cab member 2 and clamps it against the latch housing 4, thereby securing the cab to the vehicle frame.
The slot 42 has a sharper curvature at its end portion 50 adjacent the link pin 36 than over the rest of its length so that movement of that end portion 50 about the guide-pin 46 results in a greater angular movement of the hook 40 for movement
of that length of the slot relative to the guide-pin than results from movement of the remainder of the slot relative to the pin.  The effect of this is to move the hook 40 rapidly into or out of engagement with the cab member 2 depending upon whether
the hook is being engaged or disengaged from the cab member.
The length of the guide-pin 46 (FIG. 1) is such that the pin can flex to accommodate the slight lengthwise movement of the hook 40 as it pivots about its over-centre position when being engaged or disengaged from the cab member 2.  In the
slightly over-centre position, the hook 40 is in tension between the point of engagement of its curved head 48 with the cab member 2 and the link pin 36, and the over-centre link 30 is in compression between the link pin 36 and the pivot bar 26.  Further
movement of the toggle clamp 6 is prevented by the guide-pin 46 abutting the end 52 of the slot 42.  Because of this over-centre position of the toggle clamp 6 any attempt to move the cab member 2 away from the frame member 4 without moving the toggle
clamp 6 out of its slightly over-centre position serves only to latch the two members 2, 4 more securely together.
The domed head bolt 48 at the contoured free end 44 of the hook can be adjusted to take up manufacturing tolerances and wear to ensure that there is no play between the hook and the cab member when the hook is in the engaged position. 
Additionally, as the hook is moved into or out of engagement with the cab member the domed head bolt rolls into or out of engagement with the cab member, thus minimizing wear of the contacting parts.  The guide slot 42 may be widened at its other end 52
remote from the over-centre link 30, to permit a slight change in the angular movement of the hook 40 so that the bolt 48 can pivot and ensure that its domed head rolls over the cab member 2 without straining the slot 42 against the pivot bar 26.
As shown in FIG. 4, two devices 1, 11 according to the invention are mounted on the vehicle, and in the Figure, a portion of the cab 56 is shown latched to the frame members 4.  These two devices are interconnected by a rigid link 54 so that
operation of one device also operates the other.  The guide-pin 46 and slot 42 connection ensures that in each device 1, 11 the hook 40 moves in a predetermined path thus ensuring that the two devices can be operated in unison.
The positions of the first or cab member 2 and the latch housing 16 could be reversed so that the first member 2 was secured to the frame 4 and the latch housing to the cab 56.
If desired, a stop member could be provided on the pivot bar 26 for movement into or out of engagement with a stop surface on the device 6 to ensure that with the pin slot connection only the design angular movement of the hook 40 will occur.
An automotive vehicle tilt cab latching device as described above provides a convenient and effective way of securing a vehicle tilt cab to the vehicle frame when the cab is in the down position and which restrains the cab from tilting during
normal use of the vehicle.
Additionally, when two devices are used they can be interconnected for operation from one side of the vehicle, which is a great convenience to the operator.
