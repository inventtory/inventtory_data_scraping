DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
 Selected embodiments will now be explained with reference to the drawings.  It will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the following descriptions of the embodiments are provided for illustration only and not for
the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
 Referring initially to FIGS. 1 and 2, a vehicle 10 is illustrated in accordance with a first embodiment.  The vehicle 10 includes a vehicle body structure 12 that defines a pair of roof ditches 14 that are covered and concealed by corresponding
molding assemblies 16.  The molding assemblies 16 are described in greater detail below after a description of selected portions of the vehicle body structure 12 and the roof ditches 14.
 As shown in FIGS. 1-3 and 6-10, the vehicle body structure 12 includes, among other things, a roof panel 20, a pair of side panels 22, a pair of hinges 24, a vehicle door 26 and the molding assemblies 16.  The roof panel 20 and the side panels
22 are typically formed of one or more pieces of sheet metal or any other suitable material that is welded or rigidly and fixedly attached together to form a substantially rigid portion of the vehicle body structure 12.  Also the roof panel 20 and/or the
side panels 22 can be supported by other structural members as needed and/or desired.
 The roof panel 20 and the side panels 22 are dimensioned, contoured and shaped to define the pair of roof ditches 14 that are spaced apart along the roof panel 20 in a direction that is perpendicular or substantially perpendicular to a
longitudinal direction or lengthwise direction of the roof ditches 14.  As indicated, the side panels 22 are fixed to the roof panel 20 such that the side panels 22 and the roof panel 20 collectively define the overall shape of the roof ditches 14.  Each
roof ditch 20 is thus a joint that is made by union of the roof panel 20 and a respective one of the side panels 22 of the vehicle 10.  The roof ditches 14 are contoured and shaped to compliment the overall shape and design of the vehicle 10.  The
depicted contour and overall shape of the roof ditches 14 can vary from vehicle to vehicle.  Further the roof ditches 14 are depicted as extending between front and rear ends of the roof panel 20 and side panels 22.  Other orientations and directional
orientation are possible and are within the scope of the invention.
 The roof ditches 14, the hinges 24 and the molding assemblies 16 are identical to one another except that they are symmetrically shaped mirror images of one another.  Consequently, description of one roof ditch 14, one hinge 24 and one molding
assembly 16 applies to both.  Therefore, for the sake of brevity, only one of the roof ditches 14, only one of the hinges 24 and only one of the molding assemblies 16, are described below.
 As indicated in FIG. 5, the roof ditch 14 and the molding assembly 16 both include a compound arcuate and curved shape.  Specifically, as indicated in the side view in FIG. 3, the molding assembly 16 and the roof ditch 14 beneath the molding
assembly 16, have an arcuate shape when viewed from the side.  When viewed from above, as in FIGS. 1 and 5, the roof ditch 14 has a curved shape.  The overall curved and contoured shape of the molding assembly 16 is demonstrated in FIG. 4 and corresponds
to the shape of the roof ditch 14.  Specifically, FIG. 4 shows the molding assembly 16 removed from the roof ditch 14, but is shown with an overall shape that corresponds to the overall shape of the roof ditch 14.
 Also, as shown in FIGS. 5, 8, 9 and 10, the roof ditch 14 includes an inner wall surface 30 that is within a lateral boundary of the roof panel 20, an outer wall surface 32 that is positioned adjacent to the lateral boundary of the roof panel 20
and a recessed support surface 34 that extends laterally between the bottom edges of the inner and outer wall surfaces 30 and 32.  The inner wall surface 30 extends longitudinally along a first side of the recessed support surface 34 and the outer wall
surface 32 extends longitudinally along a second side of the recessed support surface 34.  The outer wall surface 32 is disposed outboard of the inner wall surface 30.  The inner wall surface 30 terminates at a top edge 30a that is defined along the
intersection of the inner wall surface 30 and the roof panel 20.  Similarly, the outer wall surface 32 terminates at top edge 32a that is defined along the intersection of the outer wall surface 32 and the adjacent one of the side panels 22.  The inner
wall surface 30, the outer wall surface 32 and the recessed support surface 34 therefore extend from the front section of the roof of the vehicle body structure 12 to the rear section of the roof of the vehicle body structure 12.
 As shown in FIG. 5, a rearward section 34a of the recessed support surface 34 has a depth that is greater than the remainder of the recessed support surface 34 to accommodate the hinge 24.  As is shown in FIG. 5, the roof ditch 14 includes a
plurality of fastening members 36.  Specifically, each of the fastening members 36 includes a head portion and a shaft portion.  As indicated in FIGS. 33 and 35, the shaft portion of each fastening members 36 is rigidly fixed to and extends through the
recessed support surface 34 of the roof ditch 14.  The head portion of each of the fastening members 36 extends above the recessed support surface 34.  However the head portion of each of the fastening members 36 is located below the top edges 30a and
32a of the inner and outer wall surfaces 30 and 32.  The head portion of the fastening members 36 is dimensioned and shaped to provide an attachment point for the molding assembly 16, as is described in greater detail below.
 A brief description of the hinges 24 is now provided with specific reference to FIGS. 6-10.  The hinge 24 at least partially extends into the roof ditch 14.  Further, the hinge 24 is mounted in the roof ditch 14 of the roof panel 20 and is at
least partially covered by sections of the molding assembly 30, as discussed in more detail below.  Basically, the hinge 24 includes a base component 38 and an arm component 40.  As shown in FIGS. 7, 9 and 10, the base component 38 of the hinge 24 is
rigidly fixed to the rearward section 34a of the recessed support surface 34 of the roof ditch 14 by fasteners.  As shown in FIG. 6, a rearward end of the base portion 38 is exposed at the pivot axis P. The arm component 40 pivots about the pivot axis P
such that the majority of the arm component 40 of the hinge 24 is located outside of the roof ditch 14, as shown in FIG. 7.  The arm component 40 is rigidly fixed to an upper end of the vehicle door 26 by fasteners (not shown).
 The pivot axes P of the hinges 24 are generally perpendicularly arranged with respect to a longitudinal direction of the vehicle body structure 12.  In other words, the vehicle door 26 is configured as a lift gate with the hinges 24 having the
horizontally arranged pivot axes P between the base component 38 and the arm component 40.
 Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the vehicle door 26 is configured as a rear door (i.e., a lift gate) of the vehicle 10.  In other words, the vehicle door 26 is configured as a lift gate with the hinges 24 having horizontally arranged pivot
axes P between the roof panel 20 and the vehicle door 26.  Typically, the pivot axes P extend in directions that are perpendicular or at least transverse to the longitudinal direction of the vehicle 10.  As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the hinges 24 are
situated at an upper-rear portion of the vehicle door 26 of the vehicle body structure 12.
 The vehicle door 26 that is typically formed of metal or any other suitable material and is pivotally mounted to the vehicle body structure 12 by the pair of hinges 24.  The hinges 24 are typically made of metal or any other suitable rigid
material having sufficient strength and durability to support the vehicle door 26 in the open position.  A more detailed description of the hinge 24 and vehicle door 26 can be found in U.S.  application Ser.  No. 13/042,990, filed Mar.  8, 2012 (Ref. No.
NT-US115071).  The disclosure of U.S.  application Ser.  No. 13/042,990 is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
 A description of the molding assembly 16 is now provided with initial reference to FIGS. 3, 4 and 5.  The molding assembly 16 can be made of plastic or any other suitable material that can have some flexibility.  In the depicted embodiment, the
molding assembly 16 is contoured and shaped to extend partially into and covers the roof ditch 14.
 As indicated in FIG. 3, the molding assembly 16 includes a front section 44, a mid-section 46 and a rear section 48.  The front section 44 and the rear section 48 cover the roof ditch 14 and further are contoured to extend flush with the roof
panel 20 (a vehicle body panel) between respective the top edges 30a and 32a of the first and second wall surfaces 30 and 32.  The mid-section 46 extends between the front and rear sections 44 and 48.  The mid-section 46 has a convex contour as viewed in
cross-section in FIGS. 30-35 and extends above the roof panel 20 (the vehicle body panel) between respective top edges 30a and 32a of the first and second wall surfaces 30 and 32 forming a roof rail protruding upward from and above the roof panel 20. 
Thus, the mid-section 46 has the appearance of a side roof rail, but does not include slots or gaps typically associated with roof rails or roof rack assemblies.
 As shown in FIG. 5, the molding assembly 16 includes a plurality of components.  Specifically, the molding assembly 16 basically includes a cover 50, an elongated molding member or molding member 52, a pair of elongated sealing members 54, a
plurality of cushions 56 and a pair of caps 58 that conceal a pair of cleats 60.
 A description of the cover 50 is now provided with specific reference to FIGS. 6, 7 and 10-15.  The cover 50 can be made of, for example, a plastic material, a polymer material, a metallic material or other materials suitable for use in an
exterior automotive application.  The cover 50 basically includes a top portion 64 and a close-out portion 66.  The top portion 64 is dimensioned and shaped to span a width of the roof ditch 14 between respective top edges 30a and 32a of the first and
second wall surfaces 30 and 32.  The top section 64 includes an upper surface 64a, a first lateral side 64b and a second lateral side 64c.
 The close-out portion 66 is angularly offset from the top portion 64, extending downward relative to the top portion 64 when installed to the vehicle 10 and the roof ditch 14.  Specifically, the close-out portion 66 extends from a peripheral end
edge of the top portion 64 towards the recessed support surface 34 of the roof ditch 14, as indicated in FIGS. 6 and 7.  The close-out portion 66 also defines a slot 66a through which the arm component 40 of the hinge 24 extends.  The close-out portion
66 extends laterally along a rear open section of the roof ditch 14 from the inner wall surface 30 to the outer wall surface 32, but within the roof ditch 14.
 As indicated in FIGS. 11 and 15, the cover 50 also includes a cover attachment section 68 and a molding attachment section 70.  The cover attachment section 68 is provided to couple the cover 50 at a fixed position relative to the vehicle body
structure 12.  Specifically, the cover attachment section 68 is configured to fix the cover 50 to the hinge 24, with the hinge 24 being fixedly secured to the roof ditch 14 by fasteners, as indicated in FIGS. 8, 9 and 10.
 The cover attachment section 68 is defined by a box-like structure that extends from an underside of the top portion 64 along a concealed side of the close-out portion 66, as shown in FIG. 15.  The cover attachment section 68 defines a fastener
slot 68a.  As shown in FIG. 17, a snap-fitting fastener 72 is installed in the fastener slot 68a.  As shown in FIG. 7, the snap-fitting fastener 72 is inserted thru an aperture 38a in the base component 38 of the hinge 24, thereby fixing the cover 50 in
position relative to the hinge 24 and the roof ditch 14.
 The molding attachment section 70 is defined along the top portion 64 of the cover 50, as shown in FIGS. 11-15.  More specifically, the molding attachment section 70 includes first and second slots 74 and 76 which, along with snap fitting
projections 78 and 80 of the molding member 52 (shown in FIGS. 16-18), define a lengthwise movement connection between the cover 50 and the molding member 52.  The first slot 74 and the second slot 76 are defined by the top portion 64 of the cover 50. 
The first and second slots 74 and 76 are both laterally and longitudinally offset with respect to the lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14.
 The first slot 74 and the second slot 76 both extend in the lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14.  As is further explained below, the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 are attachment members of the molding member 52 and are movably
installed, respectively, in the first and second slots 74 and 76.  As a result of the lengthwise movement connection between the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 of the molding member 52 and the first slot 74 and the second slot 76 of the cover 50, the
rear section 48 of the molding member 52 is movable relative to the cover 50 in the lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14.  The snap fitting projection 78 snap-fits into the first slot 74 of the cover 50 such that the molding member 50 cannot move in
lateral directions relative to the cover 50.  However, the snap fitting projection 78 can slide in a lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14 along the first slot 74.  Similarly, the snap fitting projection 80 snap-fits into the second slot 76 of the
cover 50 such that the molding member 50 cannot move in lateral directions relative to the cover 50.  However, the snap fitting projection 80 can slide in a lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14 along the second slot 76.
 The possible movement of the molding member 52 in the lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14 is provided because the molding assembly 16 is made of a completely different material than the roof panel 20 and the side panel 22.  Specifically,
the vehicle body structure 12 is preferably made of metal.  The molding assembly 16 can be made of plastic, polymers, rubber material or the like.  Consequently, the molding member 52 can undergo expansion and contraction in response to changes in
temperature that differs from the thermal expansion and contraction rates of the vehicle body structure 12.  Specifically, the overall length of the molding member 52 can increase and decrease as a result of thermal expansion and contraction relative to
the vehicle 10.  The first and second slots 74 and 76 are elongated such that the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 can undergo limited sliding movement along the length of the first and second slots 74 and 76 to accommodate the changes in overall
length of the molding member 52 as it undergoes thermal expansion and contraction.
 As is indicated in FIGS. 6 and 7, the cover 50 and the roof ditch 14 define a cavity.  The base component 38 of the hinge 24 is situated within this cavity and the arm component 40 (a vehicle door mounting structure) of the hinge 24 is situated
outside of the cavity.  More specifically, a rear end of the base component 38 of the hinge 24 is located adjacent to the slot 66a of the close-out portion 66 of the cover 50.  The arm component 40 of the hinge 24 extends through the slot 66a of the
close-out portion 66 of the cover 50.  Consequently, the majority of the arm component 40 of the hinge 24 is substantially located outside of the cavity defined by the cover 50 and the roof ditch 14.
 The cover 50 also includes a hook 82 that extends downward from the top portion 64 of the cover 50.  The hook 82 is configured to hook on to a forward edge of the base component 38 of the hinge 24 to further secure the cover 50 in place relative
to the roof ditch 14.
 A description of the molding member 52 is now provided with specific reference to FIGS. 21-35.  The molding member 52 is an elongated member that is formed unitarily as a single monolithic element.  The molding member 52 can be molded in a
single step, or can be molded in a series of steps to form the single monolithic element.  The molding member 52 can be made of a plastic material, a polymer material, a rubber or rubber-like material or any other material suitable for use as a molding
in an automotive application where such molding is exposed to the elements (sunshine, wind, cold, heat, rain, etc. .  . . ).
 The molding member 52 includes three basic sections, a front section 84, a mid-section 86 and a rear section 88.  The front section 84 corresponds to the front section 44 of the molding assembly 16, the mid-section 86 corresponds to the
mid-section 46 of the molding assembly and the rear section 88 corresponds to the rear section 48 of the molding assembly 16.  Specifically, the front section 84 and the rear section 88 cover the roof ditch 14 and further are contoured to extend flush
with the roof panel 20 between respective the top edges 30a and 32a of the first and second wall surfaces 30 and 32.  The mid-section 86 extends between the front and rear sections 84 and 88.  The mid-section 86 has a convex contour (as viewed in
cross-section in FIGS. 30-3) and extends above the roof panel 20 between respective top edges 30a and 32a of the first and second wall surfaces 30 and 32 forming a roof rail protruding upward from and above the roof panel 20.  Thus, the mid-section 86
has the appearance of a side roof rail, but does not include slots or gaps typically associated with roof rails or roof rack assemblies.  The front section 84, the mid-section 86 and the rear section 88 extend in a lengthwise direction relative to the
roof ditch 14.
 When viewed in cross-section as in FIGS. 30-35, the molding member 52 includes a top portion 90, a first lateral side 92, a second lateral side 94, a plurality of attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 and the above
described snap fitting projections 78 and 80.
 The top portion 90 has a contoured shape that has differing profiles along the lengthwise direction.  For example, as indicated in FIGS. 1-3, 5, 8 and 10 in the front section 84 and rear section 88 of the molding member 52, the top portion 90
appears to be flat, but can be contoured to include a slight curvature and arcuate profile corresponding to the curvature and arcuate contour of the roof panel 20 and adjacent side panel 22.  In the mid-section 86 of the molding member 52, the top
portion 90 is raised, such that the top portion 90 protrudes above the roof panel 20 and adjacent side panel 22.  Further, within the mid-section 86 of the molding member 52, the overall shape and cross-sectional profile of the top portion 90 changes
along the lengthwise direction, as indicated in the drawings.  The top portion 90 can be shaped and contoured in any of a variety of shapes depending upon the overall design of the vehicle body structure 12 of the vehicle 10.  The shape of the top
portion 90 in the depicted embodiment is for example only, and is not intended to limit the overall shape and appearance of the top portion 90.
 As shown in FIGS. 4, 5 and 21, the top portion 90 includes a pair of openings 112a and 112b.  The openings 112a and 112b are covered by the caps 58.  The caps 58 are removable to expose the cleats 60.  The cleats 60 are fixed to the recessed
support surface 34 by fasteners (not shown).  The cleats 60 are configured to support cross-members (not shown) that form part of an optional feature of a roof rack system.  These cross-members extend across the roof panel 20 between the two roof ditches
14 and are attached to the cleats 60 in a conventional manner.  It should be understood from the drawings and description herein that the openings 112a and 112b, the cleats 60 and the caps 58 are optional features that can be omitted.  Since these
features are optional, further description is omitted for the sake of brevity.
 The first lateral side 92 and second lateral side 94 extend downward from opposite lateral sides of the top portion 90 of the molding member 52.  The first lateral side 92 is positioned adjacent to the roof panel 20 and the second lateral side
94 is positioned adjacent to the side panel 22 with the molding member 52 installed to the roof ditch 14.  The first and second lateral sides 92 and 94 further include respective recesses or lips 92a and 94a that extend in a lengthwise direction along
the entire length of the molding member 52.  With the molding member 52 installed to the roof ditch 14, the lip 92a is positioned adjacent to the top edge 30a of the inner wall surface 30, and the lip 94a is positioned adjacent to the top edge 32a of the
outer wall surface 32, as indicated in FIGS. 31 and 33.  The first lateral side 92 includes a bottom edge 92b that is located below the lip 92a, as shown in FIG. 32.  As well, the second lateral side 94 includes a bottom edge 94b that is located below
the lip 92a, as shown in FIG. 32.
 The first lateral side 92 and second lateral side 94 also include a plurality of downwardly extending projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b, as shown in FIGS. 22-27.  The first lateral side 92 includes the
projections 120a, 122a, 124a, 126a and 128a, and the second lateral side 94 is provided with the projections 120b, 122b, 124b, 126b and 128b.  As indicated in FIGS. 21-25, the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b are
staggered along the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, but are paired together.  Specifically, the projections 120a and 120b are approximately aligned with one another relative to the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, as shown in
FIGS. 21, 22 and 23.  The projections 122a and 122b are approximately aligned with one another relative to the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 23.  The projections 124a and 124b are approximately aligned with one
another relative to the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 24.  The projections 126a and 126b are approximately aligned with one another relative to the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, as shown in FIGS.
21 and 25.  Further, the projections 128a and 128b are approximately aligned with one another relative to the lengthwise direction of the molding member 52, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 25.
 The elongated sealing members 54 are installed along respective ones of the lips 92a and 94a, as indicated in FIGS. 8, 33 and 35.  The elongated sealing members 54 provide a cushion between the roof ditch 14 and the molding member 52.  The
elongated sealing members 54 extend the length of the molding member 52.  The elongated sealing members 54 include slots that receive the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b.  More specifically, the projections 120a,
120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b extend downward through the slots formed in the sealing members 54.
 The projections 120a through 128b are stabilizing projections that position the molding member 52 in a relatively fixed orientation within the roof ditch 14.  The projections 120a, 122a, 124a, 126a and 128a extend below the lip 92a and the
bottom edge 92b of the first lateral side 92.  Similarly, the projections 120b, 122b, 124b, 126b and 128b extend below the lip 94a and the bottom edge 94b of the second lateral side 94.  The projections 120a through 128b are further tapered in thickness,
as indicated in FIGS. 30 and 31.  More specifically, the projections 120a through 128b have tapering thicknesses such that upper ends of the stabilizing projections 120a through 128b are thicker than lower end of the stabilizing projections, as shown in
FIGS. 30 and 31.  Further, with the molding member 52 installed in the roof ditch 14, the projections 120a, 122a, 124a, 126a and 128a of the first lateral side 92 conform to shape of the inner side wall 30.
 Similarly, the projections 120b, 122b, 124b, 126b and 128b of the second lateral side 94 conform to the shape of the outer side wall 32 with the molding member 52 installed to the roof ditch 14.  In other words, the projections 120a, 122a, 124a,
126a and 128a of the first lateral side 30 extend downward away from the top portion 90 along the first wall surface 30 of the roof ditch 14 and the projections 120b, 122b, 124b, 126b and 128b of the second lateral side 94 extend downward away from the
top portion 90 along the second wall surface 32 of the roof ditch 14.  Further, the projections 120a through 128b all extend downward below respective bottom edges 92b and 94b of the first and second lateral sides 92 and 94 into contact with the recessed
support surface 34 of the roof ditch 14.
 Further, each of the projections 120a through 128b is provided a corresponding one of the cushions 56.  The cushions 56 are included to reduce and/or prevent noise that might otherwise occur during movement of the molding member 52 relative to
the roof ditch 14.  More specifically, as the molding member 52 experiences thermal expansion and contraction, the cushions 56 provide a reduced friction surface that permits small amounts of movement of the molding member 52 relative to the surfaces of
the roof ditch 14.
 A description is now provided of the plurality of attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110.  The attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 all have structural features in common with one another but due
to variations in the overall shape of the molding member 52 along its length, each of the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 can have slightly different overall dimensions.  However, the general description below of the
attachment structure 102 applies to each of the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110.
 As indicated in FIGS. 29, 32 and 33, each of the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 includes a first side wall 132, a second side wall 134, a lateral wall 136 extending between the first and second side walls 132 and
134 and a bottom wall 138.  An upper end of the first side wall 132 is fixed to and formed integrally (molded) with the first lateral side 92 of the molding member 52.  Further, an tipper end of the second side wall 134 is fixed to and formed integrally
(molded) with the second lateral side 94 of the molding member 52.  The first side wall 132 extends downward from an upper area of the first lateral side 92 and the second side wall 134 extends downward from a mid-section of the second lateral side 94. 
Further, the side wall 136 extends between the first and second side walls 132 and 134, being integrally formed or molded therewith.  However, as the first side wall 132 extends downward, a lower section of the first side wall 132 is spaced apart from
the first lateral side 92 and the second lateral side 94.  As well, as the second side wall 134 extends downward, the lower section of the second side wall 134 is spaced apart from the second lateral side 94.
 The first side wall 132 and the lateral wall 136 are perpendicularly arranged relative to one another.  The lateral wall 136 and the second side wall 134 are also arranged perpendicularly relative to one another, with the first and second side
walls 132 and 134 facing one another.  The first side wall 132, the second side wall 134 and the lateral wall 136 define an open area between the first and second side walls 132 and 134 and above the bottom wall 138.
 The bottom wall 138 extends in a direction that is approximately perpendicular to each of the first, second and third side walls 132, 134 and 136.  Further, the bottom wall is formed integrally (molded) with the first and second side walls 132,
134 and the lateral wall 136.  The bottom wall 138 includes a slot or opening 140.  The bottom wall 138 defines a lower or bottom surface that includes a pair of ribs 142.  The ribs 142 extend in a lengthwise direction relative to the roof ditch 14.  The
ribs 142 are located on opposite lateral sides of the opening 140.  The lower surface of the bottom wall 138 of each of the attachment structures are positioned vertically lower than adjacent sections of the longitudinally extending lips 92a and 94a.
 A clip 144 (clip member) is snap fitted into the opening 140, as shown in FIGS. 33 and 35, for each of the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110, but not the attachment structure 96, as is explained below.  The clip 144
defines an elongated slot that snap fits to a corresponding one of the fastening members 36.  Hence, there is a plurality of the clips 144, one for each of the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110.  The clips 144 all include mounting
parts that snap fit to the bottom wall 138 at the opening 140.
 It should be understood from the drawings and description herein, that the fastening members 36 shown in FIG. 5, are spaced apart from one another in alignment with the spacing between the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and
110.  With the clips 144 installed to the openings 140 of each of the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110, the molding member 52 is installed to the roof ditch 14 by pressing down on the molding member 52, snap fitting each of the
fastening members 36, one by one, into the clips 144 of each of the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110.  The elongated slot of each of the clips 144 receives one the fastening members 36 extending therethrough.  The elongated slots
of the clips 144 extend in a direction approximately parallel to a lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14 and are dimensioned relative to the fastening members 36 such that the molding member can undergo limited movement relative to the roof ditch. 
Consequently, it is possible for there to be small amounts of relative movement between the fastening members 36 and the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 in the lengthwise direction of the roof ditch 14.  More specifically, the
clips 144 are configured to allow for thermal expansion and contraction of the molding member relative to the roof ditch 14.
 As is indicated in FIG. 21, the attachment structure 96 is provided with a clip 146 that has a rounded opening.  Consequently, once the molding member 52 is installed to the roof ditch 14, the front section 84 is fixed in position relative to
the roof ditch 14 via the connection between the fastening member 36 and the clip 146 in the attachment structure 96.
 As is indicated in FIGS. 21-27, the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b (the stabilizing projections) of the first and second lateral sides 92 and 94 are offset from the attachment structures 96, 98, 100,
102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 (roof attachment portions) as viewed laterally with respect to a lengthwise direction along the roof ditch 14.  More specifically, the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b (the stabilizing
projections) are longitudinally spaced apart from adjacent ones of the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 (roof attachment portions).  For example, as shown in FIG. 23, the projections 120a and 120b are spaced apart from the
attachment structure 98.  Specifically, the projections 120a and 120b are positioned closer to the front of the vehicle 10 than the attachment structure 98.  The projections 122a and 122b are also spaced apart from and are located rearward from the
attachment structure 98.  Further as shown in FIG. 24, the projections 124a and 124b are located between the attachment structures 102 and 104, being offset therefrom.  As shown in FIG. 25, the projections 126a and 126b are located between the attachment
structures 106 and 108, being offset therefrom.
 As is indicated in FIGS. 27, 30 and 31, the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b (the stabilizing projections) extend downward from the first and second lateral sides 92 and 94 lower than a lowermost surface
of the bottom wall 138 of each of the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 (the roof attachment portions).  Further, the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a, 126b, 128a and 128b extend downward from the first and
second lateral sides 92 and 94 lower than the ribs 142, as indicated in FIGS. 30 and 31.
 However, when the molding member 52 is installed within the roof ditch 14, the ribs 142 can contact and remain in contact with the recessed support surface 34 with the molding member 52 installed to the roof ditch 14.  Alternatively, the ribs
142 can be dimensioned to remain slightly spaced apart from the recessed support surface 34 with the molding member 52 installed to the roof ditch 14.
 In the depicted embodiment, the molding member 52 (the top portion, the first lateral side 92 and the second lateral side 94), the snap fitting projections 78 and 80, and the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 are
formed unitarily as a single monolithic element.
 During assembly, the cover 50 is first attached to the hinge 24.  The clips 144 and the clip 146 are installed to the attachment structures 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110, and the attachment structure 96, respectively.  The seals 54 are
installed to the lips 92a and 94a of the molding member 52.  Thereafter, the molding member 52 is installed to the roof ditch 14 such that the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 are inserted into the first and second slots 74 and 76 of the cover 50; and
the fastening members 36 are snap fitted into the slots or openings of the clips 144 (and 146) installed to the attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 of the molding member 52.  During installation, the projections 120a, 122a,
124a, 126a and 128a of the first lateral side 92 of the molding member 52 press against and conform to the shape of the inner wall surface 30 of the roof ditch 14, then contact the recessed support surface 34 of the roof ditch 14.  Similarly, the
projections 120b, 122b, 124b, 126b, and 128b of the second lateral side 94 of the molding member 52 press against and conform to the shape of the outer wall surface 32 of the roof ditch 14, then contact the recessed support surface 34 of the roof ditch
14.
 The attachment structures 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108 and 110 snap fitted to the fastening members 36 fixes the molding assembly 16 to the roof ditch 14.  Further, contact between the projections 120a, 120b, 122a, 122b, 124a, 124b, 126a,
126b, 128a and 128b of the molding member 52 and the inner wall surface 30, the outer wall surface 32 and the recessed support surface 34 ensure a firm, non-twistable and non-rotatable installation of the molding member 52 to the roof ditch 14.
Second Embodiment
 Referring now to FIGS. 36 and 37, a molding assembly in accordance with a second embodiment will now be explained.  In view of the similarity between the first and second embodiments, the parts of the second embodiment that are identical to the
parts of the first embodiment will be given the same reference numerals as the parts of the first embodiment.  Moreover, the descriptions of the parts of the second embodiment that are identical to the parts of the first embodiment may be omitted for the
sake of brevity.  The parts of the second embodiment that differ from the parts of the first embodiment will be indicated with a single prime (').
 In the second embodiment, the molding assembly is very similar to the first embodiment in that it includes the cover 50, but includes a modified molding member 52'.  In the second embodiment the molding member 52 of the first embodiment has been
replaced with the molding member 52'.  The molding member 52' includes each and every feature of the molding member 52 of the first embodiment, as described above.  However, in the second embodiment, the molding member 52' includes an additional feature. Specifically, the molding member 52' includes an attachment projection 200 that extends laterally inwardly from adjacent the bottom edge 94b of the second lateral side 94 of the molding member 52'.  Further, the attachment projection 200 has an upper
surface (not visible) that extends approximately parallel to an underside surface 88a of the molding member 52'.  The attachment projection 200 is a snap fitting projection in the second embodiment, as described further below.
 As described in the first embodiment (and included in the second embodiment), the molding member 52' also includes the snap fitting projections 78 and 80.  The snap fitting projections 78 and 80 extend away from the underside surface 88a of the
molding member 52.  The snap-fitting projection 200 extends in a direction that is perpendicular to the snap fitting projections 78 and 80.  The attachment projection 200 further extends in a direction that is perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of
the molding member 52'.  The attachment projection 200 is spaced apart from the underside surface 88a of the molding member 52' by a distance that allows the second lateral side 64c to be disposed between the underside surface 88a of the molding member
52 and the attachment projection 200.  Preferably, the attachment projection 200 is positioned to retain the upper surface 64a of the top portion 64 of the cover 50 flush to the underside surface 88a of the molding member 52'.
 As is shown in FIG. 37, the attachment projection 200 (the attachment projection) extends under the second lateral side 64c of the cover 50 in the installed position (FIG. 37 is an upside-down view of the cover 50 and the molding member 52'). 
However, it should be understood that the attachment projection 200 can be located on either lateral side of the molding member 52' such that either one of the first lateral side 64b and the second lateral side 64c of the cover 50 can be retained by the
snap fitting projection 200.  Further, multiple ones of the snap fitting projections 200 can be included on the molding member 52'.  It should be understood from the drawings and the description herein that the lengthwise movement connection defined by
the connection between the first and second slots 74 and 76, and the snap fitting projections 78 and 80, is enhanced and supported by the attachment projection 200.  Specifically, the attachment projection 200 is positioned to allow the lengthwise
movement of the molding member 52' relative to the cover 50.
 As shown in FIG. 37, the first and second slots 74 and 76 are both laterally and longitudinally offset from one another.  Similarly, the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 are likewise laterally and longitudinally offset from one another.  In
the depicted embodiment, the snap fitting projection 78 and the attachment projection 200 are both located at the second lateral side 94 of the molding member 52'.  However, the snap fitting projection 78 and the attachment projection 200 are spaced
apart from one another in the longitudinal direction of the molding member 52'.  The snap fitting projection 80 and the attachment projection 200 are spaced apart from one another in the lateral direction of the molding member 52'.  As well, the
attachment projection 200 is laterally aligned with portions of the second slot 76 and the snap fitting projection 80.
 In the second embodiment, the molding member 52' and the attachment projection 80 can be made of any of a variety of materials.  For example, the molding member 52' can be made of a plastic or polymer material that has sufficient resiliency and
flexibility such that the attachment projection 200 can snap fit to the cover 50 during assembly of the cover 50 to the molding member 52'.  However, if the molding member 52' is made of a more rigid material, such as stainless steel or chrome plated
metal material, then the dimensions of the attachment projection 200 may need to be modified in order for the attachment projection 200 to snap fit to the cover 50.  Still further, it is also possible to modify the cover 50 with a recess that permits
installation of the molding member 52' to the cover 50, without utilizing a snap fit engagement between the attachment projection 200 and the cover 50, as is described in greater detail below with respect to a third embodiment.
Third Embodiment
 Referring now to FIGS. 38 and 39, a molding assembly in accordance with a third embodiment will now be explained.  In view of the similarity between the first, second and third embodiments, the parts of the third embodiment that are identical to
the parts of the first and second embodiments will be given the same reference numerals as the parts of the first and second embodiments.  Moreover, the descriptions of the parts of the third embodiment that are identical to the parts of the first and
second embodiments may be omitted for the sake of brevity.
 In the third embodiment, the molding assembly includes the molding member 52' and therefore includes all of the features of the molding member 52 described with respect to the first embodiment and further includes the attachment projection 200
of the molding member 52' described with respect to the second embodiment.
 In the third embodiment, the molding assembly further includes a cover 50' that includes all of the features of the cover 50 described above with respect to the first and second embodiments, and further includes a recess 210.  The recess 210 is
formed along the second lateral side 64c of the top section 64 of the cover 50'.  The recess 210 is basically a cutout that is dimensioned such that the attachment projection 200 can pass through the recess 210 when the attachment projection 200 is
aligned with the recess 210.  Specifically, as shown in FIG. 38 the recess 210 is an insertion slot.  As described above with respect to the cover 50, the cover 50' of the third embodiment can undergo limited sliding movement with the snap fitting
projections 78 and 80 installed within the first and second slots 74 and 76.  During installation and/or removal of the snap fitting projections 78 and 80 in and out of the first and second slots 74 and 76, there may be difficulty moving the cover 50'
past the attachment projection 200.  For example, if one or both of the molding member 52' and the cover 50' are made of a rigid material, assembly of the molding member 52' to the cover 50' may make snap fitting engagement between the attachment
projection 200 and the cover 50' difficult.  The recess 210 allows for added ease of assembly and dis-assembly.  Specifically, with the cover 50' installed to the roof ditch 14 as described above and the molding member 52' in an installation orientation
with respect to the cover 50', the attachment projection 200 is aligned with the recess 210 (insertion slot).  As the molding member moves from an installation orientation to an installed orientation, the snap-fitting projections 78 and 80 of the molding
member 52' pass through respective first slot 74 and second slot 76 of the cover 50' while the attachment projection 200 passes through the recess 210 (insertion slot).
 As shown in FIG. 39, once the molding member 52' is slid into a fully installed position or fully attached position relative to the cover 50', the attachment projection 200 no longer aligns with the recess 210 and retains the upper surface 64a
of the top portion 64 of the cover 50' flush to the underside surface 88a of the molding member 52'.
 The various features of the vehicle 10, other than the above described roof ditch 14 and the molding assembly 16, are conventional components that are well known in the art.  Since these various features of the vehicle 10 are well known in the
art, these structures will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein.  Rather, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the components can be any type of structure and/or programming that can be used to carry out
the present invention.
