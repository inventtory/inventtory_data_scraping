abstract: 
 An air splitter panel is attached to a vehicle fascia panel. One of the
     panels has a plurality of longitudinal extending slots and the other of
     the panels has a plurality of fastener holes that register with the
     slots. Fasteners are mounted in each of the holes and extend through the
     slot registered therewith to attach the panels together while permitting
     sliding movement of the splitter panel relative to the fascia panel. A
     yieldable detent acts between the fastener and the one of the panels with
     the slot to block the sliding movement of the splitter panel until a
     force applied upon the splitter panel overcomes the yieldable detent to
     permit the sliding movement of the splitter panel.
