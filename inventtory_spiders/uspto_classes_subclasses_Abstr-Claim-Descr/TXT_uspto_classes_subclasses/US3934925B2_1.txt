abstract: 
To meet the legal requirements for bus safety, all locking devices on
     entrance and emergency doors must be removed before the bus is placed in
     service. For that purpose, the ignition key is made part of a simple
     locking assembly that is used to lock the emergency door. The driver's
     obtaining the key to operate the bus engine, insures the unlocking of the
     emergency door. The unlocking of the entrance door is accomplished by an
     inside pivoted cam assembly, actuated by a locking handle on the outside
     of the bus. The unlocking pivoted cam assembly inside the bus, then
     entirely disengages the door controlling mechanism, which then has normal
     operating freedom.
