abstract: 
 Disclosed are a crime prevention system using human body communication
     and a crime prevention method using human body communication capable of
     actively and effectively preventing a generation of a crime by using
     human body communication. The crime prevention system using human body
     communication includes: a monitoring device attached to a monitoring
     target to sense his physical contact with an observer and providing
     information obtained by monitoring the monitoring target through human
     body communication when body contact of the monitoring target with the
     observer is sensed; and a reception device attached to the observer,
     receiving the monitoring information through human body communication,
     and transmitting the monitoring information to a pre-set destination. A
     criminal act of the monitoring target may be prevented in advance, and
     when a criminal act is attempted, an observer who may fall a victim of
     the criminal act can actively cope with the situation.
