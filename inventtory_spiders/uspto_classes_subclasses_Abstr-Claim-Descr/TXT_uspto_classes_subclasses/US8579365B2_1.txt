PRIORITY CLAIM
 The present application is a National Phase entry of PCT Application No. PCT/JP2010/071528, filed Dec.  25, 2009, which claims priority from Japanese Patent Application Number 2009-150946, filed Jun.  25, 2009, the disclosures of which are
hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
 The present invention relates to an automotive cowl louver support structure having right and left rain gutters that are attached to right and left front pillars supporting vehicle-widthwise both sides of a windshield so as to extend therealong
and that allow rainwater to flow down along the front pillars, in which vehicle-widthwise both sides of a cowl louver disposed between the windshield and a hood can be supported by lower portions of the right and left rain gutters and in which ornamental
surfaces of the rain gutters can be continuous with a ornamental surface of the cowl louver.
BACKGROUND ART
 A technique related to an automotive cowl louver support structure is described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 7-10037.
 In the cowl louver support structure described in Patent Document 1, a cowl louver is attached to a cowl panel of a body by a plurality of clips.
 However, as shown in, for example, FIG. 1, in an automobile provided with rain gutters 102 that allow rainwater on a windshield G to flow down along front pillars 101, it is common practice that vehicle-widthwise both ends of a cowl louver 104
are supported by lower portions of the right and left rain gutters 102.
 That is, as shown in FIG. 6(A), the lower portions of the rain gutters 102 capable of supporting the cowl louver 104 are provided with support plates 103 that project inwardly in a vehicle-widthwise direction.  The support plates 103 have
substantially V-shaped notches 103c that are formed in front end edges thereof.
 Further, as shown in FIG. 6(B), hook portions 106 are formed in the vehicle-widthwise both ends of the cowl louver 104.  The hook portions 106 project downwardly from back side of the cowl louver 104 and are bent backwardly so as to have a
substantially J-shape in side view.  Further, when a back end edge upper portion 104f of the cowl louver 104 is disposed on a lower end periphery of the windshield G, the hook portions 106 of the cowl louver 104 are hooked on the notches 103c of the
support plates 103 from before and below, so that vehicle-widthwise both sides of the cowl louver 104 can be connected to the lower portions of the right and left rain gutters 102.  Further, in this condition, ornamental surfaces 102e of the rain gutters
102 and a ornamental surface 104e of the cowl louver 104 can be continuous with each other.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Problem to be Solved by the Invention
 In the above-described cowl-louver support structure, the hook portions 106 of the cowl louver 104 are hooked on the notches 103c of the support plates 103 of the rain gutters 102 from below, so that both members 104 and 102 can be connected to
each other (FIG. 6(B)).  Therefore, for example, when a downward force is applied to the cowl louver 104, the support plates 103 of the rain gutters 102 cannot support the hook portions 106 of the cowl louver 104, so that the cowl louver 104 can be
displaced downwardly.  As a result, steps can be formed in boundary positions K between the ornamental surfaces 102e of the rain gutters 102 and the ornamental surface 104e of the cowl louver 104.  This may lead to inferior appearance thereof.
 Further, the cowl louver 104 and the rain gutters 102 can be engaged with each other at one position via the hook portions 106 and the support plates 103.  Therefore, the cowl louver 104 is likely to be allowed to rotate horizontally with
respect to the rain gutters 102.  As a result, gaps each of which the width is changed longitudinally can be formed in the boundary positions K between the ornamental surfaces 102e of the rain gutters 102 and the ornamental surface 104e of the cowl
louver 104.  This may lead to inferior appearance thereof.
 Thus, there is a need in the art to provide an improved automotive cowl louver support structure.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 A first aspect of the present invention provides an automotive cowl louver support structure having right and left rain gutters that are attached to right and left front pillars supporting vehicle-widthwise both sides of a windshield so as to
extend therealong and that allow rainwater to flow down along the front pillars, in which vehicle-widthwise both sides of a cowl louver disposed between the windshield and a hood can be supported by lower portions of the right and left rain gutters and
in which ornamental surfaces of the rain gutters can be continuous with a ornamental surface of the cowl louver.  Engaged portions are provided to lower portions of the right and left rain gutters.  Engagement portions configured to engage the respective
engaged portions of the rain gutters are provided to vehicle-widthwise both sides of the cowl louver.  When the cowl louver is set between the right and left rain gutters from a given direction, the engagement portions of the cowl louver are engaged with
the engaged portions of the right and left rain gutters, so that the cowl louver can be prohibited from moving vertically and rotating horizontally relative to the right and left rain gutters.
 According to the present invention, because the engagement portions of the cowl louver are engaged with the engaged portions of the rain gutters, the cowl louver can be prevented from moving vertically with respect to the rain gutters.  As a
result, for example, if an upward or downward force is applied to the cowl louver, the cowl louver can be avoided from being displaced upwardly or downwardly with respect to the rain gutters.  Therefore, any steps (differences in height) cannot be formed
in boundary positions between the ornamental surfaces of the rain gutters and the ornamental surface of the cowl louver.
 Further, because the engagement portions of the cowl louver are engaged with the engaged portions of the rain gutters, the cowl louver can be prohibited from rotating horizontally with respect to the rain gutters.  As a result, for example, if a
horizontally rotational force is applied to the cowl louver, the cowl louver can be prevented from being horizontally rotationally displaced with respect to the rain gutters.  Therefore, any unstable gaps each of which the width is changed longitudinally
cannot be formed in the boundary positions between the ornamental surfaces of the rain gutters and the ornamental surface of the cowl louver.
 Thus, a portion around the cowl louver and the rain gutter can have increased appearance.
 In the second aspect of the present invention, each of the engaged portions of the right and left rain gutters has a first receiving portion on which a first claw portion of each of the engagement portions of the cowl louver is hooked and a
second receiving portion on which a second claw portion of each of the engagement portions of the cowl louver is hooked.  The first and second receiving portions are positioned spaced away from each other in a back and forth direction.
 That is, a plurality of claw portions and a plurality of receiving portions that are respectively formed spaced away from each other are engaged with each other while the engagement portions of the cowl louver and the engaged portions of the
rain gutters are engaged with each other.  Therefore, the cowl louver can be effectively prevented from being horizontally rotationally displaced.
 In the third aspect of the present invention, each of the engaged portions of the right and left rain gutters is formed to have a groove shape that extends in the back and forth direction.  Each of the engagement portions of the cowl louver is
formed to have a ridge shape that extends in the back and forth direction.  Each of the engagement portions is constructed to engage each of the groove-shaped engaged portions of the rain gutters from before.  Each of the groove-shaped engaged portions
of the right and left rain gutters is shaped such that a width thereof can be increased forwardly and reduced backwardly.
 In this way, each of the groove-shaped engaged portions of the rain gutters is shaped such that the width thereof can be increased forwardly.  Therefore, the engagement portions of the cowl louver can be easily engaged with the engaged portions
from before.  Further, each of the engaged portions of the rain gutters is shaped such that the width thereof can be reduced backwardly.  Therefore, in the process in which the engagement portions of the cowl louver are engaged with the engaged portions
from before, the cowl louver can be positioned on a desired position with respect to the rain gutters.
 According to the present invention, any steps (differences in height) and unstable gaps cannot be formed in the boundary positions between the ornamental surface of the cowl louver and the ornamental surfaces of the rain gutters.  As a result,
appearance of the cowl louver and the rain gutters can be prevented from being deteriorated. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

panel 16 (FIG. 2) from below.  Further, as shown in FIG. 2, a section defined between the first ridge portion 31 positioned at a forward end of the cowl louver 30 and an apex portion 33t of the second ridge portion 33 can be covered by a back end
periphery 43 of the engine hood 40.  Further, a weather strip 31w is positioned on and attached to the first ridge portion 31 of the cowl louver 30 while extending along an apex portion of the first ridge portion 31, so as to seal a space between the
engine hood 40 and the cowl louver 30 thereby.
 The ornamental portion 34 of the cowl louver 30 is a portion visible externally and has a seal member 34s that is attached to a the back end periphery of the ornamental portion 34.  As shown in FIG. 2, a lower end periphery Gd of the windshield
G is covered by the seal member 34s over the entire width in the vehicle widthwise direction.  A surface 34e of the ornamental portion 34 corresponds to an ornamental surface of the present invention.  Therefore, the surface 34e of the ornamental portion
34 may be hereinafter referred to as the ornamental surface 34e.
 As shown in FIGS. 3(A) and 3(B), the cowl louver 30 has engagement portions 37 that are formed in vehicle-widthwise both sides (right and left ends) of the ornamental portion 34.  The engagement portions 37 are constructed to be engaged with
engaged portions 25 (which will be herein after described) of the rain gutters 20, so that vehicle-widthwise both sides of the ornamental portion 34 of the cowl louver 30 can be connected to the lower portions of the right and left rain gutters 20 when
the portions 37 and 25 are engaged with each other.
 The right and left engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are formed symmetrically in the vehicle widthwise direction.  Therefore, a structure of the right engagement portion 37 will be described with reference to FIG. 3(B) as a
representative of the engagement portions 37.
 The engagement portion 37 has a plate portion 374.  The plate portion 374 projects downwardly from a back surface of the ornamental portion 34 and extends in a back and forth direction.  The plate portion 374 has a first claw portion 371, a
second claw portion 372 and a connection plate portion 375 that are formed in a right side surface thereof.
 The first claw portion 371 of the engagement portion 37 has a vertical plate portion 371w and a deck portion 371y that is projected backwardly from a lower end of the vertical plate portion 371w, so as to have a reverse-L-shape.  The first claw
portion 371 thus shaped is formed in a back end upper portion of the plate portion 374.  The second claw portion 372 of the engagement portion 37 is constructed of a chevron-shaped rib portion 372r and a deck portion 372y that is projected backwardly
from a lower end of the rib portion 372r.  The second claw portion 372 thus shaped is formed in a front side lower portion of the plate portion 374.  Further, the connection plate portion 375 is formed to be substantially parallel to the back surface of
the ornamental portion 34 while connecting a front surface lower portion of the vertical plate portion 371w of the first claw portion 371 and a back surface upper portion of the rib portion 372r of the second claw portion 372.
 Horizontally (rightwardly) projecting dimensions of the first claw portion 371, the second claw portion 372 and the connection plate portion 375 relative to the plate portion 374 are set to be equal to each other, so that the engagement portion
37 can be formed to have a ridge shape.
 <Regarding the Engaged Portions 25 of the Rain Gutters 20>
 As shown in, for example, FIG. 1(A), the lower portions of the rain gutters 20 are formed to project downwardly beyond the lower end periphery Gd of the windshield G. Further, as shown in, for example, FIG. 4(A), the engaged portion 25 is formed
in a lower left side surface of the right rain gutter 20.  Further, the engaged portion 25 is formed in a lower right side surface of the left rain gutter 20 (FIG. 1(A)).  Further, the engaged portions 25 of the right and left rain gutters 20 are formed
symmetrically in the vehicle widthwise direction.  Therefore, a structure of the right engaged portion 25 will be described with reference to FIGS. 4(A) to 4(C) as a representative of the engaged portions 25.
 The engaged portion 25 has an inner vertical wall portion 251 that constitutes the lower left side surface of the rain gutter 20, and an outer vertical wall portion 253 that is positioned substantially opposite to the inner vertical wall portion
251.  The two vertical wall portions 251 and 253 are formed so as to be higher in front portions thereof and lower in back portions thereof.  Further, back end portions of the inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 of the
engaged portion 25 are connected to each other by a back beam portion 254.  Also, front lower ends of the vertical wall portions 251 and 253 are connected to each other by a bottom plate portion 255.  That is, a front portion of the engaged portion 25 is
defined by the inner vertical wall portion 251, the outer vertical wall portion 253 and the bottom plate portion 255 and is formed to have a substantially U-shaped groove shape.
 Further, the engaged portion 25 has an opening 256 that is formed between the inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 thereof, so as to extend from the bottom plate portion 255 to the back beam portion 254. 
Further, the inner vertical wall portion 251 has a first receiving portion 261 and a second receiving portion 262 that are projected laterally into the opening 256.
 The first receiving portion 261 is formed as a portion on which the first claw portion 371 of the engagement portion 37 of the cowl louver 30 is hooked from before and below.  A rear end periphery of the first receiving portion 261 is connected
to the back beam portion 254.  That is, the first receiving portion 261 is positioned on a rear end position of the opening 256.
 The second receiving portion 262 is formed as a portion on which the second claw portion 372 of the engagement portion 37 of the cowl louver 30 is hooked from before and below and which supports the connection plate portion 375 from below.  As
shown in FIG. 4(C), the second receiving portion 262 is positioned on a the front end position of the opening 256 so as to have the substantially same height as the first receiving portion 261.
 As shown in FIG. 4(B), a distance between the inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 of the engaged portion 25 is set to be increased toward a front end of the engaged portion 25 at a position of the bottom plate
portion 255.  That is, the distance is set to be minimized at a position adjacent to the opening 256.  Further, the distance between the inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 of the engaged portion 25 at the position
adjacent to the opening 256 is set to be substantially equal to a width of the engagement portion 37 of the cowl louver 30.  Further, a distance between distal ends (left ends) of the first receiving portion 261 and the second receiving portion 262 and
the outer vertical wall portion 253 is set such that the plate portion 374 of the engagement portion 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be inserted therebetween (FIG. 5(A)).
 <Regarding Attaching Operation of the Cowl Louver 30>
 An attaching operation of the cowl louver 30 is performed after an attaching operation of the right and left rain gutters 20 is completed.
 That is, in a condition in which the right and left rain gutters 20 are attached, the engagement portions 37 that are formed in the vehicle-widthwise both sides (right and left sides) of the cowl louver 30 are engaged with the engaged portions
25 of the right and left rain gutters 20 from before.  As previously described, the distance between the inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 of the engaged portion 25 of each of the rain gutters 20 is set to be
increased toward the front end of the engaged portion 25 at the position of the bottom plate portion 255, which is shown in, for example, FIG. 4(B).  Therefore, each of the right and left engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be guided by the
inner vertical wall portion 251 and the outer vertical wall portion 253 of the engaged portion 25 of each of the rain gutters 20.  Thus, the engagement portions 37 can be easily fit-engaged with the engaged portions 25.
 Further, as shown in FIGS. 5(A) and 5(B), in a process in which the right and left engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are pressed into the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 from before, the first claw portions 371 of the
engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be inserted into the openings 256 of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, so as to be hooked on the first receiving portions 261 from before and below.  Similarly, the second claw portions 372
of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be inserted into the openings 256 of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, so as to be hooked on the second receiving portions 262 from before and below.  Further, the connection plate
portions 375 of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be supported from below by the second receiving portions 262 of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20.  Further, as shown in FIG. 5(B), lower end surfaces 372e of the second
claw portions 372 of the engagement portions 37 can be supported from below by the bottom plate portions 255 of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20.
 Further, the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are pressed into the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 from before, so that the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be laterally constrained by the inner vertical
wall portions 251 and the outer vertical wall portions 253 of the rain gutters 20.
 That is, the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are engaged with the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, so that the cowl louver 30 can be prohibited from moving vertically and rotating horizontally relative to the rain gutters
20.
 Further, the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are engaged with the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, so that the ornamental surfaces 20e of the rain gutters 20 and the ornamental surface 34e of the cowl louver 30 can be
continuous with each other.
 <Advantage of the Cowl Louver Support Structure According to the Present Embodiment>
 According to the cowl louver support structure according to the present embodiment, because the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are engaged with the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, the cowl louver 30 can be prevented
from moving vertically with respect to the rain gutters 20.  As a result, for example, if an upward or downward force is applied to the cowl louver 30, the cowl louver 30 can be avoided from being displaced upwardly or downwardly with respect to the rain
gutters 20.  Therefore, any steps (differences in height) cannot be formed in boundary positions K between the ornamental surfaces 20e of the rain gutters 20 and the ornamental surface 34e of the cowl louver 30 (FIG. 5(A)).
 Further, because the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are engaged with the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20, the cowl louver 30 can be prohibited from rotating horizontally with respect to the rain gutters 20.  As a result,
for example, if a horizontally rotational force is applied to the cowl louver 30, the cowl louver 30 can be prevented from being horizontally rotationally displaced with respect to the rain gutters 20.  Therefore, any unstable gaps each of which the
width is changed longitudinally cannot be formed in the boundary positions K between the ornamental surfaces 20e of the rain gutters 20 and the ornamental surface 34e of the cowl louver 30.
 Thus, a portion around the cowl louver 30 and the rain gutter 20 can have increased appearance.
 Further, each of the engaged portions 25 of the right and left rain gutters 20 has the first receiving portion 261 on which the first claw portion 371 of each of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 is hooked, and the second
receiving portion 262 on which the second claw portion 372 of each of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 is hooked.  The first and second receiving portions 261 and 262 are positioned spaced away from each other in the back and forth
direction.  That is, a plurality of claw portions 371 and 372 and a plurality of receiving portions 261 and 262 that are respectively formed spaced away from each other are engaged with each other while the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30
and the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 are engaged with each other.  Therefore, the cowl louver 30 can be effectively prevented from being horizontally rotationally displaced.
 Further, each the groove-shaped engaged portions 25 of the right and left rain gutters 20 is shaped such that a width thereof can be increased forwardly.  Therefore, the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be easily engaged with the
engaged portions 25 from before.  Further, each of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 is shaped such that the width thereof can be reduced backwardly.  Therefore, in the process in which the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 are
engaged with the engaged portions 25 from before, the cowl louver 30 can be positioned on a desired position with respect to the rain gutters 20.
 <Modified Forms>
 Further, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, and the embodiment can be easily changed or modified without departing from the gist of the present invention.  For example, in the present embodiment, each of the
engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 is formed to have the ridge shape, and each of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 is formed to have the groove shape.  However, each of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 can be
formed to have a groove shape, and each of the engaged portions 25 of the rain gutters 20 can be formed to have a ridge shape.
 Further, in the above example, each of the engagement portions 37 of the cowl louver 30 has the two front and back claw portions 371 and 372.  Further, the engaged portion 25 of each of the rain gutters 20 has the two front and back receiving
portions 261 and 262 on which the claw portions 371 and 372 are hooked.  However, the number of the claw portions and the receiving portions can be appropriately changed as necessary.
