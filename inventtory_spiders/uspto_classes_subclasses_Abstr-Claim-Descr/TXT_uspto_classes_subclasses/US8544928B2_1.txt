STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH
 Not Applicable.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention relates in general to storage compartments in motor vehicles, and, more specifically, to an expandable compartment on a door panel.
 Typical automobiles and other transportation vehicles include a variety of storage features such as a compartment located along the bottom interior surface of a vehicle side entry door.  This compartment is commonly referred to as a map pocket. 
This pocket is usually molded from hard plastic as an outward extension from the door panel.  The conventional pocket creates a dedicated space/volume for storage intruding into the passenger area regardless of whether anything is actually stored there. 
Furthermore, the opening is usually not covered which detracts from the overall appearance and may allow items to fall out of the map pocket while driving on bumpy surfaces, for example.  Thus, a closable and retractable map pocket would be desirable.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 In one aspect of the invention, a storage compartment is provided for a transportation vehicle.  The vehicle has a door panel with a recess.  A frame comprises a U-shaped member and a flexible spring piece, wherein the U-shaped member has a
first terminus and a second terminus separated by a predetermined distance.  The flexible spring piece has first and second ends connected to the first terminus and the second terminus, respectively.  The flexible spring piece has a length between the
first and second ends greater than the predetermined distance so that the flexible spring piece tends to assume either a closed position proximate the recess or an open position away from the recess.  A pocket cover has a front portion concealing the
frame and has a folding side portion disposed between side and bottom edges of the frame and the door panel along corresponding edges of the recess.  A tether is coupled to the frame for urging the frame toward the door panel while permitting the frame
to be moved away from the door panel. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
 The present invention provides a flexible storage compartment having an upper side that is closable and an outer surface that is expandable to accommodate contents placed therein while minimizing protrusion into the passenger compartment.  The
pocket has a foldable material along the sides and bottom, and includes a soft cover made of PVC, leather, or other material that conforms to the surrounding door panel surfaces when closed thereby providing an improved visual appearance.  A
substantially rigid frame along the sides and bottom of the cover may be constructed of stamped aluminum, or a stiff, injection-molded reinforced plastic resin, for example.  A spring steel member across the top of the U-shaped frame has a length greater
than the distance between the ends of the U-shaped frame in order to provide an opening/closing effect.  Cover material is folded over the frame which also bridges the area between the cover and the door panel when the map pocket is expanded.  Tethers
(such as an elastic cord or mechanical springs) attach the frame to the door panel in order to contract the pocket against the door panel or the contents within the map pocket.  A recess is provided in the door panel in order to obtain a flush fit of the
cover with the door panel when the map pocket is empty.
 Referring now to FIG. 1, a door panel 10 includes a map pocket 11 with an upper edge 12.  A contoured shelf 13 is disposed along upper edge 12 and has a finger notch 14 to create a gap to facilitate grasping of upper edge 12 to pull open map
pocket 11.  Shelf 13 preferably has a concave contoured edge 15 shaped to receive map pocket upper edge 12 when it is closed.  FIG. 2 shows map pocket 11 pulled to an open position creating access to a recess 16 in door panel 10 and the storage space
behind pocket 11.
 The main components of the map pocket are shown in FIG. 3.  A U-shaped member 20 is attached to a flexible spring piece 21.  U-shaped member 20 is substantially rigid and may be comprised of a stamped metal or a molded plastic, for example. 
U-shape member 20 has a first terminus 22 and a second terminus 23 for receiving spring piece 21.  Spring piece 21 has first and second ends 24 and 25 coupled to terminus 22 and terminus 23, respectively.  The length of spring piece 21 between ends 24
and 25 is greater than a distance between terminus 22 and terminus 23.  Thus, spring piece 21 tends to spring to one side or the other between its ends, corresponding to the open and closed positions of the map pocket.
 Spring piece 21 may be connected to U-shaped member 20 via various types of hard connection, such as a weld, a screw, or other fastener.  Preferably, a pivotable connection may be provided by using posts 26 and 27 that are pivotally coupled to
terminus 22 and terminus 23, respectively.  Posts 26 and 27 may include slots (not shown) for receiving ends 24 and 25, thereby allowing spring piece 21 to be moved between its open and closed positions more easily.
 The rectangular frame comprised of U-shaped member 20 and spring piece 21 is retained in a pocket cover 30, including a front portion 31 and a folding side portion 32.  Portions 31 and 32 are preferably constructed of a soft cover stock material
such as PVC, leather, or a durable fabric of a type used in automobile interiors.  Portions 31 and 32 may be a single piece or may be separate pieces as shown in FIG. 3.  The separate pieces may be sewn together, for example.  Front portion 31 is folded
along dashed lines 33 and 34 in order to attach to and conceal U-shaped member 20 and spring piece 21.  After folding, the folds may be glued or sewn in order to permanently retain the frame.
 The map pocket is tethered to the door panel using tethers 35-38.  Each tether has one end connected to the map pocket, e.g., by attaching it to U-shaped member 20 or to a corresponding portion of pocket cover 30 on the outboard side of the
folds (i.e., closest to member 20).  Tethers 35 and 38 connect at the upper ends of the left and right sides of pocket 30, and tethers 36 and 37 connect along the bottom edge of pocket 30.  Tethers 35-38 preferably pass through the door panel and have
their other ends attach to anchor points (not shown) sufficiently removed along the door panel to provide a stretching capacity that accommodates the desired expansion while maintaining an appropriate amount of force for urging the pocket frame toward
the door panel.  The tethers must be sufficiently long to permit the frame to be pulled away from the door panel when inserting contents into the pocket.  Tethers may be preferably comprised of stretchable elastic (commonly referred to as a bungee cord). The majority of the length of the tethers formed of stretchable elastic would be concealed behind the door panel in order to accommodate the desired lengths.  Instead of stretchable elastic, a mechanical spring system or tensioner can be used.
 Each tether can expand independently to achieve different arrangements of contents being placed inside the pocket.  As shown in FIG. 4, upper edge 12 is pulled to an open position and tether 38 is stretched so that cover 30 is expanded along its
upper edge, thereby increasing the opening size for the map pocket.  As shown in FIG. 5, expansion along the bottom edge of the map pocket is obtained by stretching tether 37 in a similar manner.
 FIG. 6 shows a side view of another embodiment in which a door panel 40 has a recess 41.  A frame and pocket cover assembly 42 has a closed, unexpanded position shown at 43.  By pulling on the spring piece of the frame without stretching the
tethers, assembly 42 moves to the open position shown at 44.  By expanding the tethers, frame and pocket cover 42 can be moved to the position shown at 45.
 In the top view of FIG. 7, a tether 46 passes through an opening 47 in door panel 40 proximate an edge of recess 41 and attaches to an anchor point 48 and to frame and pocket cover 42.  Similarly, a tether 50 passes through another opening 51
and attaches to an anchor point 52 and to the opposite side of frame and pocket cover 42 at 53.  The majority of the length of each tether 46 and 50 is disposed between openings 47 and 51 and anchor points 48 and 52, respectively.  The extra length
allows expansion to the position shown at 45 while maintaining a closing force in both positions that urges frame and cover 42 toward door panel 42 at all times, while maintaining the force at an appropriate level to allow expansion away from door panel
40.
