BACKGROUND
 The discussion below is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.
 Aspects of the present invention relate to a sunshade assembly having opposed longitudinal edges and opposed transversal edges, the longitudinal edges being adapted to be guided in non parallel guide rails, the sunshade assembly comprising a
flexible screen, said screen having a transversal edge connected to a beam, and having opposed lateral screen parts biased in lateral direction.
 A sunshade assembly known from the prior art is EP 2 230 115 A1.  This sunshade assembly has a cloth, which is movable and guided in guide rails, between a wound and unwound position.  Said guide rails are non parallel with respect to each
other.  A triangular flexible lateral element in the form of a lateral rollo blind is connected between the main cloth and one of the guide rails.  In an unwound position of the main sunshade assembly, the lateral rollo blind is unwound and covers a
lateral triangular area.  When the sunshade assembly is wound, the lateral rollo blind is wound as well.
 This prior art sunshade assembly solves the guiding problem of a sunshade assembly that has non parallel guide rails, however is rather complex in its functionality and it needs numerous parts for storing the lateral triangular areas of cloth.
 In general it is required that the cloth, and especially said lateral triangular parts are kept taut, without any wrinkles.
SUMMARY
 This Summary and the Abstract herein are provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.  This Summary and the Abstract are not intended to identify key features or
essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor are they intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.  The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted
in the Background.
 A sunshade assembly according to an aspect of the invention has at least one of said lateral screen parts configured to adjustably fold around a folding member through an angle of substantially 180.degree.  along at least a part of the length of
the corresponding longitudinal edge of the sunshade assembly.  The extreme ends of the lateral parts folded around the folding members are biased in lateral direction, so as to keep the screen taut across its lateral width.
 In one embodiment the lateral screen parts of the flexible screen are each folded around a folding member which is a wire.  Said wire may be positioned in or in the vicinity of the longitudinal guide rails and is kept taut in a longitudinal
direction, for example by tensioning it between a rollo shaft or rollo reel and a rollo beam, or in any other way known per se.
 To facilitate the lateral movement of the lateral screen parts around the wire, the wire may be equipped with a sleeve, which could be made of plastic, or any other suitable material.
 It is conceivable that the folding member is configured as a bending resistant rod, preferably made of steel or any other suitable material.  Said rod is stationary and may be connected to a stationary member of the open roof construction, for
instance to the respective guide rail on a first end, and to another stationary member on the other end.  It is also conceivable that only one end of the rod is supported by the stationary member of the open roof construction.  The longitudinal shape of
each rod substantially corresponds to that of the respective guide rail.
 In another embodiment, the sunshade assembly comprises a substantially rigid center member and two opposed rigid lateral members, said lateral members are pivotally connected with the center member in an area near a first transversal edge, and
are connected to a guiding member in the respective guide rail near a second transversal edge.  Said center member is also guided in the guide rail by a guiding member.  The screen is folded around each of the lateral members, whereby the area of the
lateral members adjacent to the screen have a rounded shape suitable to smoothly fold the lateral screen parts and guide their movements.
 A biasing element keeps the lateral screen parts taut in lateral direction, whereby the biasing element may be a separate part made of flexible and elastic material, sufficient to keep the screen taut, but also capable of being wound on a rollo
shaft in case the sunshade assembly is a roller screen.  Said elastic member is connected on a first end to one of said lateral screen parts and on a second end to the opposite lateral screen part, or said second end may be connected to the upper side of
the flexible screen, or to the center member, said second may also be connected to a beam, said beam forms a transversal edge of the sunshade assembly.
 In another embodiment the area of the folding member engaging the screen is covered with a friction reducing coating.  This facilitates movements of the lateral screen parts with respect to the folding members.
 In yet another embodiment the screen and the lateral screen parts may be made of different materials fixed, for example, stitched together, whereby the lateral screen parts may be made of an elastic material.  It is also conceivable that said
elastic flexible screen parts are biased in lateral direction and are connected to the upper side of the screen directly, thus avoiding a separate elastic member. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
 Referring to FIG. 1, a vehicle having an open roof construction in its roof is illustrated schematically.  Said open roof construction comprises a roof opening 1 in a stationary roof part 2 of the vehicle, such as a passenger car, and a movable
closure, for example a panel 3 which, by means not illustrated but known per se, can be moved for opening and closing said roof opening 1.  In the embodiment shown, the open roof construction is a so-called spoiler roof or topslider in which the panel 3
is moved from a closed position within the roof opening 1 rearwardly to an open position in which the panel is partly or completely above a roof part behind the roof opening.  Other closures, such as slats, a folding member and the like are useable with
aspects of the invention herein described.
 Below the roof opening 1, a sunshade assembly is arranged.
 Referring to FIG. 2, the sunshade assembly is configured as a so called "rollo" or roller screen which comprises a flexible screen 4 having opposed longitudinal edges (extending mainly in longitudinal direction of the vehicle) and opposed
transversal edges, the longitudinal edges being guided in non parallel guide rails 5, 5'.  Said guide rails 5, 5' may be straight or may have a curvature individually, but are aligned towards each other in such a way that they are diverging from each
other, in this case towards the front of the roof opening 1.
 A first one of the transversal edges of the flexible screen 4 is connected to a rotatable winding shaft 6 configured for winding and unwinding said sunscreen, a second transversal edge being connected to a beam 7 for tensioning and unwinding
said sunscreen in a longitudinal direction.  Said winding shaft 6 is known per se, and is therefore not further elucidated.  In FIG. 2, the sunshade assembly is shown in a rolled out or unwound condition in which it closes a passage in a frame of the
open roof construction below the roof opening 1.  The screen 4 is connected to the beam 7, in a way known per se, and is not further elucidated.  Each end of the beam 7 has a joint with a guiding member 10, 10'.  Said joint adapts to the changing
distance between the non parallel guide rails 5, 5' and one end of the beam 7, 7' when the sunshade assembly is unwound, or wound.  The joint might include a lever between the beam 7 and the guide member 10, 10', respectively, being pivotable on both
ends to take up the distance between the guide member 10, 10' and the respective beam end by pivoting.
 The changing distance between the non parallel guides 5, 5' is taken up by the screen 4 through lateral screen parts 8, 8', said parts moving in lateral direction and moving around a folding member 9A (see FIG. 3), and further in lateral
direction towards the opposite guide rails 5,5' when the screen 4 is wound or unwound.
 As mentioned, the sunshade assembly further comprises opposed lateral screen parts 8, 8' biased in lateral direction.  Said lateral screen parts 8, 8' may be made of the same material, and may be made in one integral piece, including formed from
a single unitary body, with a center part of the flexible screen 4.  On the other hand, the lateral screen parts 8, 8' may be made of a different material compared to that of the center part of the flexible screen 4.  It is also conceivable that the
lateral screen parts 8, 8' are made of elastic materials, and be connected with the center part of the flexible screen 4 by stitching, gluing, welding or any other suitable way known per se.
 Referring to FIG. 3, portions of said lateral screen parts 8, 8' are folded around the folding member 9A, are arranged vertically above the screen 4 and are directed in a direction substantially towards the opposing folding member 9A.  It is
clear that in an embodiment where the folding member 9A is a wire or other flat member, as is the case in the FIG. 3 embodiment, the portion of the folded lateral screen parts 8, 8' pointing in the direction towards the opposite guide rail may lie
substantially on top of and substantially in contact with the upper side of the screen 4.  The lateral screen parts 8, 8' may be of a substantially triangular shape, however any other shape, for instance rectangular, or circular shapes are possible too. 
The folded lateral screen parts 8, 8' may thus be folded around the folding member 9A in an angle of substantially 180.degree., however an angle slightly smaller or bigger is possible too.  In general an angle in a range between 160.degree.  and
200.degree.  would be sufficient.  In order to reduce the friction between the lateral screen parts 8, 8' and the folding member or wire 9A to facilitate the lateral movement of the lateral screen part around a substantial portion of the wire 9A and
along a substantial length of the longitudinal edge of the sunscreen 4, it is conceivable to have a flexible sleeve 15 around the folding member 9A, especially in case the folding member is a wire 9A or a bending-stiff rod 9B shown in FIG. 4.  Such a
sleeve avoids the risk of having excessive wear at the inside of the lateral screen parts 8, 8'.
 The lateral screen parts 8, 8' are biased in lateral direction towards the opposite guide rail 5, 5'.  The biasing force originates from an elastic member 14, which may be an elastic band, flat spring or equivalent.  It is important however that
the elastic member 14 has enough biasing force in lateral direction to keep the screen and its lateral screen parts 8, 8' taut across the width of opening 1.  The elastic member 14 needs to be flexible to such extent that it is able to be rolled up
together with the screen onto the winding shaft 6, without leaving marks on the neighboring screen material, when the rollo is unwound again.
 The elastic member 14 may be connecting the two opposite lateral screen parts 8, 8', however it is also conceivable that the elastic member 14 connects each of the lateral screen parts 8, 8' with the beam 7,7' (FIG. 8) or as mentioned before
connecting the lateral screen parts 8, 8' with the upper side of the screen 4.  The wire 9A will generally be wound together with the screen 4, for example on a reel arranged on the winding shaft.  One end of the wire 9A will therefore be attached to the
reel, the other end will be attached to the guiding member 10, 10'.  It will be kept taut between its ends so as to be able to withstand the tensioning force of the elastic member 14.
 Referring to FIG. 4, which also shows a sunshade assembly in the form of a rollo or roller screen, the folding member shown there is a bending stiff or rigid rod 93 in each guide rail 5, 5'.  Said rod 9B is connected to a stationary member of
the open roof construction, for instance to the respective guide rail on a first end, whereas on its second end said rod is also connected to the stationary member.  It is also conceivable that only one end of the rod is supported by the stationary
member of the open roof construction.  The portion of the folded lateral screen parts 8, 8' pointing in the direction towards the opposite guide rail lies substantially above and with a certain distance to the upper side of screen 4.  As the rods 9B are
stationary, the lateral screen parts 8, 8' will slide with respect to the rods 9B both in longitudinal and lateral direction.  The material of the lateral screen parts 8, 8' and rod 9B could be selected to obtain a low friction and/or the rod could be
rotatable.
 FIGS. 5, 6 and 7, show an embodiment of the sunshade assembly which is configured as a rigid sunshade screen or panel.  It comprises a center member 11, and two opposed lateral members 12, 12' and a beam 7'.  The sunshade assembly is capable of
sliding at each of the opposed longitudinal edges in a pair of opposed lateral guide rails 5, 5'.  Since the guide rails 5, 5' are non-parallel relative to each other, the lateral width between the longitudinal edges of the sunshade assembly varies from
a condition in which the width is of a certain minimal dimension, there where the distance between the guide rails 5, 5' is smallest, to a condition in which said width has reached a maximum dimension, there where the distance between the guide rails 5,
5' is biggest.
 To accommodate the difference in width the sunshade has a center member 11, and two lateral members 12, 12' pivotally connected therewith by means of pivot members 13, 13'.  Each of the lateral members 12, 12' has at least two guiding members
10, 10', connected therewith, directly and/or indirectly (as shown in FIG. 7).  Said guiding members 10, 10' are configured to slidably support the sunshade assembly in the guide rails 5, 5'.  The pivot members 13, 13' may be positioned in an area near a
first transversal edge of the sunshade, usually near the transversal edge where the sunshade assembly has a minimum lateral width.  Said pivot members 13, 13' are known per se, and therefore not further elucidated.  The pivot members 13, 13' are oriented
such that the lateral members 12, 12' pivot parallel to plane of the center member 11, and thus the pivot axis is oriented substantially perpendicularly to the plane of the center member 11.  The folding member in this embodiment is a rounded portion 9C
on the lateral outer side of the folding members 12, 12' where the lateral screen parts 8, 8' are folded or guided through substantially 180.degree., see FIG. 5.
 In a situation in which the sunshade assembly slides between an "open" position and a "close" position, as shown in FIG. 7, the lateral members 12, 12' will follow the curvature of the non parallel guide rails 5, 5' due to the engagement of
their guiding members 10, 10' with the guide rails 5, 5'.  When doing so, each of said lateral members will rotate around pivot member 13, 13'.  A screen 4 is arranged on the lower side of said center member 11, and the lateral members 12, 12', in such a
way that it is adjacent to the lower surfaces of said members 11, 12, 12'.  The screen 4 may be connected with the center member 11, in a way known per se.  It is also conceivable that the screen 4 is not connected to the lower side of said center member
11.  In relation to the lateral members 12, 12', the screen 4 is not connected to their respective lower and upper surfaces, since said member must be able to move in lateral direction.  As already explained before with respect to other embodiments, the
screen 4 has lateral screen parts 8, 8' which, in this embodiment, are folded around a rounded portion 9C of the lateral members 12, 12'.  The lateral screen parts 8, 8' are biased above the upper surface of the center member 11 and of the lateral
members 12, 12' in a direction towards the opposite guide rail 5, 5'.  In this case, the lateral screen parts 8, 8' are biased by their own elastic member 14, 14' which is connected to the respective lateral screen part 8, 8' on one end and to the center
member 11 on the other end.  The rounded portion 9c of the lateral member 12, 12', around which the lateral screen parts 8, 8' are folded, have a typical shape so as to ensure a reduced contact area and a minimum of friction between the two parts.  It is
conceivable that said rounded portion 9C of said lateral member 12, 12' is coated with a coating reducing the friction between screen and member material.
 It follows from the foregoing that an aspect of the invention provides a sunshade assembly that easily adapts to non parallel guide rails and nonetheless maintains an attractive appearance towards the interior of the vehicle in all
circumstances.
 Although the subject matter has been described in language directed to specific environments, structural features and/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not limited to the
environments, specific features or acts described above as has been held by the courts.  Rather, the environments, specific features and acts described above are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims.  In addition, features of one
