abstract: 
A divider which is for use in the occupant compartment of a vehicle and
     which includes upper and lower portions. The lower portion of the divider
     is hinged to the upper portion thereof and is shiftable between a closed
     position in which the upper and lower divider portions are generally
     coplanar and an open position. The divider is positioned above the front
     occupant's seat and extends vertically between the seat and the roof of
     the vehicle and traversely between the vehicle sides. The upper portion of
     the divider is connected to the vehicle so as to allow the lower portion
     of the divider to shift between its closed position serving to isolate the
     front section of the occupant compartment of the vehicle and its open
     position allowing for communication over the front occupant's seat.

patent_description: 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to a divider or partitioning member which is placed between the front and back seats of a motor vehicle and which serves to reduce the area of heating and cooling within the occupant compartment of the vehicle.
The divider of this invention includes upper and lower portions which are interconnected by hinge means.  The upper portion of the divider is secured to the interior of the occupant compartment of the vehicle over the back rest of the vehicle's
front seat.  The lower portion of the divider is shiftable about its hinge means between a closed position in which it is generally aligned with the upper interconnected portion of the divider to form an isolating partition between the upper edge of the
front seat and the vehicle roof and an open position in which it provides an open space between the upper edge of the front seat of the vehicle and the roof thereof so as to allow for air flow, such as during cooling and heating, and conversation to pass
between the front and rear seats of the vehicle.
It is an object of this invention to provide a divider for use in the occupant compartment of a vehicle which separates the occupant compartment into two sections at the front seat of the vehicle.
Another object of this invention is to provide a divider or partition having open and closed positions which when in its closed position isolates the front seat portion of the occupant compartment of the vehicle from the back seat portion
thereof.
Still another object of this invention is to provide a divider for the occupant compartment of a vehicle by which air conditioning and heating within the vehicle is restricted to the front seat area thereof.
Other objects of this invention will become apparent upon a reading of the invention's description. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

FIG. 8 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the divider. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
The preferred embodiments illustrated are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.  They are chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its application and
practical use to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention.
In FIG. 1, a motor vehicle 10 is shown.  Vehicle 10 includes an occupant compartment 12, partially enclosed by a roof 14 and spaced sides 16.  A front seat 18 and a back seat 20 are located within compartment 12.  Front seat 18 includes a back
rest 22 which carries head rests 24.
The divider 26 of this invention includes an upper portion 28 and a lower portion 30, each of which is preferably planar.  Lower portion 30 is hinged to upper portion 28 so as to be shiftable relative to the upper portion of the divider.  The
manner of hinging lower portion 30 to upper portion 28 of the divider may vary.  In FIGS. 1-6, the lower portion 30 is hinged to upper portion 28 by means of hinge brackets 32.  In FIG. 8 the hinge 32' is molded onto portions 28 and 30 as an integral
part of the divider.  In FIG. 7 the upper divider portion 28 is formed of a relatively stiff material and the lower divider portion 30 is formed of a flexible material so as to form a bend or hinge 32" just below where portion 30 joins portion 28.  Upper
and lower portions 28 and 30 may be formed of a variety of materials, such as fiberglass or plastic.  In the case of a plastic it is preferable that the material be transparent so as not to reduce the rear vision of the driver of the vehicle or reduce
the forward vision of any passengers riding in vehicle back seat 20.
Portions 28 and 30 of the divider extend transversely of the vehicle from one side 16 to the other side 16 thereof.  Upper portion 28 has its upper edge 36 preferably formed on a curvature which conforms to the transverse inner surface of the
vehicle roof 14 above back rest 22 of front seat 18 of the vehicle.  A pair of brackets 38 are utilized to secure divider 26 at its upper portion 28 to the vehicle.  Brackets 38 include a flange part 40 and a channel part 42.  Each bracket 38 is mounted
at its flange part 40 to the vehicle center post 44 or similar accessible location in general alignment with back rest 22 of front seat 18 of the vehicle.  Channel parts 42 of brackets 38 are oppositely positioned and extend into the interior of the
vehicle.  Ends 46 of upper portions 28 of the divider fit into bracket channel parts 42 with upper edge 36 of portion 28 being positioned closely adjacent and following the inner surface of roof 14.  With upper portion 28 of the divider so supported
within occupant compartment 12 of the vehicle by brackets 28, lower portion 30 of the divider is shiftable about hinge brackets 32 from a closed position, such as that illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 in which the lower divider portion extends to the
upper edge of back rest 22 of vehicle front seat 18, and an open position, such as that illustrated in FIG. 4 in which the lower divider portion is swung rearwardly relatively to the vehicle, to provide an opening between the lower edge of divider
portion 28 and the front seat of the vehicle.
The outer edges of the lower divider portion are notched or cut away so as to accommodate brackets 38.  Each lower outer edge of lower divider portion 30 is provided with an eyelet 47 by which the lower divider portion when swung into its open
position can be connected to the clothes hook 48 usually provided within the interior of the vehicle occupant compartment.  If no clothes hook is available, a suitable hook can be provided and secured to the frame adjacent the roof of the vehicle.  Lower
divider portion 30 remains in its closed position through the help of gravity and a slight amount of friction existing within hinge brackets 38.  If desired, a suitable hook can be located near one or both of the head rests 24 of the vehicle to secure
the lower divider portion in its closed position.
In FIG. 8, divider 26 is shown with a molded hinge construction 32' interconnecting its upper portion 28 and lower portion 30.  The manner of operation and attachment of this embodiment of the divider is the same as that previously described for
the divider illustrated in FIGS. 1-5.
In FIG. 6 ends 46 of upper divider portion 28 are provided with overlapping extensions 50.  Each extension 50 is connected to an end 46 of the upper divider portion by means of screws 52 which extend through slotted openings 54 in the extension
and which are turned into the upper divider portion.  Slots 54 allow extensions 50 to slide outwardly and inwardly as indicated by arrows 56 in FIG. 6 so as to extend the size of the upper portion 28 of the divider in order to accommodate vehicles of
various width as measured between sides 16.
The lower edge of lower divider portion 30 may be notched at 58 to accommodate head rests 24 carried by front seat 18 of the vehicle.
It is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the details above given but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims.
