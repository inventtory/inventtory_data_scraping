[Solution] Wire ropes 17, 18 with which an X-ray irradiation unit 5 is suspended and supported are formed by wire ropes which are different in fatigue strength causing the progress of fatigue of the wire ropes 17, 18 to be at different stages. Accordingly, the wire rope 17 or 18 that has the lower fatigue strength will experience a break before the other to at least prevent both the wire ropes 17, 18 from experiencing breaks at the same time.",WO,,WO2016186A1,,,,,,,,,A61B6/00,,,,"Patent 1: X-RAY PHOTOGRAPHING DEVICE Inventor: , Inventor:, , HIRATA GORO [JP], KAWANO MASAHIRO [JP], , Applicant: , Applicant:, , SHIMADZU CORP [JP], , CPC:  IPC: A61B6/00 Publication info: WO2016186123 (A1), 2016-11-24 Priority date: 2015-05-21
