abstract: 
'PremA193' is a new and distinct apple tree (Malus domestica Mill.) notable for its attractive blush color and excellent flavor and texture.


patent_description: 
Genus and species: Malus domestica Mill.     Variety denomination: PremA193.     CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS    Provisional application No. 61/208,863, filed on Feb. 26, 2009.     STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT    None     BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE VARIETY    The new variety of apple tree PremA193 was created in the course of a planned breeding program carried out in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. PremA193 originated as a result of a controlled cross of Braeburn (not patented, seed parent) and Tenroy (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 4,121, pollen parent). PremA193 was selected as a single plant from among a population of seedlings derived from the parents, and was selected for its attractive fruit and its excellent flavor and texture. It is distinguished from its parents and the related cultivar Scifresh (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 13,888) in its time of flowering. In Hawkes Bay, New Zealand Braeburn flowers early whereas Tenroy flowers late and PremA193 flowers in mid season at the same time as Granny Smith. The related cultivar Scifresh flowers early. The harvest date (in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand) for PremA193 is late March and for Royal Gala (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 4,121) it is the third week of February. Fruit over color for PremA193 is a lighter and brighter color compared with Braeburn. Asexual propagation by budding was first carried out in Havelock North, New Zealand. The variety has since been observed over a number of asexually propagated generations, and has been found to remain true to type.     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS    FIG. 1 shows the fruit and leaves of PremA193; and     FIG. 2 shows whole and sectioned fruit of PremA193.     DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION    The following detailed botanical description is based on observations of ten year old PremA193 apple trees grown at Havelock North, New Zealand. Color descriptions refer to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, published in 2001. It should be understood that the characteristics described will vary somewhat depending upon cultural practices and climatic conditions, and can vary with location and season. Quantified measurements are expressed as an average of measurements taken from a number of individual plants of the new variety. The measurements of any individual plant, or any group of plants, of the new variety may vary from the stated average.      Tree:                                  Vigor.Vigorous.
