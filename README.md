# inventtory_data_scraping
data project

This is to test that I can connect to the inventtory repository - inventtory_data_scraping - Seraphina. 

Note: This may be a handy place to create a "user manual" - and to add any useful knowledge on Scrapy - i.e. commands, robot names, settings features, etc...

***You may delete the above when you find it!***
